APW_ENG_19941201.0001;0	Fire continued to burn inside the Achille Lauro early Thursday , a day after the flames forced the nearly 1,000 people aboard take to lifeboats and abandon the cruise ship off Somalia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;1	Two people were reported dead and one missing in the flight from the Achille Lauro , which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;2	Overflights by U.S. Navy helicopters at dawn Thursday found the ship listing but in no danger of sinking some 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- offshore in the Indian Ocean , said Cmdr. T. McCreary , spokesman US Naval Forces Central Command in the Gulf .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;3	After fighting the blaze , the last 60 crewmembers abandoned the badly listing vessel Wednesday and boarded merchant ships helping in the rescue .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;4	The 23,478-ton vessel was 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- south of the Horn of Africa when the crewmembers left .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;5	`` I just passed the Achille Lauro overhead and she is fully engulfed , almost now in flames .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;6	Flames have progressed far forward in the ship , '' said U.S. Navy pilot Lt. Paul Frost , who flew over the site Wednesday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;7	Eight people were injured in the fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;8	The ship 's owner , Genoa-based Starlauro , said the blaze apparently broke out in the passenger area , but the cause was unknown .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;9	Capt. Ferdinando Lolli , a port official in Rome , said the ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;10	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch and British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;11	Late Wednesday evening , Italian Coast Guard officials reported that one person from the Achille Lauro was still unaccounted for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;12	The two reported dead were identified by Italian news agencies as a Briton and a German .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;13	The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian King was one of the first ships to arrive at the scene and took on about 800 people , said a coast guard official in Rome , Adm. Eugenio Sicurezza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;14	The Liberian-registered Bar Du , and a Greek ship , the Treasure Island , also were picking up passengers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;15	Two U.S. warships , the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton , reached the scene overnight and dispatched helicopters to ferry water , food and medical supplies to the survivors , said McCreary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;16	The commerical and Navy ships will divide up the passengers Thursday and send them on , mostly to Mombasa , Kenya , and Djibouti , McCreary said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;17	Others reportedly will be taken to the Seychelles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;18	All three destinations are about 1,930 kilometers -LRB- 1,200 miles -RRB- away from the Achille Lauro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;19	The Achille Lauro left Genoa on Nov. 19 , stopped in Israel , and its next port of call was to be Durban , South Africa , on Friday , said Carla Gotta , a spokeswoman for the cruise ship 's owner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;20	The terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985 shot American Leon Klinghoffer and pushed him in his wheelchair off the ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;21	The hijackers escaped the vessel and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;22	The Achille Lauro resumed service as a cruise ship shortly after the hijacking .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;23	Klinghoffer 's convicted killer is serving a 30-year term in an Italian prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;24	Two other men are serving lesser terms and a fourth person , 17 at the time of the hijacking and tried as a juvenile , was paroled in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;25	George Bennett , spokesman for the U.N. operation in Somalia , said the Achille Lauro 's position was close to the small Somali fishing village of Eil , about 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- off the coast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;26	Launched in 1946 in the Netherlands , the Achille Lauro was acquired 20 years later by the Neapolitan shipping dynasty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;27	Its sides painted a royal blue , the Achille Lauro first transported Italian immigrant workers to and from Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;28	In 1970 it was outfitted for pleasure cruises .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;29	But it has had its share of problems : The liner rammed a fishing boat in 1971 off Italy , killing a Neapolitan fisherman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;30	On Dec. 2 , 1981 , fire broke out aboard ship off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0001;31	Panicked passengers jumped into the sea , and two of them drowned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;0	Prime Minister Jean Chretien has started a week-long trip to Europe as concerns about 55 Canadian peacekeepers detained in Bosnia threaten to overshadow his remarks today to the French Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;1	Chretien is only the second leader to be invited to speak to the French Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;2	The first was German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;3	While in Paris , Chretien will also attend a world summit on AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;4	In his remarks to the Senate , the prime minister plans to stress trade and commercial links with France while playing down concerns about Canadian unity , federal officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;5	But these comments may take a back seat to worries about Canadian troops who continue to be held by Serbian forces and wider concerns about the future of United Nations ' peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;6	The prime minister arrived in Paris late Wednesday as a rift between the United States and other allies seemed to deepen over what role United Nations ' forces should play in the war-torn eastern European country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;7	`` The Americans want to control everything and fight down to the last Canadian and Frenchmen , '' Chretien said in an interview published Wednesday in the French daily Le Monde .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;8	Congressional leaders from the United States , which has committed no ground troops in the former Yugoslavia , said this week that UN peacekeeping efforts there are a failure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;9	Chretien said again that the U.S. is in no position to criticize UN efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;10	But the prime minister also suggested in the interview that it 's time to reconsider the role of peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;11	`` The peacekeepers in Bosnia have become a sort of armed Red Cross in a badly defined role .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;12	To be in Bosnia is difficult for us .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;13	It 's a European problem and we are North Americans , '' he told Le Monde .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;14	A senior Canadian official in Paris , speaking on condition of anonymity , also said the prime minister would not turn down the opportunity to intervene personally if that would help win the release of Canadian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;15	The Bosnian situation is evolving hour by hour and will top the agenda in meetings in France with President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur , the Canadian official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;16	Canada has about 2,000 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia , the third largest force from UN countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;17	In Bosnia , Canada has about 800 troops , Britain 3,517 and France 4,354 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;18	Bosnia is also expected to top the agenda when Chretien travels Sunday to Budapest for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;19	On another matter , the federal official said Chretien will answer questions about Canadian unity if they 're raised by French officials but wo n't broach the subject himself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;20	In his interview with Le Monde , the prime minister repeated that Ottawa has no intention of trying to defuse separatist sentiments in Quebec with federal spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;21	`` I will not buy Quebecers ' votes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;22	I have too much respect for them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0002;23	Quebecers are not for sale , they are rational , they will consider coldly their main interests and those of their children . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0003;0	Malaysian tin closed at dlrs 15.27 per kilo Thursday , up 20 cents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;0	A year that began with bitter disappointment is ending in superb fashion for Todd Eldredge of the United States and Surya Bonaly of France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;1	Both skaters are on hot streaks early in this figure skating season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;2	They won the International Pro-Am Challenge on Wednesday , giving Bonaly her fourth successive win and Eldredge his second and third straight strong showing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;3	Viktor Petrenko , the 1992 Olympic champion , was first in the free skate , worth two-thirds the total score .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;4	But the Ukrainian was fifth entering the program and could move up only to third .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;5	Eldredge won the technical routine on Tuesday and , skating to music from the film `` Gettysburg , '' was tied for second behind Petrenko in the free skate , giving him the title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;6	He also won Skate America last month , but this field was stronger , including defending Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov of Russia , who tied Eldredge on Wednesday night and was second overall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;7	`` I had a very good short program and then I put a decent long program out there , '' Eldredge said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;8	`` I think everybody had a bobble here and there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;9	`` With the past two Olympic champions , that makes it a tough field . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;10	Eldredge , 23 , won the 1990 and '91 U.S. titles , then sustained a back injury that disrupted his career .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;11	He was a stunning fourth at the nationals in January , failing to make the Olympic and world team .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;12	Bonaly , who struggled at the Olympics , then claimed home-ice judging cost her the world championship , won the free skate with all seven judges , passing Olga Markova of Russia for the title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;13	Bonaly previously won the Goodwill Games , Skate America and Trophy of France this season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;14	The streak comes after she entered the Lillehammer Olympics as one of the favorites and finished a weak fourth , then was second at the worlds , held in Japan , to Yuka Sato .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;15	Bonaly , 20 , is trying to think only happy thoughts these days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;16	It seems to be working for the four-time European champ who has been criticized for her lack of artistry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;17	`` I wish and hope I am going to be accepted , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;18	`` It 's a long time I have been working on it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;19	I hope one day they will realize I did my job well and did my work .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;20	I ca n't say it was 100 percent excellent today , but I did my job . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;21	Before a crowd of 6,414 , Bonaly delivered a solid performance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;22	She hit six triple jumps but did little in between , with virtually no footwork and little imagination to her program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;23	`` It was OK .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;24	It can be better , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;25	`` I was a little tired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;26	I will be in better shape for the next competition . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;27	Bonaly is the top-ranked woman in the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;28	Most of the better female skaters turned pro and China 's Lu Chen rarely has skated since winning a bronze medal at the Olympics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;29	Michelle Kwan , the top-rated American amateur skater , was second in the free skate and finished third overall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;30	Kwan now will take time off from competition after finishing behind Bonaly in all four events this season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;31	The other disciplines went to Russian couples , with Americans challenging the world champions in pairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;32	Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov barely edged U.S. champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand in pairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;33	Both couples performed superbly , as did third-place finishers Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen , also of the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;34	All three pairs received at least one first-place vote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0013;35	Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov , in their first international appearance , were sensational in winning the ice dance with a flamenco presentation that earned first place from all of the judges .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;0	The mother of a British backpacker found murdered told a court Thursday that her daughter was `` bright and bubbly '' when they spoke on the phone days before she disappeared from a Sydney hostel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;1	Jacqueline and Ian Clarke , parents of Caroline Clarke , also identified a hairbrush police found in raids on the homes of suspect Ivan Milat and two of his brothers as identical to one their daughter had when she left their house in Northumberland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;2	Clarke also said a sleeping bag recovered during the raids was similar to one he remembered his daughter having .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;3	Caroline Clarke and her traveling companion Joanne Walters were last seen April 19 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;4	Mrs. Clarke told Campbelltown Local Court she had spoken to her daughter by telephone a week to 10 days before Easter 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;5	`` She was quite bright and bubbly ... she sounded happy and everything seemed fine , '' said Mrs. Clarke , who has traveled from Britain to give evidence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;6	English stockbroker Stephen Wright also testified Thursday that a tent seized in the raids was the same one he gave Clarke when he , Clarke and Walters traveled together in Tasmania in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;7	Wright said he recognized the tent by the address labels he used to make repairs after it was damaged by a knife he used while picking grapes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;8	Wright also identified a sleeping bag as one he saw Walters buy during their trip to Tasmania .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;9	The tent and the sleeping bag were allegedly found in the home of Richard Milat on the day police arrested Ivan Milat , 49 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;10	Milat was charged in May with the murders of Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist , both 19 ; German backpackers Simone Schmidl , 21 , Gabor Neugebauer , 21 , and Anja Habschied , 20 ; and Britons Clarke , 21 , and Walters , 22 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;11	Milat has denied the charges .
APW_ENG_19941201.0004;12	If convicted , he could be sentened to life in prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;0	Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombing of Japan and anti-nuclear bomb activists said Thursday they are angry about a U.S. Postal Service plan to issue a stamp commemorating the attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;1	`` This is outrageous , '' said Sunao Tsuboi , acting director of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-bomb Survivors Organizations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;2	`` It makes our blood boil with anger , '' he told the Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;3	Tsuboi was commenting on the stamp 's caption : `` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;4	Many critics of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9 that year say there were more humane ways to make Japan surrender , ending World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;5	The stamp design , a composite of mushroom clouds created by the wartime bombings and nuclear tests after the war , is scheduled to be released next year around the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;6	About 140,000 of Hiroshima 's 340,000 residents died within five months after the Aug. 6 raid , while the attack on Nagasaki killed another 70,000 of that city 's 270,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;7	Japan surrendered on Aug. 15 , 1945 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;8	Tsuboi said his organization will consult with other anti-nuclear groups in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on what action to take against the stamp .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;9	`` The use of weapons of mass destruction like those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki should never be legitimated under any circumstances , '' said Kazuya Yasuda , a top official of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs , a private group campaigning to abolish nuclear arms worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;10	Local officials in both cities also expressed displeasure with the stamp .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;11	In October , Takashi Hiraoka , the mayor of Hiroshima sent a letter , to Vice President Al Gore contending that a U.S. Senate resolution seeking changes to a war exhibit in Washington next year was tantamount to condoning the 1945 atomic bombing of his city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;12	The exhibit , which will feature the first public display of the Enola Gay , the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima , is planned for May 1995 at Washington 's Smithsonian Institution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;13	The Smithsonian agreed to revise the script earlier this year after veterans groups said it was too sympathetic to wartime Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0005;14	They also said it was unjustly critical of the use of a device that may have saved thousands of lives by making a bloody invasion of the Japanese home islands unnecessary and hastening the end the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;0	Chinese import and export of high-technology products reached a record level in 1993 at dlrs 20.59 billion , up 40 percent from 1992 , according to figures released Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;1	The statistics were the first ever China has released on its high-tech trade volume , said the Economic Information Daily .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;2	The State Science and Technology Commission released the statistics in the official Chinese-language paper .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;3	Computers , telecommunications equipment and similar products accounted for 10.5 percent of the country 's entire 1993 commodity trade volume of dlrs 195.7 billion , it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;4	High-tech imports were up to dlrs 15.91 billion in 1993 , and exports rose to dlrs 4.68 billion , leaving a trade deficit of dlrs 11.23 billion , the newspaper said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;5	Exports of high-tech products increased by dlrs 680 million , or 17 percent , in 1993 , while imports jumped by dlrs 5.2 billion , or 48.5 percent , during the same year , the newspaper said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;6	The 1993 deficit widened from dlrs 10.71 billion a year earlier and was a big factor in China 's overall commodity trade deficit of dlrs 12.19 billion in 1993 , it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0007;7	Computers and telecommunications equipment accounted for nearly 54 percent of all Chinese-made high-tech exports during the past year , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0008;0	Lester Ellis of Australia will face a new opponent in Filipino Al Coquilla when he fights for the vacant International Boxing Organization junior-welterweight title in Kalgoorlie on Saturday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0008;1	Coquilla replaces his compatriot Noel Toledo , who originally was earmarked to fight Ellis for the lightly-regarded IBO title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0008;2	Ellis , 29 , is the former IBF junior-lightweight and WBF welterweight champion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0008;3	He has a 37-6 professional record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0008;4	Promoter Bill Hartmann said Coquilla claims a record of 30-5-2 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;0	After months of hot debate , Beijing has passed a law meant to discourage raising dogs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;1	Under the new law , dog owners must pay a 5,000-yuan -LRB- dlrs 600 -RRB- dog registration fee -- or 3,000 yuan -LRB- dlrs 360 -RRB- if the dog is registered within three months of when the law goes into effect on May 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;2	Annual renewal fees will be 2,000 yuan -LRB- dlrs 240 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;3	That compares with the average annual income of about 6,000 to 9,000 yuan -LRB- about dlrs 725 to 1,100 -RRB- of Beijing workers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;4	The new law , passed on Wednesday , allows only one dog per family and bans `` large and fierce dogs , '' the Beijing Daily reported Thursday in its top front-page story .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;5	It did not say what breeds would be banned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;6	News reports said small dogs will only be allowed outdoors between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. , and bigger ones can never go out at all .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;7	Every dog will be banned from public areas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;8	Beijing newspapers and radio phone-in shows have carried both sides of a debate on whether and how to restrict dogs in the city and its suburbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;9	The proposed law put the registration fee at 6,000 yuan -LRB- dlrs 700 -RRB- , and many people complained it was too high .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;10	The Beijing area has about 190,000 dogs , compared with 20,000 in 1986 , the Xinhua News Agency said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;11	It was not immediately clear how the city would enforce the new law .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;12	Xinhua quoted Zhang Liangji of the Public Security Bureau as saying 52,000 residents were bitten by dogs last year , and 89 people died of rabies from 1988 to 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;13	Dog-owning was considered decadent in China before the current economic reforms took hold over the past decade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0009;14	Xinhua noted on Wednesday that China has 120 million dogs who eat 15 billion kilograms -LRB- 33 billion pounds -RRB- of grain , enough to feed 40 million people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;0	China 's foreign exchange reserves increased 106 percent in the first 10 months of the year , reaching dlrs 43.7 billion , the China Daily reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;1	The foreign debt , meanwhile , is expected to top dlrs 100 billion by the end of the year , said Guan Tao of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;2	China 's foreign debt surpassed dlrs 90 billion at the end of August , compared with dlrs 83.6 billion dlrs at the end of last year , the China Daily said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;3	Lin Zeti , deputy director of the administration , said the growing reserves show that China 's foreign exchange system reform has been working well , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;4	With the country 's market economy taking shape , China will maintain a good balance of payments for the next few years , Lin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;5	Guan attributed the fast growth of the foreign exchange reserves to the new foreign exchange system under which all institutions in China are required to sell their foreign exchange to banks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;6	Burgeoning exports , stimulated by the deprecation of the yuan at the start of this year , also brought more foreign exchange into the country , the report added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0010;7	In addition , foreign direct investment in the first nine months of this year has reached dlrs 22.7 billion , up 49 percent from the same period a year earlier , Guan said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;0	Parliament has enacted more power and independence to the Election Commission , but the effort to guarantee fair voting failed to satisfy the opposition or to end Bangladesh 's nine-month political crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;1	The law , passed unanimously late Wednesday , provides for voter identity cards and gives the Election Commission authority to punish officials involved in malpractice .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;2	It empowers the commission to stop voting at any polling station if it suspects `` coercion , intimidation and pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;3	The legislation was rejected by the opposition , which has boycotted Parliament since March 2 , accusing Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 's government of election fraud , corruption and mismanagement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;4	Law Minister Mirza Golam Hafiz , concluding a brief debate on the bill , said `` it will help ensure free , fair and impartial voting , check false voting , and effectively protect the rights of the voters . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;5	But opposition spokesman Mohammad Nasim said the bill `` is nowhere close to our demand for free and fair polls under an interim government . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;6	The opposition wants the government to step down three months before elections , yielding to a neutral caretaker government that would supervise voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;7	Mrs. Zia rejects the demand as `` unjustified and unconstitutional , '' but has offered to bring opposition members into a pre-election Cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;8	The next election is scheduled for 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;9	After an international mediation effort failed last month to break the deadlock , opposition leader Sheikh Hasina called for an accelerated campaign of national strikes and demonstrations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;10	On Tuesday , a strike backed by a rail and road blockade choked off routine business in the capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;11	Hasina has called for a 48-hour general strike next week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0011;12	Businessmen have complained that the prolonged deadlock is hurting exports , discouraging foreign investment and diverting the government 's attention from its program of deregulating the economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0012;0	The U.S. dollar closed at 99.01 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market Thursday , up 0.03 yen from Wednesday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher is telling the NATO allies the Clinton administration has swung to their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;1	It is the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans led by France prevailed over the United States in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;2	It is a difficult assignment for Christopher , putting him in the awkward position of shifting gears even while denying U.S. policy on the war has changed or that there is a trans-Atlantic rift .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;3	National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , in a speech Wednesday at Princeton University , acknowledged it is a path `` rife with frustrations and setbacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;4	Nonetheless , he said , `` it 's the best , the steadiest course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;5	... Both sides face the same choice : They can perpetuate a bloody military stalemate or they can stop the senseless killing and come to terms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;6	By chance , it is the U.S. turn to preside over a meeting today of the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's policy-making arm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;7	This puts Christopher under an even brighter spotlight , and he was responding both with a brief speech opening the session and a detailed one outlining the revised U.S. approach to the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;8	It is centered on a call for an international peace conference that would give the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity to demand changes in the peace plan they have rejected repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;9	They already have strong intimations of support from the Clinton administration in pressing for cross-border political ties to the Serb-dominated government in Belgrade -- a big step toward their goal of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;10	And even the peace plan map the Bosnian Serbs rejected is open to negotiations , Clinton administration officials promised in this week of candid admissions by Defense Secretary William Perry and other senior U.S. officials that the Bosnian Serbs can not be stopped in their territorial conquests by military force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;11	The European allies , particularly France and Britain , have taken this position throughout the 31-month war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;12	They managed to limit NATO air strikes despite U.N. assurances that Bihac , the mostly Muslim town on the verge of falling to the Serbs , was a `` safe area '' from which heavy weapons were to be excluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;13	They also hemmed in the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;14	Lake , in his speech at Princeton , stressed that NATO had chosen not to intervene directly in Bosnia and had given the lead to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;15	`` Right or wrong , that decision has consequences with which we must continue to struggle , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;16	Before leaving Washington , Christopher grumbled to reporters about NATO 's refusal to engage in a sustained bombardment of Serb positions in the northwestern region of the bloodied country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;17	But having threatened the Serbs in the past with NATO might , he abandoned the threat when asked what `` sticks '' the United States was using to persuade the Serbs to relinquish their grip on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;18	If they kept fighting , Christopher said , they risked Serbia closing its border and a tightening of sanctions -- measures that are far less threatening than attacks by NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;19	Serbia has been the principal arms supplier to Serbs in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;20	And while Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has promised to cut them off , a senior U.S. official said there was considerable `` leakage '' and arms were getting through .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;21	Seeking to limit the damage to the alliance , which successfully stood up to the Soviet Union but has caved on Bosnia , Christopher said he wanted to stress that `` the crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia ; it 's not about NATO and its future . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;22	But NATO 's impotence has raised questions about NATO 's future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;23	Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested after meeting in Brussels with alliance officials that the alliance may have become irrelevant .
APW_ENG_19941201.0014;24	`` There 's been no pressure on the Serbs and until there 's some leverage , it 's going to be very difficult to stop the fighting and reach some kind of settlement , '' Dole said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;0	The 76-year-old schoolteacher carries her anger and disenchantment in her waistcoat pocket , in a little blue booklet and a shiny plastic card tucked among its well-worn pages .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;1	Fan Ximei received the booklet in 1958 , when she joined Taiwan 's ruling Nationalist Party , firmly believing in its doctrine of reunifying Taiwan with the Chinese motherland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;2	She got the plastic card from the New Party , to which she deserted 13 months ago , feeling that the Nationalists had betrayed her most cherished beliefs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;3	The New Party split from the Nationalists last year to uphold the doctrine of reunification .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;4	On Saturday it faces its first major test in local elections that present the Nationalists with their sternest political challenge since they fled to Taiwan from Communist China in 1949 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;5	The polls for governor and mayors of Taiwan 's two largest cities are part of a shift toward democracy initiated by the Nationalists in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;6	Never before have Taiwanese elected their governor , and mayors have n't been elected in Taipei since 1967 and in Kaohsiung since 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;7	The feverish campaigning testifies to the enthusiasm with which Taiwanese have grasped democracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;8	Taipei 's streets are awash with banners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;9	Callers wanting to discuss election issues besiege radio phone-in shows .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;10	Campaigners roam the streets banging cymbals and drums , and gesturing `` V '' for victory to passersby .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;11	At election rallies , ordinary Taiwanese practically line up to discuss election issues with foreign reporters -- a far cry from the pre-1987 years of martial law , when Taiwanese were afraid to discuss politics even among themselves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;12	The New Party , which claims 50,000 members , is the smallest of Taiwan 's three major parties and is not considered a frontrunner in Saturday 's polls .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;13	But it could still play a crucial role by splitting the Nationalist vote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;14	That could open the door for a force people like Fan do n't want in power -- the Democratic Progressive Party , which wants to dump the constitutional tie with China and make Taiwan independent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;15	In Taipei , where its supporters are concentrated , the New Party 's Jaw Shau-kong could draw enough votes from Nationalist incumbent Huang Ta-chou and hand a historic victory to the DPP 's Chen Shui-bian .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;16	But despite that scenario , people like Fan say they can no longer support the Nationalists with a clear conscience .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;17	`` We are disgusted with everything Lee has done , '' said Fan , fixing her listener with jet-black eyes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;18	`` We are the only real Nationalists . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;19	She was referring to Lee Teng-hui , who took power in 1988 as the island 's first Taiwanese-born president and is credited with steering Taiwan peacefully from virtual dictatorship to democracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;20	But for New Party supporters , Lee has betrayed Nationalist principles , particularly the dream of reunification .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;21	They fear that despite his denials , the secretly wants an independent Taiwan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;22	Others said they were sickened by the allegations of Nationalist corruption and vote-buying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;23	Some also blamed both the Nationalists and the DPP for the excesses that have accompanied democracy , such as campaign violence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;24	`` Taiwanese democracy has developed too fast , '' said Lo Feng-hsiang , a medicine importer who was among several thousand New Party supporters at a rally in central Taipei Tuesday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;25	`` We need some peace . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;26	Many of those at the rally were worried about whether the Nationalists are veering toward declaring Taiwan 's independence -- a move Beijing says would provoke war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;27	`` I love the Nationalist Party , but it ignores our wishes , '' said a man who gave his surname as Huang .
APW_ENG_19941201.0016;28	He was switching his support to the New Party after 50 years as a Nationalist , he said , adding : `` We ca n't run away from reunification with the mainland . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;0	Dino Radja scored 26 points and the Boston Celtics survived a late 3-point barrage by Detroit as they got above .500 for the first time this season with a 118-115 win Wednesday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;1	The Pistons made five 3-pointers in 1:07 to close a 110-100 deficit to 116-115 with six seconds remaining .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;2	Dominique Wilkins then made two free throws for Boston with five seconds to go .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;3	The Celtics , who never trailed , got a season-high 21 points from Rick Fox , 18 while Radja had 12 rebounds .

APW_ENG_19941201.0017;10	Johnson narrowly missed posting the Hornets ' first triple-double of the season , getting 10 rebounds and nine assists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;11	After starting the season 0-3 , the Hornets have won three consecutive games and seven of their past 10 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;12	Kevin Willis and Harold Miner led the Heat with 14 apiece .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;13	CLEVELAND -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Danny Ferry scored 7 quick points off the bench during a demoralizing 11-0 run in the second quarter as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the weary Los Angeles Lakers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;14	The loss , one of the most lopsided in Lakers history , stopped their five-game winning streak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;15	Seven Cavaliers scored in double figures , led by Mark Price , Terrell Brandon and Tony Campbell with 16 each .
APW_ENG_19941201.0017;16	Vlade Divac had 14 for the Lakers .

APW_ENG_19941201.0018;0	Botswana and South Korea pledged closer economic and political ties Thursday at a summit meeting in Seoul .
APW_ENG_19941201.0018;1	Botswana President Ketumile Masire said he hoped his visit would help form greater economic cooperation , the presidential office said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0018;2	South Korea 's Kim Young-sam welcomed Masire , and explained Seoul 's continuing efforts to bring rival North Korea 's nuclear program under international guidelines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0018;3	The Communist North is suspected of making nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0018;4	Masire , who arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit , is to meet heads of leading conglomerates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0018;5	He is the first president to visit since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1968 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0020;1	The Longterm Credit Bank of Japan says Minami Corp. owes it more than $ 30 million , and has been in default of its loan for over two years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;2	The bank wants to foreclose on the golf course in hopes of forcing the company to sell the course , a bank attorney said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;3	There are no plans to close the golf course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;4	HONOLULU -LRB- AP -RRB- -- A group of Hawaii businessmen are planning to open the first Subway sandwich store in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;5	A Subway store is set to open in the Russian city of St. Petersburg on Dec. 7 , according to John Finney , who heads the local business group that owns exclusive rights to Subway franchises in Russia and the Baltic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;6	If the store is successful , as many as 25 to 30 more could be opened in St. Petersburg and as many as 200 in Russia by 2005 , Finney said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;7	Finney and his Nevada-based East West Invest Limited Partnership have been working for three years to open a store in Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;8	`` This thing has been unbelievably expensive and frustrating , '' Finney said Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0020;9	`` We have no clue as to how we 're going to do it . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;0	A threat by Bosnian Serbs to shell a Canadian peacekeeping camp near Sarajevo did not materialize Wednesday , but Canadians kept a wary eye on Serb army movements .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;1	The Serbs threatened Monday to shell the camp in Visoko within 48 hours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;2	By dusk Wednesday , when no attack came , a cautious sense of relief spread through camp .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;3	Troops had been on high alert , filling sandbags , posting more lookouts and wearing flak jackets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;4	`` It 's still seen as a possibility but getting more remote by the day , '' said Capt. Tom Newton , a camp spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;5	`` There 's little reported activity in the camp area . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;6	On Sunday , a Serb rocket attack caused minor damage to a building .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;7	`` People are uncomfortable with the whole idea of shelling , obviously , but they get used to the idea and get on with their job , '' said Newton , 30 , a native of Victoria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;8	Canadians monitor Serb army movements by several means , including radio reports from 55 Canadians detained for more than a week by Serbs at various locations near Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;9	Meanwhile , Prime Minister Jean Chretien expressed frustration in an interview with Paris daily Le Monde , saying : `` The peacekeepers in Bosnia have become a sort of armed Red Cross , in a badly defined role .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;10	`` To be in Bosnia is difficult for us .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;11	It 's a European problem , and we are North Americans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;12	The Americans want to control everything and fight down to the last Canadian and Frenchman . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;13	In Ottawa , Defense Minister David Collenette said it 's `` a shame and a disgrace '' that Canada is not in the five-country Contact Group trying to negotiate peace in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;14	He suggested Chretien will raise the matter in Budapest this weekend at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;15	Canada has one of the biggest UN contingents in the region -- 800 troops in Bosnia and 1,200 in Croatia -- while Contact Group members Germany and the United States have none there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;16	Things went badly Wednesday for UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who went to Sarajevo to work for a ceasefire and try to persuade Serbs to stop detaining more than 400 UN troops as insurance against NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;17	Serb leaders refused to meet him and he was jeered by Sarajevo residents while visiting the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;18	An orange alert at the Canadian camp at Visoko was being observed Wednesday and was to stay during the night , requiring personnel to wear flak jackets outside and cancel non-essential trips outside camp .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;19	The camp went to the highest level -- red -- Monday night , forcing personnel to sleep in bunkers and sea containers in two camp buildings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;20	About 400 Canadians stay in the camp at night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;21	Since Monday , 100 non-essential personnel have slept in nearby Kiseljak , returning to the camp during the day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;22	Maj. Dean Milner , senior officer among Canadian detainees , makes daily contact with his soldiers and Serb commanders , said camp spokesman Newton .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;23	`` Everything has been pretty cordial so far and they 've been treated fairly , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0023;24	`` Everybody in camp just wants to give a call home and let everybody know they 're OK . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;0	After nearly half a century , South Korea on Thursday regained peacetime control over its armed forces from the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;1	The turnover was part of an effort to lower the profile of the U.S. military and push South Korea toward self-reliance in defending itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;2	`` I am here to express my happiness that we have earned back the right to control our own forces today , '' Gen. Lee Yang-ho , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said at an elaborate ceremony marking the change .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;3	Dozens of honor guards , some dressed in black and white traditional Korean costumes and others in brightly colored red and blue uniforms with gold braid , saluted Lee as a brass band played .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;4	Earlier Thursday , Lee received the `` baton of command '' from President Kim Young-sam , the head of the armed forces , at the presidential palace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;5	Shortly after the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 , South Korea turned over the command of its military to U.N. forces , headed by the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;6	Thursday 's transfer also has symbolic significance in South Korea 's continuing standoff against North Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;7	The Communist North considers the South a `` puppet regime '' controlled by the United States , and has pointed to Seoul 's lack of command over its own armed forces as evidence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;8	The North has repeatedly used the argument to snub the South and refuse talks on improving relations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;9	The two Koreas never signed a peace treaty after their three-year war , and still have nearly 2 million troops along their border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;10	Thursday 's ceremony followed Wednesday 's signing of a note of exchange to complete the transfer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;11	Under the agreement , the U.S. side reassumes command in times of crisis or war , and still controls certain functions even in peacetime , such as the early-warning system and joint military exercises .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;12	Some 35,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0024;13	About 1 million American soldiers fought in the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;0	The U.S. dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen Thursday , while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined following three days of gains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;1	The dollar closed at 99.03 , up 0.03 yen from Wednesday 's finish in Tokyo and also above its overnight closing of 98.93 yen in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;2	`` Investors wo n't make any big moves ahead of the release Friday of U.S. employment data for November , '' said Toshihiko Tabuchi , a trader at Sakura Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;3	Meanwhile , Japanese exporters selling the dollar above 99.00 yen kept the U.S. currency from rising higher , Tabuchi said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;4	On the stock market , the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 62.02 yen , or 0.33 percent , closing at 19,013.60 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;5	On Wednesday , the average had gained 149.13 points , or 0.79 percent , to 19,075.62 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;6	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was down 1.21 points , or 0.08 percent , to 1,519.20 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;7	It had gained 17.59 points , or 1.17 percent , to 1,520.41 on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;8	After opening lower on profit-taking , share prices recuperated in midday trading on bargain-hunting , but fell back in the afternoon session due to persistent arbitrage-linked sales , dealers said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;9	As of 4 p.m. -LRB- 0700 GMT -RRB- , the price of the benchmark No. 164 10-year Japanese government bonds stood at 96.53 yen , up 0.18 yen from Wednesday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941201.0025;10	Their yield fell to 4.645 percent from 4.675 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;0	Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's personal popularity and the strength of his Congress Party was being tested in an election Thursday in his home state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;1	Voting for state legislatures in two south Indian states was seen as an important bellwether for Congress , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;2	A loss in his own state of Andhra Pradesh could unleash rivalries in the governing party that Rao suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;3	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for elections in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;4	The voting is staggered to allow police forces to move from one to another to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;5	The Andhra Pradesh campaign was marred by violence from left-wing militants , the Peoples War Group , that claims to fight for peasants ' rights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;6	Land mines set by the militants killed at least 29 people in the last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;7	The Congress campaign in Andhra Pradesh was thrown into disarray by the promise of an aging film star-turned-politician , N.T. Rama Rao , to sell rice to the poor at two rupees per kilogram -LRB- three cents per pound -RRB- -- six times less than the market rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;8	Pursuing free market reforms , Rao could offer no subsidies to match his opponent 's challenge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;9	Rama Rao , 72 , who built a popular image by playing Hindu deities in classic films in the local Telugu language , campaigned with the help of his young crowd-pulling wife , whom he married last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0026;10	The prime minister put his own prestige at stake by campaigning hard in his state , but his party 's prospects were hurt by infighting among the local politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;0	Unfazed by the prospect of a complete withdrawal of all U.N. peacekeepers , Bosnia 's rebel Serbs refused even to meet with the U.N. chief to discuss a nationwide cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;1	U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said it may be time to send U.N. troops home after his six-hour mission to Sarajevo on Wednesday failed to move the two sides toward peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;2	The threat reflects a growing frustration as the Serbs continue their assaults and the Muslim-led government refuses new concessions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;3	U.N. peacekeepers are being held hostage and the West is divided about how to respond .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;4	Boutros-Ghali said Wednesday he will not recommend a pullout `` for the time being . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;5	But he said `` it will become impossible '' to sustain support for the peacekeepers in the Security Council unless the Serbs and the government agree to talk peace and cooperate with the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;6	In New York , French U.N. Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee said `` there is no question '' of a withdrawal now , `` but if the situation continues to deteriorate , it will be more difficult to keep the troops there . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;7	A withdrawal by peacekeepers would likely lead to more fighting and could be dangerous for the departing troops , as both Bosnian Serbs and government forces rush U.N. camps to seize equipment before it can be destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;8	It also would cause widespread hardship , Boutros-Ghali said , because the United Nations feeds an estimated 3 million people across the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;9	Most are in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;10	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the 2 -LCB- - year conflict launched by Serbs after Bosnia 's Muslim-Croat majority voted to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;11	Tens of thousands more have been forced to flee their homes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;12	Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their war-won land holdings to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;13	On Wednesday , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only if Serbs accept the peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;14	He said they have proposed a three-month cease-fire , but the Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;15	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused even to meet Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;16	The Bosnian Serbs would n't mind seeing the United Nations leave Bosnia , believing it would allow them to force the government to settle on Serb terms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;17	Boutros-Ghali 's visit followed admissions from top U.S. and NATO officials that they ca n't force a solution to the conflict without a huge ground force no one is willing to provide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;18	The impact of airstrikes is questionable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;19	NATO struck three times last week on Serb positions near the U.N.-designated `` safe area '' of Bihac in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;20	The action only prompted the Serbs to take more than 400 U.N. soldiers hostage as insurance against more bombing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;21	NATO members provide two-thirds of the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;22	Forty-five Britons were released Wednesday , but some Canadian , French , Russian and Ukrainian peacekeepers have been held now for a week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;23	More than 100 Dutch troops have been hostage since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;24	U.N. sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity , reported `` intense bombardment '' around Bihac on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0027;25	Some 70,000 mostly Muslim civilians are trapped in the government-held town , which is supposed to be under U.N. protection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0028;0	Four Indian Tamils have been jailed for traveling on fake Bangladesh passports , police said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0028;1	Their interrogation so far has not established any links with the Tamil movement for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka , a top police official said on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0028;2	Police arrested them on Nov. 18 at Dhaka International airport when they arrived from Singapore .
APW_ENG_19941201.0028;3	The Tamils , in their thirties , claimed to have bought the passports for dlrs 700 each in Singapore and faked the names of Bangladesh citizens after they lost their Indian passports , police said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0028;4	Hundreds of thousands of Tamils of Indian origin live in Sri Lanka , Malaysia and Singapore .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;0	The Duchess of York stayed too long at the ball and decided to sleep in , arriving late Thursday in Melbourne and disappointing health professionals who had gathered to meet her .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;1	The Duchess is on a three-day visit to Australia as worldwide patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association -LRB- MNDA -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;2	MNDA is a fatal nerve disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;3	She arrived for her brief visit two hours late because she was tired after her schedule in Sydney on Wednesday , which included a ball Wednesday night , organizers said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;4	Her late arrival forced the cancellation of a meeting with 40 health professionals representing the Victorian MNDA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;5	`` The Duchess was very tired after her activities in Sydney because there was a ball there last night , so I think that she decided to delay her trip out of Sydney so she could have a little longer rest , '' event coordinator Maxine Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;6	`` We are very disappointed because we 've got nearly 300 people here who are very excited about her visit , '' she said ,
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;7	The Duchess -- Sarah Ferguson before her marriage to Britain 's Prince Andrew -- made a presentation to the MNDA at a function Thursday afternoon and met sufferers of the disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;8	The Duchess said it was important to remember that sufferers , although physically affected , were not mentally disabled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;9	She recalled the death of a close friend from the disease nine years ago , saying they had continued to write a book together right up to his death .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;10	`` It showed me , the day he passed away , his brain was as good as any working day , and I thought I would hate to get this disease , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0029;11	She was scheduled to leave for London later Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;0	Australia donated dlrs 213,332 -LRB- 280,000 Australian dollars -RRB- Thursday for studies to help the Philippines plan its strategy against AIDS , while a workers ' group denounced government health policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;1	The Philippine government is putting another dlrs 116,570 into the study , health undersecretary Jaime Tan said in signing ceremonies that coincided with World AIDS Day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;2	After the signing , Tan led AIDS Day celebrations on the department grounds featuring papier-mache giants , red balloons , fireworks , two marching bands and a condom-shaped mascot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;3	Meanwhile , the Alliance of Health Workers , a national association representing government workers , criticized the celebrations as an example of the health department 's `` excessive , unnecessary and extravagant '' program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;4	Nilo Capangpangan , the alliance 's national vice president , said at a news conference that health workers in the provinces are being affected by erroneous policies , including a 1991 transfer of supervision of health workers to local officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;5	`` We can not guarantee to provide better health service because under the present setup -LRB- we are -RRB- at the mercy of the powerful mayors and governors , '' Capangpangan added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;6	He said the policy also opened the health budget to corruption because local officials now sign for the acquisition of supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;7	Philippine health officials estimate that for every Filipino identified as carrying the AIDS virus , nine others remain unreported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;8	Since 1984 , the Philippines has identified 565 Filipinos as virus carriers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0030;9	Of those , 171 have developed AIDS and 96 have died of the disease , which attacks the body 's immune system .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;0	Australian rice is best suited for making Japan 's sweet-flavored bean paste , a private food research institute said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;1	The Central Miso Research Institute said bean paste made of Australian rice placed first among 26 entries in the sweet-flavored category in the institute 's annual miso contest last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;2	Miso , or bean paste , is made by mixing steamed soybeans or rice with salt and a fermenting agent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;3	Miso , together with soy sauce , is the basic flavoring of Japanese cuisine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;4	`` We hope this result of the contest is n't misunderstood to question the quality of Australian rice , '' said Mitsuyuki Mori , a director of the Tokyo-based institute for 1,700 miso manufacturers across the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;5	`` We came to know last year that Australian rice is as good as Japanese rice in cooking , '' Mori said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;6	`` Also , only good rice can make good miso . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;7	Last fall , Japan suffered its worst rice harvest since World War II and the government allowed imports of foreign-grown rice for the first time in many decades to make up a shortage of more than 2 million tons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;8	For their dinner tables , however , most Japanese tried to obtain domestic rather than foreign rice .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;9	In the sweet-flavored category , Japanese rice placed second and third and Thai rice fourth , followed by Chinese rice , Mori said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0041;10	Makers normally use rice for sweet miso and soybeans for salty miso .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;0	Under a furious lobbying barrage from the Clinton administration and corporate executives , the U.S. Senate seemed headed toward approving a new world trade agreement in a vote Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;1	Senior administration officials were guarding their vote counts , but Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared `` momentum is swinging our way '' and a smiling U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor assured reporters , `` We 're in very good shape . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;2	Senate approval was the last legislative hurdle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;3	The House of Representatives endorsed the accord , negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , by a 288-146 vote Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;4	Thirty-three countries already have ratified the 124-nation accord and , according to Bentsen , the others will act before Jan. 1 if the United States backs it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;5	For that to happen , 60 of the 100 senators must vote to override a parliamentary objection lodged by Sen. Robert Byrd .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;6	According to an Associated Press survey , GATT proponents appeared to have achieved that number , when counting those who were leaning in favor but not firmly committed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;7	President Clinton hoped to widen the still-thin victory margin at a breakfast meeting Thursday with 20 lawmakers , including a late and crucial supporter , Senate Republican leader Bob Dole .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;8	Opponents ' only hope was to muster 41 votes in favor of the procedural hurdle imposed by Byrd , who charges the accord will increase the U.S. deficit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;9	Under Senate rules , the legislation approving GATT must offset all of the projected dlrs 43 billion in lost tariff revenues over the first decade of the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;10	To make up for the lost tariffs , the administration is cutting farm subsidies and raising revenue with a number of measures , including changing the minimum rate on savings bonds and auctioning licenses for a new generation of wireless broadcast services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;11	But Byrd said the bill falls dlrs 14.5 billion short and some senators said they would not vote to bust the U.S. budget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;12	The administration counters that the tariff cuts , averaging 38 percent globally , will so stimulate economic growth that federal revenues will rise , not fall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;13	The AP head count had 60 senators for or leaning toward waiving budget rules , 26 against or leaning against and 14 undeclared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;14	Byrd and others also complain that a new Geneva-based World Trade Organization , created to referee trade disputes , will inevitably infringe on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;15	But Dole , who had voiced the same concern , secured a promise from the administration to create an independent panel to review WTO decisions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;16	If U.S. interests were being harmed , the panel could recommend that Congress withdraw from the organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;17	The administration is predicting 500,000 new American jobs as a result of increased U.S. export sales under GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0033;18	In addition to bringing foreign tariffs closer to U.S. levels , it reduces barriers to trade in agricultural goods and services and protects U.S. intellectual property , such as computer programs , from being pirated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;0	South Korea sold a record amount of products overseas in November but still ran a trade deficit of dlrs 292 million for the month , the Trade , Industry , and Energy Ministry said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;1	The November deficit , after a dlrs 88 million surplus in November last year , resulted from a continuing surge of capital goods imports , the ministry said in its monthly report .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;2	Exports of dlrs 9.29 billion broke the previous monthly record of dlrs 8.89 billion , set in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;3	Sales of semiconductors , petrochemical products , ships and automobiles pushed exports up by 26.4 percent from November last year , the ministry said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;4	But imports rose 32.0 percent from a year earlier to dlrs 9.58 billion , with capital goods purchases shooting up because of active corporate investment , the report added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0034;5	November 's trade brought the cumulative deficit for the year 's first 11 months to dlrs 6.30 billion , up from a deficit of dlrs 2.21 billion in January-November last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;0	Champion Yasuei Yakushiji meets interim champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi next week in Japan 's richest boxing match -- a World Boxing Council bantamweight unification title bout .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;1	The two Japanese fighters each are to receive dlrs 1.7 million for the 12-round fight Sunday at Nagoya Municipal Gymnasium in central Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;2	On Thursday , both were declared fit after prefight physical examinations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;3	Yakushiji is making his third defense of the title he won from Byun Jung-il of South Korea last December .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;4	For former WBC champion Tatsuyoshi , it will be the first bout in Japan since his recovery from a detached retina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;5	The Japan Boxing Commission forced Tatsuyoshi to retire in September last year after the detached retina was discovered following his 12-round victory over Victor Rabanales of Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;6	But Tatsuyoshi then went overseas to fight and beat WBC ranking contender Josefino Suarez of Mexico in Honolulu in July to regain the WBC interim bantamweight crown .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;7	At the physical examinations , doctors said Tatsuyoshi showed no sign of any trouble with his sight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;8	Tatsuyoshi has a seven-centimeter -LRB- 2.8-inch -RRB- reach advantage while Yakushiji is 8.6 centimeters -LRB- 3.4 inches -RRB- taller .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;9	The 26-year-old Yakushiji has a record of 22 victories , 16 of them by knockout , against two defeats and one draw .
APW_ENG_19941201.0037;10	Tatsuyoshi , 24 , has won 10 matches -- eight by knockout -- lost one and drawn one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;0	Fire continued to burn inside the Achille Lauro Thursday , a day after the flames forced the nearly 1,000 people aboard take to lifeboats and abandon the cruise ship off Somalia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;1	Two people were reported dead and one missing in the flight from the Achille Lauro , which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;2	U.S. Navy personnel and commercial ship captains taking part in the rescue said the Achille Lauro was listing but in no danger of sinking Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;3	`` She is presently listing at about 20 degrees .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;4	There 's a tremendous amount of smoke and steam still coming from over three quarters of the length of the vessel , '' John Briand , captain of the oil tanker Lima , told the BBC .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;5	The fire started Wednesday , apparently in the passenger area , but the cause was not known , said the ship 's owner , Starlauro of Genoa , Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;6	Eight people were injured in the fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;7	About 60 crewmembers fought the fire before abandoning the 23,478-ton ship 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- south of the Horn of Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;8	An official with the U.N. mission in Somalia put the ship 's position at about 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- off the small Somali fishing village of Eil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;9	Capt. Ferdinando Lolli , a port official in Rome , said the ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;10	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch and British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;11	Late Wednesday evening , Italian Coast Guard officials reported that one person from the Achille Lauro was still unaccounted for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;12	Italian news agencies identified the dead as a Briton and a German .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;13	The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian King was one of the first ships to arrive at the scene and took on about 800 people , said a coast guard official in Rome , Adm. Eugenio Sicurezza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;14	Many had to spend the night on the Hawaiian King 's deck , Briand said , and other ships sent over food , blankets and toiletries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;15	Two U.S. warships , the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton , arrived overnight and dispatched helicopters to ferry water , food and medical supplies to the survivors , said Cmdr. T. McCreary , spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command in the Gulf .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;16	`` Quite a few people were injured in the transfer -- there 's a few broken bones and some pretty tortured souls , '' Briand said , adding that many of the rescued passengers were elderly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;17	The commerical and Navy ships will divide up the passengers Thursday and send them on , mostly to Mombasa , Kenya , and Djibouti , McCreary said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;18	Others reportedly will be taken to the Seychelles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;19	Briand said the transfer was expected to take most of the day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;20	His ship was taking on the Achille Lauro 's 50 Honduran crewmembers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;21	The Achille Lauro left Genoa on Nov. 19 , stopped in Israel , and its next port of call was to be Durban , South Africa , on Friday , said Carla Gotta , a spokeswoman for the cruise ship 's owner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;22	The terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985 shot American Leon Klinghoffer and pushed him in his wheelchair off the ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;23	The hijackers escaped the vessel and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;24	Launched in 1946 in the Netherlands , the Achille Lauro was acquired 20 years later by the Neapolitan shipping dynasty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;25	It first transported Italian immigrant workers to and from Australia and was outfitted for pleasure cruises in 1970 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;26	The liner rammed a fishing boat in 1971 off Italy , killing a Neapolitan fisherman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;27	And on Dec. 2 , 1981 , fire broke out aboard ship off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0038;28	Panicked passengers jumped into the sea , and two of them drowned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;0	In 10 years , a trip to a music store may involve sticking a card filled with computer memory chips into a vending machine , and downloading the latest hits into it , Japan 's NEC Corp. says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;1	NEC announced Thursday that it has developed a Walkman-like pocket stereo that uses such memory cards instead of tapes to store music .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;2	The interchangeable cards are the size of fat credit cards , and contain rows of tiny computer memory chips .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;3	Each card can currently hold up to 24 minutes of high-quality music , the company says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;4	But NEC says it will wait to commercialize the product .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;5	The reason : the `` flash '' memory chips used in the cards are still so expensive that 24 minutes ' worth , or 32 megabytes , currently costs about dlrs 2,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;6	Prices of the chips are expected to drop , however , and NEC predicts that 90 minutes of capacity will be priced at about dlrs 100 in the year 2000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;7	The rest of the player will cost only about dlrs 50 to make , and the circuitry eventually could be incorporated into the memory card itself , resulting in a card-size player , NEC spokesman Mark Pearce said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;8	Since the music is stored digitally in memory chips , the players are lighter than conventional cassettes and do n't have any moving parts to wear out or skip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;9	And unlike tapes , the chips allow instant random access to different music tracks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;10	The cards also could be used to store other kinds of information , including text , still pictures and moving images .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;11	NEC is considering a version that could also function as a debit card , with each music purchase subtracted automatically from the total credit on the card , Pearce said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;12	The player , which NEC calls Silicon Audio , uses a compression method called MPEG to reduce the size of the music data , which otherwise would require eight times as much memory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;13	NEC is Japan 's largest semiconductor maker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;14	It announced earlier this week that it will invest 100 billion yen -LRB- dlrs 1.01 billion -RRB- over the next three years to build the world 's first line for making 256-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;15	Those would hold 16 times as much information as the largest chips now on the market , which are 16 megabit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;16	The new line will also be used to make high-capacity flash memories , the type used by the music player , NEC said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0039;17	Unlike DRAMs , flash memories maintain their data even after the power is turned off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;0	Two Christian zealots were sent to jail Thursday for killing a woman after a ceremony to exorcise demons they claimed were possessing her .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;1	The accused told police that Joan Leonora Vollmer spoke in voices other than her own , that she had enormous strength and that her face sometimes took on the appearance of a dog or a pig .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;2	Under sentences handed down in County Court , Leanne Merlyn Reichenbach , 32 , will serve four months in prison and David Andrew Klingner , 30 , will serve three months for the 1993 manslaughter of Mrs. Vollmer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;3	Two other defendants , Vollmer 's 56-year-old widower , Ralph Vollmer , and Matthew Paul Nuske , 22 , received suspended sentences of 12 and three months , respectively .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;4	Mrs. Vollmer , 49 , died of a heart attack on Jan. 30 , 1993 , at her farm in Antwerp , near Horsham , after a weeklong attempt to rid her of demons , according to court testimony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;5	Her husband , Reichenbach , Klingner and Nuske held her on a chair for four hours in 102-degree Fahrenheit -LRB- 40-degree Celsius -RRB- heat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;6	They prayed over her , slapped her , forced her mouth open and massaged her neck and stomach .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;7	Prosecutors said the stroking of her neck , on the carotid artery , triggered the fatal heart attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0040;8	`` Unrestrained religious enthusiasm can well be , as we have found out here , a crime under our law and people should be made to know that it is , '' Judge Graeme Crossley told the defendants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;0	There are no plans for a World Cup swimming competition in Beijing next month , Chinese sports officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;1	Germany 's swimming federation had announced plans to boycott the World Cup in Beijing and other events in China to protest the country 's doping record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;2	The World Swimming Federation had assigned the dates Jan. 7-8 to Beijing for one stage of the World Cup competitions , held in several different cities each year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;3	But the Chinese Swimming Association said it has been unable to raise funds for the event .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;4	`` We never even sent out any invitations , '' said an official who answered the phone at the association 's offices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;5	Eleven Chinese athletes , seven of them swimmers , recently were found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs at the Asian Games in Japan in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;6	The test results seemed to substantiate allegations made by coaches and athletes from other countries that the phenomenal success of China 's athletes may be due in part to the use of performance-enhancing drugs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;7	Allegations of drug use among Chinese women swimmers escalated at the World Championships in Rome in September when they won 12 of 16 gold medals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;8	The Chinese women won all 15 of their races at the Asian Games , raising further suspicion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;9	Among those reported to have tested positive at the Asian Games were Yang Aihua , who won the women 's 400-meter freestyle at the World Championships , and Lu Bin , who won four gold medals at the Asian Games and set a world record in the women 's 200-meter individual medley .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;10	Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian denied that the positive tests were evidence of regular drug use among Chinese athletes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;11	`` This is an act by individuals , '' he said at a weekly briefing , adding that Chinese sports authorities practice `` strict prohibition , strict testing and strict punishment '' of drug use .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;12	Chen reiterated China 's position that the stunning performance of its athletes was the result of hard , scientific training .
APW_ENG_19941201.0042;13	`` Their performance can not be denied , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0043;0	Gold in Hong Kong dropped the equivalent of 1.82 U.S. dollars an ounce on Thursday , to close at 381.75 U.S. dollars , compared with Wednesday 's 383.57 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0043;1	The U.S. dollar closed Thursday at 7.7335 Hong Kong dollars , compared with Wednesday 's 7.7340 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0045;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher is telling the NATO allies the Clinton administration has swung to their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;1	It is the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans led by France prevailed over the United States in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;2	It is a difficult assignment for Christopher , putting him in the awkward position of shifting gears even while denying U.S. policy on the war has changed or that there is a trans-Atlantic rift .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;3	At breakfast today with Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;4	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;5	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;6	Asked if the troops would be withdrawn , Hurd replied grimly : `` We hope not . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;7	National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , in a speech Wednesday at Princeton University , acknowledged it is a path `` rife with frustrations and setbacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;8	Nonetheless , he said , `` it 's the best , the steadiest course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;9	... Both sides face the same choice : They can perpetuate a bloody military stalemate or they can stop the senseless killing and come to terms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;10	By chance , it is the U.S. turn to preside over a meeting today of the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's policy-making arm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;11	This puts Christopher under an even brighter spotlight , and he was responding both with a brief speech opening the session and a detailed one outlining the revised U.S. approach to the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;12	It is centered on a call for an international peace conference that would give the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity to demand changes in the peace plan they have rejected repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;13	They already have strong intimations of support from the Clinton administration in pressing for cross-border political ties to the Serb-dominated government in Belgrade -- a big step toward their goal of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;14	And even the peace plan map the Bosnian Serbs rejected is open to negotiations , Clinton administration officials promised in this week of candid admissions by Defense Secretary William Perry and other senior U.S. officials that the Bosnian Serbs can not be stopped in their territorial conquests by military force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;15	`` This alliance will continue to be the anchor of American engagement in Europe , the linchpin of Trans-Atlantic security , '' Christopher said in a brief statement opening the North Atlantic Council session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;16	He also assured the 15 foreign ministers that the Clinton administration was committed to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe `` as part of our continuing engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;17	The European allies , particularly France and Britain , have taken this position throughout the 31-month war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;18	They managed to limit NATO air strikes despite U.N. assurances that Bihac , the mostly Muslim town on the verge of falling to the Serbs , was a `` safe area '' from which heavy weapons were to be excluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;19	They also hemmed in the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;20	Lake , in his speech at Princeton , stressed that NATO had chosen not to intervene directly in Bosnia and had given the lead to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;21	`` Right or wrong , that decision has consequences with which we must continue to struggle , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;22	Before leaving Washington , Christopher grumbled to reporters about NATO 's refusal to engage in a sustained bombardment of Serb positions in the northwestern region of the bloodied country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;23	But having threatened the Serbs in the past with NATO might , he abandoned the threat when asked what `` sticks '' the United States was using to persuade the Serbs to relinquish their grip on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;24	If they kept fighting , Christopher said , they risked Serbia closing its border and a tightening of sanctions -- measures that are far less threatening than attacks by NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;25	Serbia has been the principal arms supplier to Serbs in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;26	And while Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has promised to cut them off , a senior U.S. official said there was considerable `` leakage '' and arms were getting through .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;27	Seeking to limit the damage to the alliance , which successfully stood up to the Soviet Union but has caved on Bosnia , Christopher said he wanted to stress that `` the crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia ; it 's not about NATO and its future . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;28	But NATO 's impotence has raised questions about NATO 's future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;29	Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested after meeting in Brussels with alliance officials that the alliance may have become irrelevant .
APW_ENG_19941201.0045;30	`` There 's been no pressure on the Serbs and until there 's some leverage , it 's going to be very difficult to stop the fighting and reach some kind of settlement , '' Dole said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;0	Naomichi Ozaki shot nine birdies Thursday for a course-record 62 that gave him a two-shot first-round lead in the Golf Nippon Series , a showdown among the Japanese tour 's top 24 players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;1	Ozaki , younger brother of Masashi `` Jumbo '' Ozaki , birdied six holes on the front nine and three on the back in a bogey-free , 9-under-par round .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;2	He beat the record of 64 set by Hajime Meshiai in 1989 on the 7,002-yard , par-71 Yomiuri Golf Member Course in western Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;3	Eiji Mizoguchi tied the record , starting with a bogey but recovering with an eagle and six birdies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;4	Ozaki now ranks sixth and Mizoguchi seventh on this season 's Japan PGA money-earnings list .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;5	Tsuneyuki Nakajima , seeking his second straight victory in this tournament , was tied at 68 with American David Ishii -- fifth on the money list -- and two other players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;6	American Brian Watts , who has won five Japan PGA tournaments this season , was in a big group at 71 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;7	Todd Hamilton of the United States , a two-time winner this season , shot a 73 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;8	The 100 million yen -LRB- dlrs 1 million -RRB- tournament is for tour event winners and the top 20 money earners this season , although Jumbo Ozaki , the leading money winner , is taking a rest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0046;9	The winner receives 30 million yen -LRB- dlrs 300,000 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;0	Assault charges against five Aborigines charged with beating a teen-ager and a woman as tribal law punishment should be dropped , the Aboriginal Legal Service said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;1	Five Aborigines from the desert Jigalong community were charged with assault over punishment they inflicted last week on a 14-year-old girl and a 25-year-old woman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;2	Rob Riley , the service 's chief executive officer , said the five acted under the authority of community elders and should not have been charged under European law .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;3	The beatings were linked to the death of an elderly community member after he was hit by a truck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;4	The two women were present when the accident occurred .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;5	Under Aboriginal law , if someone dies of an unnatural cause , another person is generally held responsible for the death and punished accordingly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;6	Both females were severely beaten with crowbars , the girl was speared through the leg and hand and the woman had her arm broken .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;7	A hospital staff member who treated the 14-year-old reported the attack to police .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;8	Riley said the two women faced further punishment as a result of the charges being filed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;9	The police officer who pressed charges , however , disputed Riley 's account .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;10	Det. Phillip Farris said community elders assisted police in laying the charges because the five acted without authority and did not properly inflict the punishment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;11	A mob of about 20 people attacked the girls at the man 's funeral and seven other people were speared during the attack , Farris said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;12	Riley said it was unfair for Australians of European descent to enforce white law on the entire population .
APW_ENG_19941201.0048;13	He noted white Australians were inconsistent in accepting some parts of Aboriginal culture , such as arts , while rejecting others .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;0	Off-spinner Carl Hooper struck twice in a space of four deliveries to restrict India to 74 for the loss of two wickets at lunch on the opening day of the second test on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;1	India lead 1-0 in the three test series .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;2	Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and decided to bat first on a slow wicket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;3	West Indian fast bowlers Courtney Walsh and Kenneth Benjamin posed no problems for Indian openers who scored 35 off 14 overs in the first hour .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;4	Off-spinner Hooper struck as soon as he pressed into the attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;5	Bowling a good line and turning the ball just enough to beat the bat , he dislodged Manoj Prabhakar and Vinod Kambli in quick succession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0049;6	Navjot Siddhu and Sachin Tendulkar were batting 36 and 10 runs respectively at lunch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;0	The U.S. dollar closed at a seven-week high against the Japanese yen Thursday , while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined following three days of gains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;1	The dollar closed at 99.01 , up 0.03 yen from Wednesday 's finish in Tokyo and also above its overnight closing of 98.93 yen in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;2	It was the first time that the dollar had closed above 99.00 yen in Tokyo since Oct. 13 , when it finished at 99.88 yen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;3	After opening at 98.83 yen , the day 's low , the dollar moved up to 99.03 yen at one point in the closing hour .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;4	The dollar has strengthened over the past week in optimism about a stronger U.S. economy with low inflation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;5	`` But investors wo n't make any big moves ahead of the release Friday of U.S. employment data for November , '' said Toshihiko Tabuchi , a trader at Sakura Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;6	Spot trading totaled dlrs 3.630 billion , down from Wednesday 's already sluggish dlrs 4.555 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;7	Meanwhile , Japanese exporters selling the dollar above 99.00 yen kept the U.S. currency from rising higher , Tabuchi said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;8	On the stock market , the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 62.02 yen , or 0.33 percent , closing at 19,013.60 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;9	On Wednesday , the average had gained 149.13 points , or 0.79 percent , to 19,075.62 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;10	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was down 1.21 points , or 0.08 percent , to 1,519.20 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;11	It had gained 17.59 points , or 1.17 percent , to 1,520.41 on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;12	After opening lower on profit-taking , share prices recuperated in midday trading on bargain-hunting , but fell back in the afternoon session due to persistent arbitrage-linked sales , dealers said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;13	An estimated 270 million shares changed hands on the first section , down from 335.21 million Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;14	Declines outnumbered advances 543 to 482 , while 164 issues were unchanged .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;15	The price of the benchmark No. 164 10-year Japanese government bonds closed at 96.47 yen , up 0.12 yen from Wednesday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941201.0051;16	Their yield fell to 4.655 percent from 4.675 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;0	Fighting in the Bihac area of northwestern Bosnia could do more than cause a U.N. withdrawal from Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;1	It could draw Croatia back into war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;2	And that new fighting between Croatia and its rebel Serbs could mushroom into a much broader conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;3	Croatia is chafing that rebel Serbs still control over one-third of its territory , almost three years after a cease-fire ended six months of war between the two sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;4	It holds out the option of taking the territory back by force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;5	Thousands of peacekeepers monitor an uneasy truce in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;6	Bosnia 's Bihac region , surrounded by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs , is the softest spot of Croatia 's vulnerable underbelly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;7	Serb-held territory that borders the Bihac area is less than 15 miles from Zagreb , the Croatian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;8	If Serbs control the area around Bihac , they will be able to cooperate more easily across the border , making it more difficult for Croatia to regain Serb-held territories .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;9	Negotiations between the Serbs and Croats have been stalled , although the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that a Serb assembly today accept an economic agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;10	If accepted , it would be the first accord between the foes since they agreed on a formal cease-fire March 29 , and could help to reduce tensions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;11	Croatian officials say they were ready to intervene in Bihac when rebel Serbs from Croatia crossed the border to fight Bosnia 's Muslim-led army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;12	But the Croat intervention was put off after NATO gave assurances it would prevent the fall of Bihac , said prominent hardliner Vladimir Seks , who is deputy speaker of parliament .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;13	Three NATO airstrikes did nothing to stop the Serbs there , however , and now the United Nations is threatening to pull its peacekeepers out all together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;14	The Croatian parliament is working on a resolution that is expected to endorse intervention , but any decision would have to be made by President Franjo Tudjman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;15	Officials say the fighting in Bihac proves that Croats must look out for their own security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;16	`` If the Croatian army intervenes , it will not be to save Bihac , '' said Fran Visnar , a military analyst in Zagreb , `` but to use the opportunity to regain some of its territories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;17	However , if the Croatian government got involved , the Croatian Serbs would almost certainly get help from the Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;18	And it would be difficult for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to stay out of the conflict , despite his recent efforts to distance himself from his Bosnian Serb bretheren .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;19	The United Nations has slapped sanctions against Serbia for whipping up nationalist Serb sentiment that ignited wars in Croatia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;20	The Bihac fighting could also threaten Bosnia 's Croat-Muslim federation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;21	A U.S.-brokered agreement , signed last March with great fanfare , ended a year of fierce fighting between Muslims and Croats in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0052;22	Some Croats now say there appears to be little point to the federation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0053;0	Unions on Thursday called off a general strike after the government agreed during all night talks to scale down cuts in Italy 's generous pension system .
APW_ENG_19941201.0053;1	Premier Silvio Berlusconi 's spokesman Jas Gawronski said the government and union leaders reached an accord on pension reforms , which are part of the 1995 deficit-fighting budget now being debated in the Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0053;2	The strike , scheduled for Friday , would have been the second general strike in six weeks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0053;3	`` We are talking about a very satisfactory agreement that concludes a complex dispute , '' Giancarlo Fontanelli leader of the UIL union told ANSA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0053;4	Union officials sat down with the premier and cabinet minsters early Thursday morning and worked through the night to arrive at the settlement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;0	Making good on a promise to upgrade relations with Taiwan , the United States is sending Transportation Secretary Federico Pena here Sunday to attend an economic conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;1	Pena is only the second U.S. Cabinet member to visit the island since 1979 , when Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the rival Communist government in Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;2	Carla Hills , the then U.S. trade representative , came in 1992 when Washington lifted a ban on Cabinet member visits in a battle with European and Asian countries for contracts in a massive plan to improve Taiwan 's infrastructure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;3	Welcoming the announcement of Pena 's visit , Foreign Ministry spokesman Rock Leng said Thursday it was `` a step to enhance understanding and pave the way for the development of better relations . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;4	In September , the United States announced a modest relaxation of restrictions on Cabinet-level contact between the two governments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;5	The change came in recognition of Taiwan 's economic might , which has made it the United States ' fifth largest trading partner , and of its rapidly developing democracy and improved human rights record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;6	Pena 's visit was seen likely to provoke protests from China , which regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has sought to keep it in diplomatic isolation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;7	Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government that fled the Chinese mainland in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;8	Two weeks ago , at a meeting in Jakarta , Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned President Clinton that any wavering on Taiwan would be `` an insult to the Chinese people . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;9	Pena , heading a six-member delegation , will attend a U.S.-Taiwan economic meeting during his three-day visit , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;10	The annual conference is the same one that Hills attended in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;11	The officials declined to comment on newspaper reports that he will call on President Lee Teng-hui .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;12	Hills met Lee when she was here .
APW_ENG_19941201.0054;13	Former U.S. President George Bush will address the opening session of the three-day economic meeting on Monday , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;0	China urged Britain Thursday to find ways to meet a U.N. deadline to settle the problem of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong by the end of next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;1	Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian said the United Nations decided in 1989 that Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong should not be settled in the British colony and that the problem should be resolved by the end of 1995 , two years before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;2	However , Hong Kong 's colonial government has said recently that it can not repatriate the 24,000 Vietnamese still in refugee camps in the territory by the deadline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;3	Chen said , `` The British Hong Kong government has the responsibilty to settle this issue by the end of 1995 instead of leaving the burden to the future Hong Kong special administrative region '' under Chinese rule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;4	`` We will seek ways to urge the British side to settle this issue no later than the end of 1995 , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;5	Asked what China would do if Vietnamese refugees remained in Hong Kong in 1997 , Chen said the deadline must be adhered to `` since it 's a decision of the United Nations , and China and Britain are both members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;6	Both countries are committed to this program of action . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0055;7	In response to Hong Kong 's assertion that some of the refugees are ethnic Vietnamese from China , Chen said the Beijing governmment was willing to take back those `` few people '' who are identified as Chinese citizens and who are willing to return to China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;0	Thailand has freed an Australian and a New Zealander serving long sentences for heroin possession after the king granted them pardons , embassy officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;1	King Bhumibol Adulyadej pardoned Harry Yau , 45 , of Sydney , Australia , and Alan Robert King , 40 , of Dunedin , New Zealand , last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;2	No reasons were given for the pardons , granted before his Dec. 5 birthday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;3	Yau , who was arrested in 1986 , had been serving a life sentence commuted to 20 years , said an Australian Embassy spokesman who declined to be named .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;4	Yau already has returned to Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;5	The spokesman said 21 other Australians are serving sentences in Thailand , most of them on drug charges .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;6	King , who was arrested in 1984 , was serving a life sentence commuted to 50 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;7	Three other New Zealanders remain in Thai prisons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0056;8	King is to return home in the coming days , said an official at the New Zealand Embassy , who also requested anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;0	Thailand has freed an Australian and a New Zealander serving long sentences for heroin possession after the king granted them pardons , embassy officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;1	King Bhumibol Adulyadej pardoned Harry Yau , 45 , of Sydney , Australia , and Alan Robert King , 40 , of Dunedin , New Zealand , last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;2	No reasons were given for the pardons , granted before his Dec. 5 birthday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;3	Yau , who was arrested in 1986 , had been serving a life sentence commuted to 20 years , said an Australian Embassy spokesman who declined to be named .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;4	Yau already has returned to Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;5	The spokesman said 21 other Australians are serving sentences in Thailand , most of them on drug charges .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;6	King , who was arrested in 1984 , was serving a life sentence commuted to 50 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;7	Three other New Zealanders remain in Thai prisons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0057;8	King is to return home in the coming days , said an official at the New Zealand Embassy , who also requested anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;0	Police Minister Moshe Shahal recommended Thursday that Israel bar entrance to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza until their self-rule government proved capable of preventing attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;1	Shahal spoke to Israel radio a day after a Palestinian axed a 19-year-old woman soldier to death and two days after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he wanted to begin separating Palestinians and Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;2	Talk of dismantling small , isolated settlements was also growing this week , as Islamic militants opposed to the Israel-PLO peace talks escalate attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;3	Thirty-two Israelis have been killed since Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;4	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;5	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;6	Tens of thousands of Palestinians work in Israel and lose their only means of livelihood when barred from jobs by closures imposed following attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;7	The latest closure , which is gradually being lifted , sealed off the West Bank and Gaza following the Oct. 19 bombing of a Tel Aviv bus that left 22 civilians dead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;8	But despite the strict restrictions on West Bank and Gaza residents entering Israel , Wednesday 's Palestinian assailant managed to sneak through army roadblocks into the northern Israeli town of Afula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;9	`` We must reach a formula of separation , the ability to close off the hundreds of entrances that exist today , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;10	Shahal added that he was suggesting a permanent separation as part of the second stage of the autonomy accord with the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;11	Negotiations over the next stage of the agreement , that includes elections of a Palestinian governing council , are to resume next week in Cairo , Egypt .
APW_ENG_19941201.0058;12	The Cabinet is expected to discuss the upcoming talks during its weekly meeting Sunday , Shahal added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;0	Asian basketball players who are short in height but not on talent want an international league of their own .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;1	The Malaysian Basketball Association suggested Thursday that the game be split up into different height divisions as boxing is divided into weight divisions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;2	Association president Loke Yuen Yow said Asians were tired of losing to taller Americans and Europeans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;3	Under a proposal submitted to the German-based International Basketball Federation and the Asian Basketball Confederation , shorter teams from around the world would compete against each other .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;4	`` To narrow the gap , there is a need for a change in line with weightlifting and boxing , which have different -LRB- weight -RRB- categories , '' Loke said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0059;5	Loke suggested a second division of basketball be created for players under 6 feet , 3 inches -LRB- 190 centimeters -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;0	Vietnam 's Foreign Ministry gave credence Thursday to unofficial reports that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has already voted to admit Vietnam as its seventh member .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;1	Vietnam has long sought membership in anticipation of trade and investment benefits from closer ties to the more developed ASEAN economies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;2	A Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ngo Van Hoa , told a news conference that ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh announced the decision in a recent interview with a Malaysian newspaper , the Star .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;3	Asked if Vietnam had received any direct notification of the decision from ASEAN , Hoa only smiled and said , `` I am asking you to read between the lines . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;4	But he indicated that Vietnam regards the decision as official and final .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;5	Again quoting the Star , he said ASEAN officials made the decision at a meeting in Brunei Nov. 3-5 , with the actual admission to come next July when ASEAN foreign ministers hold their regular meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;6	Vietnam hopes for economic benefits from membership , but its admission also would dramatize the extent to which former Cold War divisions have melted away in the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;7	ASEAN was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War as a buffer against the spread of communism in Asia , represented by Vietnam and China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;8	It has become influential and active only in recent years since shifting its focus more heavily to economic cooperation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0060;9	The current members are Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore and Thailand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;0	The Orlando Magic are looking every bit like the U.S. National Basketball Association title contenders they were projected to be at the start of the season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;1	A 114-107 victory over the Sacramento Kings gave Orlando its eighth consecutive win , a record for the fifth-year franchise , and the best record in the league at 10-2 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;2	`` How you start is important , but how you finish means more , '' Magic coach Brian Hill said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;3	`` It may be imperative that we got out to this type of start . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;4	The Magic have been winning with balanced scoring , and Wednesday night 's victory was no different .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;5	Shaquille O'Neal led the way with 41 points , while Anfernee Hardaway added 23 and Nick Anderson 22 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;6	In other NBA games , it was Boston 118 , Detroit 115 ; Charlotte 105 , Miami 87 ; Cleveland 117 , the Los Angeles Lakers 79 ; Chicago 118 , Phoenix 105 ; and Seattle 109 , San Antonio 100 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;7	The Magic have n't lost since Nov. 10 , when the New York Knicks beat theam 101-99 at Madison Square Garden on a late jumper by Patrick Ewing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;8	O'Neal set the tone for Orlando , scoring the Magic 's first 13 points and finishing the first period with 17 on 7-for-8 shooting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;9	Then Anderson scored 16 , including four 3-pointers , in the second quarter to give Orlando a 66-52 halftime lead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;10	The Kings , who got 19 points from Brian Grant and 14 from Bobby Hurley , did n't get any closer than 14 points until the final minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;11	A season-high 37 points from Terry Mills and a flurry of 3-pointers down the stretch were n't enough to bring Detroit back against Boston , which got above .500 for the first time this season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;12	Dino Radja had 26 points and 12 rebounds at Boston Garden .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;13	The Pistons made five 3-pointers in 1:07 to close a 110-100 deficit to 116-115 with six seconds remaining .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;14	Dominique Wilkins , who had 18 points , then made two free throws for Boston with five seconds to go .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;15	Larry Johnson narrowly missed posting the Hornets ' first triple-double of the season , getting 23 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists against Miami .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;16	After starting the season 0-3 , the Hornets have won three consecutive games and seven of their past 10 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;17	Kevin Willis and Harold Miner had 14 points apiece for the visiting Heat , whose only lead of the game was after the opening basket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;18	Seven Cleveland players scored in double figures as the Cavaliers handed Los Angeles one of its most lopsided defeats ever .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;19	The loss ended the Lakers ' five-game winning streak and sent them home with a 3-1 record for their four-game road trip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;20	Mark Price , Terrell Brandon and Tony Campbell had 16 points each for Cleveland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;21	Vlade Divac had 14 and Nick Van Exel 13 for the Lakers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;22	Scottie Pippen did it all for Chicago , getting 35 points , nine rebounds , six assists and five steals while helping keep Charles Barkley in check in the second half .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;23	Pippen 's 13-for-17 shooting helped the Bulls withstand a late surge to beat Phoenix and end the Suns ' four-game winning streak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;24	Charles Barkley , making just his second start of the season , led the visiting Suns with 22 points .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;25	Seattle got 21 points from Gary Payton and 18 off the bench from Sam Perkins to help overcome David Robinson 's 42 points for San Antonio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;26	Seattle won its fourth straight overall and its seventh straight over the Spurs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;27	In reaching a season high , Robinson made 15 of 20 shots from the field , 12 of 14 free throws and had nine rebounds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0061;28	Detlef Schrempf had 17 points and led the host Sonics with seven rebounds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;0	Despite the criticism NATO has taken over its failure to stop the war in Bosnia , the Western alliance remains attractive to Eastern European countries eager to join .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;1	Future Bosnia policy is sure to dominate today 's meeting of the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;2	But the NATO allies also will launch a debate on its eastward expansion , beginning with a study that examines what effect newcomers will have on NATO 's command structure , how much enlargement will cost , and whether NATO troops will have to be based in the new member states .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;3	The study is expected to take a year to complete and will not address the issue of which countries can join , or when .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;4	Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are among those most anxious to join .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;5	The study will also make clear to prospective applicants what membership would cost them in money and materiel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;6	NATO is keenly aware of the anxieties in Moscow over the alliance 's enlargement plans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;7	Russia no longer opposes NATO expansion as such , but argues the issue is advancing too fast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;8	To counter fears that it seeks to isolate Russia , the allies today were to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;9	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev will meet with the NATO foreign ministers to wrap up details for Moscow 's participation in what NATO calls its Partnership for Peace program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;10	Twenty-three East European nations have joined that program , unveiled at a January summit of President Clinton and other NATO leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;11	Russia will be the eighth with a detailed military cooperation plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;12	The Russian deal , however , is thicker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;13	It runs the gamut from joint training and exercises to Western help in drafting defense budgets , force levels , proper defense plans and arms procurement practices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;14	What is special about the Russian plan is that NATO , outside the partnership program , will hold regular discussions with Moscow on European security issues , including nuclear arms safety and non-proliferation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0063;15	Russia linked its participation in Partnership for Peace to such special treatment , saying it was entitled to that as a nuclear power .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;0	As the old Democratic gang that long has ruled the U.S. Congress takes its final bows this week , another group of veteran Democrats is finding new stature : President Clinton 's old-timers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;1	The jobs of Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen have never looked more secure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;2	And Clinton 's chief of staff , former Republican Leon Panetta , now is the point man in White House efforts to reach out to Clinton 's newly powerful opponents in Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;3	Christopher , Bentsen and Panetta all have a history of working congenially with some of the Republicans who will be in command on Capitol Hill in Washington thanks to a major victory in Nov. 8 midterm elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;4	In Christopher 's case the White House also might not be keen to ask the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to approve a successor once it passes into the hands of arch-antagonist Jesse Helms , a Republican senator from North Carolina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;5	Panetta has been at the center all week , representing the White House 's views , sounding conciliatory and centrist , as the 103rd Congress meets for the last time to consider the world trade treaty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;6	He 's even spoken for the administration on Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;7	Panetta , a Democrat since he switched parties in the early 1970s and former chairman of the House of Representatives ' Budget Committee , is signaling he will continue to search for common ground with the Republicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;8	In listing Clinton 's new legislative priorities , Panetta says the first is `` to keep the economic recovery going and keep the deficit going downward . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;9	Second is welfare reform , which also has much Republican support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;10	Only after that does Panetta mention health care reform , once Clinton 's centerpiece initiative .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;11	The old-timers ' represent the center of the U.S. political spectrum , toward which Clinton is moving in order to deal with Republicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;12	`` All Democrats after Nov. 8 will be centrists , '' jokes Democratic Sen. John Breaux .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;13	`` I think the message was very clear , it was very loud , very emphatic . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;14	Expect to see more of Panetta and Bentsen and other old hands as the White House tries to work with the new leadership and sort out its identity crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;15	That means less of the younger , brasher faces , such as George Stephanopoulos and Democratic adviser Paul Begala , who have often spoken for the White House over the past two years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;16	`` This concept of a youthful White House is not reassuring to anybody , at home or abroad , '' said Sheila Tate , former aide to former first lady Nancy Reagan and to George Bush and now a public relations executive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;17	`` I think that has finally sunk in . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;18	Not only does the Clinton White House have to learn to work with the new Republican leadership and deal with the party 's emergent right wing , but it also will have to work with the new Democratic congressional leadership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;19	That could be a blessing in disguise for Clinton , since he got off to such a bad start the first time around .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;20	Many veteran Democratic figures were having their last hurrah this week , including House Speaker Tom Foley , Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski , the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;21	In reaching out to Republicans on the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement , Clinton was off to a good beginning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;22	But GATT also was an easy first test .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;23	It already had considerable support from both parties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;24	Come January , things will be far more complicated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0064;25	EDITOR 'S NOTE -- Tom Raum has covered the White House for The Associated Press since 1989 and has reported on government and national politics since 1973 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;0	Off-spinner Carl Hooper struck twice in a space of four deliveries to restrict India to 74 for the loss of two wickets at lunch on the opening day of the second test on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;1	India lead 1-0 in the three test series .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;2	Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and decided to bat first on a slow wicket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;3	West Indian fast bowlers Courtney Walsh and Kenneth Benjamin posed no problems for Indian openers who scored 35 off 14 overs in the first hour .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;4	Off-spinner Hooper struck as soon as he pressed into the attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;5	Bowling a good line and turning the ball just enough to beat the bat , he dislodged Manoj Prabhakar and Vinod Kambli in quick succession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0065;6	Navjot Siddhu and Sachin Tendulkar were batting 36 and 10 runs respectively at lunch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;0	In China 's only World AIDS Day activity not organized by the government , about a dozen activists took to Beijing streets Thursday to distribute pamphlets about AIDS prevention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;1	The leafleting was sponsored by the AIDS Action Project , a group with no government ties and no money , said one member , who asked that his name not be used .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;2	The group wants to encourage gay and bisexual men to serve as peer educators , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;3	It called for volunteers late Wednesday on a radio program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;4	It 's rare for a group not sanctioned by the government to be allowed to organize high-profile public activities such as passing out leaflets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;5	The government 's apparent tolerance for the volunteers Thursday was in line with recent calls for more efforts to teach people how to avoid the spread of AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;6	The leaflet the volunteers distributed on Wangfujing Street , one of the city 's main shopping areas , and in other parts of the city gave basic information about AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;7	It also said drug abusers and prostitutes , who are at high risk for the disease , `` have rights as human beings that should be respected . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;8	Prostitution and drugs have become growing problems in China since economic reforms and opening to the outside world began in the late 1970s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;9	Until recently , Chinese officials characterized AIDS as a disease that strikes only foreigners or fringe groups such as drug users .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;10	The director of a government-sponsored AIDS hotline was accused of empathizing with homosexuals and prostitutes and fired last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;11	Homosexuality is not accepted in China , and is technically illegal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;12	This fall , an official report noted an alarming lack of knowledge about AIDS and called for strengthening anti-AIDS programs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;13	AIDS is spread through sexual contact , contaminated needles shared by drug users , and infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;14	Government statistics show 1,453 people have tested positive for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , since 1985 in China , the China Daily reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;15	But AIDS activists said the number would be higher if the government used statistical methods to estimate the incidence of the virus , rather than simply counting the number of known cases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;16	The China Daily said experts at an international AIDS symposium this week in Beijing concluded that AIDS could spread rapidly in China in the next decade if preventive measures are not taken immediately .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;17	They also called for government funding for laboratories for blood testing and mass publicity campaigns to explain the testing 's importance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0066;18	China 's blood supply now is checked for HIV only in Beijing , Shanghai , Canton and Yunnan province , the official newspaper said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0067;0	A law strengthening Bangladesh 's electoral watchdog agency has failed to satisfy the opposition , whose campaign against the government has produced a nine-month political stalemate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;1	The law , passed by Parliament late Wednesday , provides for voter identity cards and gives the Election Commission authority to punish officials involved in malpractice .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;2	It also empowers the commission to stop voting at any polling station if it suspects `` coercion , intimidation and pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;3	The legislation was rejected by the opposition , which has boycotted Parliament since March 2 , accusing Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 's government of election fraud , corruption and mismanagement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;4	Opposition spokesman Mohammad Nasim said the bill `` is nowhere close to our demand for free and fair polls under an interim government . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;5	The opposition wants the government to step down three months before elections , yielding to a neutral caretaker government that would supervise voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;6	Mrs. Zia rejects the demand as `` unjustified and unconstitutional '' and has offered to bring opposition members into a pre-election Cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;7	The next election is scheduled for 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;8	After international mediation failed last month to break the deadlock , opposition leader Sheikh Hasina called for an accelerated campaign of national strikes and demonstrations .

APW_ENG_19941201.0067;10	Hasina has called for a 48-hour general strike next week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0067;11	Businessmen have complained that the prolonged dispute is hurting exports , discouraging foreign investment and diverting the government 's attention from its program to deregulate the economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;0	Ernesto Zedillo becomes president Thursday , promising profound political and legal reforms to match the market-opening that resulted in a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;1	The 42-year-old U.S.-trained economist caps an unlikely journey when he assumes the red , green and white presidential sash to start a six-year term as leader of this country of 90 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;2	The former Mexicali shoeshine boy achieved a Yale University doctorate in economics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;3	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , he was thrust into the campaign by the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , first choice of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;4	He won the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;5	U.S. Vice President Al Gore and President Fidel Castro are among 63 foreign dignitaries attending the inauguration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;6	Zedillo has pledged to use the near-absolute powers of Mexico 's presidency to weaken his own office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;7	He says he will give greater independence to the congress , the courts and local governments as well as the PRI itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;8	He says he will end the practice of having the president hand-pick all top PRI candidates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;9	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , is sure to continue his predecessor 's free-market economic policies -- a commitment underlined by the Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;10	Leading negotiators of the North American Free Trade Agreement were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;11	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;12	Zedillo also made a political opening by naming an opposition party member to the Cabinet for the first time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;13	Antonio Lozano , a conservative , will be attorney general -- a crucial post since Zedillo has made fighting government corruption a major part of his campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;14	The Cabinet includes three women -- the most ever appointed at the outset of a Mexican administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;15	They are Norma Samaniego as controller ; Silvia Hernandez for tourism ; and biologist Julia Carabias for fisheries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;16	On Tuesday , Zedillo reached out to the left as well , meeting with leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party and promising reforms to help make Mexico more democratic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;17	Salinas never met publicly with leaders of that main leftist opposition during his administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;18	The party apparently responded by pulling some 4,000 protesters out of the capital 's main plaza Wednesday , indicating an effort to avoid the confrontations that marred Salinas ' inauguration in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;19	The demonstrators were protesting alleged vote fraud in recent state elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;20	A protest was planned Thursday by leftist supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels of southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0068;21	That rebellion , stalled since January by a cease-fire , is one of the toughest problems facing the new president .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;0	President Boris Yeltsin ordered the government to sell off shares of Russia 's largest state television and radio company , with 51 percent of the stock remaining in state hands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;1	Ostankino , once called commonwealth television , is broadcast throughout the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;2	Its Moscow broadcasting tower was the scene of the worst fighting during the political uprising in October 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;3	Yeltsin 's decree Wednesday said the new venture , called Russian Public Television , would inherit Ostankino 's nationwide Channel One and would pay for the broadcast time on unchanged terms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;4	Ostankino chief Alexander Yakovlev , who was the architect of `` glasnost '' under former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , told the ITAR-Tass news agency that the sale would help make Russia 's television independent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;5	Yeltsin 's opponents have complained that state television favors the government and offers biased coverage of political events -- charges that Russian broadcast executives deny .
APW_ENG_19941201.0070;6	Twelve major companies and organizations will buy the 49 percent of Ostankino 's stock , including ITAR-Tass , Menatep , Stolichny and Inkombank commercial banks , Aeroflot International Airlines and the Avtovaz car manufacturer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;0	NATO foreign ministers met Thursday to begin laying the groundwork for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;1	But their two-day meeting was likely to be overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia that has put extraordinary strains on the relationship between the United States and its European allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;2	During the talks , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;3	It marks the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans , led by France , prevailed over Washington in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;4	The foreign ministers , though , are anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;5	They intend to order a study that would set out the terms and conditions for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0071;6	`` The main issue will be the enlargement -LRB- of NATO -RRB- ... I do n't think there will be a huge discussion of Bosnia , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he entered the headquarters of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;0	Laos has agreed for the first time to let former North Vietnamese soldiers into that country to help locate possible burial sites of missing American servicemen , U.S. officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;1	Laos ' agreement marks a breakthrough in efforts with Vietnam and the United States to resolve the fates of some of the 505 Americans listed as missing in that country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;2	`` This is something the United States has wanted to do for a long time , getting Vietnamese witnesses into Laos , '' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Adams , who works at the Hawaii headquarters of the unit responsible for MIA investigations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;3	Four Vietnamese , who claim to have witnessed the burials of several Americans inside Laos during the war in Indochina , will join in searches for their remains later this month and in January , said James Wold , U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for POW-MIA affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;4	Wold led an American delegation that met with Laotian and Vietnamese officials about cases that require the help of both Asian countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;5	`` The progress was good , '' Wold said after the four-hour meeting ended Thursday in Hanoi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;6	`` We achieved most of our objectives . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;7	He said the three sides agreed on a mechanism for additional visits by Vietnamese witnesses in other investigations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;8	Representatives of the three countries last met in November 1993 to discuss joint MIA investigations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;9	President Clinton has said Vietnam must show more cooperation in such efforts with neighboring Laos before the United States will establish full diplomatic relations with Hanoi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;10	Wold said Laotian and Vietnamese officials both expressed a willingness to help , but he spoke with particular praise about Vietnam 's efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;11	`` I would characterize their cooperation in working jointly with the U.S. and Laos as excellent , '' Wold said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;12	U.S. officials have said Laos generally has lagged behind Vietnam in helping to settle cases of the 2,214 Americans unaccounted for from the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;13	Communist Vietnamese troops occupied large sections of Laos during the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;14	Investigators plan to take one Vietnamese witness later this month to help look for evidence of 11 Americans missing at Phou Pha Thi mountain in northern Houaphan province , said Air Force Maj. Roger Overturf , public affairs officer for the MIA investigation task force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;15	Communist troops overran a secret U.S. aircraft navigation base there in 1968 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;16	Another three Vietnamese veterans will travel to central Savannakhat province in January for the search for clues to eight airmen shot down while flying in an AC-47 aircraft in 1966 , Overturf said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;17	Winning Laotian cooperation for the Vietnamese to visit the sites has been `` a tough nut to crack , '' Adams said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;18	Laos insisted on interviewing the witnesses first to gauge their credibility before letting them inside Laotian territory , Adams said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;19	Of the remaining U.S. servicemen still unaccounted for from the war , the Pentagon lists 1,624 in Vietnam , 505 in Laos and eight in China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0072;20	Most are known to be dead , U.S. officials say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;0	The Export-Import Bank of Japan is planning to extend 26 million dollars in a loan for a Japanese-Dutch joint venture for battery production in Poland , bank officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;1	The governmental bank and the joint venture company are expected to sign an agreement on the loan while President Lech Walesa is on a three-day visit to Japan beginning Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;2	Since Paris Club donor countries agreed to reduce Poland 's debts at its session in April 1991 , Japan has not provided public loans to the East European nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;3	However , the loan is exceptional because it will help fund a private firm 's project , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;4	Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. , Matsushita Battery Industrial Co. and N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken of the Netherlands set up the joint venture , called Philips Matsushita Poland S.A.
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;5	It is capitalized at 9.5 million dollars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;6	The firm will produce manganate batteries starting next September , with annual output expected to reach 600 million units in fiscal 1999 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;7	Factory construction is now underway .
APW_ENG_19941201.0073;8	The loan will be used to finance the building of production facilities and establishment of a sales network , bank officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0074;0	Red Army Faction terrorist Irmgard Moeller leaves prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0075;0	Irmgard Moeller , the Red Army Faction terrorist who blew up three American soldiers with a car bomb 22 years ago , walked out of prison Thursday after being freed early from her life sentence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0075;1	Wearing jeans , a leather jacket and red sweater , Moeller smiled , waved and gathered up bouquets as supporters `` international solidarity . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;0	About 150 supporters with red flags , champagne bottles and Christmas gifts waited outside the blue steel prison gates , chanting revolutionary slogans and singing 1960s anti-Vietnam War songs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;1	Demands for Moeller 's freedom have been a feature of leftist demonstrations for years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;2	The U.S. State Department and relatives of the victims objected to her release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;3	Moeller , 47 , the longest serving female prisoner in Germany , was freed because of her poor health , although she has shown no remorse and refused to cooperate with psychiatric evaluations to determine whether she is still dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;4	A court in the state of Schleswig-Holstein , where the prison is located , determined that she is not likely to commit another violent crime , and placed her on probation for five years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;5	Moeller 's release could lead to freedom for the seven other Red Army Faction terrorists still imprisoned in Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;6	After its last actions -- assassinating a German official in 1991 and blowing up a new prison in 1993 -- the Red Army Faction issued statements saying it was ending its 20-year campaign of attacks on what it called `` imperialist '' targets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;7	Moeller was convicted of driving one of two explosives-laden cars that blew up in a parking lot at U.S. Army Headquarters in Heidelberg on May 24 , 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;8	Capt. Clyde R. Bonner and two enlisted men , Charles L. Peck and Ronald A. Woodward , were killed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;9	In a statement after the bombing , the leftist Red Army Faction called the attack a protest against `` genocide '' in Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;10	Moeller was arrested six weeks after the attack and sentenced to life in prison plus 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;11	She lived through 12 hunger strikes and survived the night of Oct. 18 , 1977 , when three other imprisoned Red Army Faction leaders were found dead in their cells in what authorities said were suicides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;12	Moeller was found with four stabs in her chest , but survived .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;13	Politicians , theologians , authors and her prison warden campaigned for Moeller 's release on humanitarian grounds , although she apparently has not given up her political views .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;14	The news magazine Der Spiegel reported recently that Moeller still believes `` the armed struggle was legitimate . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;15	In a 1992 interview with the magazine , she was asked if she felt sympathy for the victims of Red Army Faction violence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;16	`` I ca n't deal with this so personally and individually , '' she replied .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;17	A striking black-haired woman when she went to jail at the age of 25 , Moeller 's lined face and graying hair now reflect her long life behind bars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;18	She is also said to be in deteriorating health , suffering from skin , eye and other ailments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;19	State prosecutors did not challenge the decision ordering her release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;20	But the U.S. State Department said on Nov. 1 , before the court 's decision , that the U.S. government opposes freeing terrorists who show no remorse for politically motivated attacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;21	U.S. Air Force Sgt. Charles Bonner , the 29-year-old son of victim Clyde Bonner , contacted German officials to protest against the decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;22	`` I was only 7 when my father was killed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;23	Our housing was just across from that parking lot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;24	That 's something I 'll never forget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;25	I think releasing her is ridiculous , '' he said in a telephone conversation last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;26	A daughter of strict Roman Catholic parents from Munich , Moeller became involved in the leftist student movement of the 1960s , got to know the founders of the Red Army Faction , Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof , and went underground in 1971 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;27	Moeller could throw some light on the deaths of Baader , Jan-Carl Raspe and Gudrun Ensslin , who died in October 1977 in the top-security Stuttgart Stammheim prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;28	German authorities and foreign experts ruled the deaths suicides , but Moeller , who survived , has always maintained they were state-ordered murders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;29	Early in her imprisonment , Moeller was held in isolation and harsh conditions in Stammheim , with no human contact apart from her guards and wardens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;30	In 1980 , she was moved to the relative comfort of the Luebeck prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0076;31	There , she and two other convicted terrorists shared a special unit that includes a kitchen , a bathroom , a television room and a library .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;0	The government will appeal a court ruling that could deprive Hong Kong anti-corruption officials of one of their most powerful weapons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;1	The Legal Department announced its decision Thursday , the day after a District Court invalidated a law whereby public servants can be prosecuted for failing to explain a standard of living above their salary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;2	Judge Gerard Muttrie said the law violates Hong Kong 's Bill of Rights because it requires the defendant to explain his income , thus reversing the principle of innocence until guilt is proved .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;3	The law is part of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance , a tough legislative package enacted in 1971 to curb the corruption then rampant in Hong Kong .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;4	The case before Muttrie , involving a senior estate surveyor , was the first based on the earnings clause since the enactment of the 1991 Bill of Rights , which affirms a person 's innocence until proved guilty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;5	The Independent Commission Against Corruption , Hong Kong 's powerful anti-graft agency , says 51 people were prosecuted under the clause before 1991 , and 32 were convicted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;6	ICAC official Jim Buckle was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying Muttrie 's ruling was `` quite a blow . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;7	`` The legislation is designed to catch people where you ca n't prove receiving individual bribes , '' he was quoted as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0077;8	`` People do n't normally come in and complain that they have been given bribes . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0078;0	Irmgard Moeller , the Red Army Faction terrorist who blew up three American soldiers with a car bomb 22 years ago , walked out of prison Thursday after being freed early from her life sentence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0078;1	Wearing jeans , a leather jacket and red sweater , Moeller smiled , waved and gathered up bouquets as supporters chanted `` international solidarity . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;0	Nervous civilians fled the Chechen capital for the countryside Thursday in fear of an attack by Russian troops trying to unseat the president of the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;1	A trickle of cars , packed tightly with family and a few belongings , left the city , along with a few trucks piled high with furniture and rugs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;2	Central Grozny was virtually empty following another nerve-jangling night of intermittent small arms fire from jumpy fighters around the city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;3	A single military jet roared over Grozny as a Russian ultimatum expired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;4	Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered warring Chechens to lay down their arms and release all prisoners by Thursday morning or face Russian military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;5	The ultimatum has been met with defiance by Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;6	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .

APW_ENG_19941201.0079;8	The conflict in the Caucasus Mountains region of southern Russia has escalated in the past week after months of skirmishes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;9	Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , a former Soviet air force general who was elected in 1991 and declared Chechnya 's independence , accuses Moscow of leading and arming his opponents in a civil war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;10	Moscow , which openly supports the opposition politically , denies offering any military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;11	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters in fierce fighting Saturday , Moscow officials said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;12	In Moscow , Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslev Kostikov indicated that Moscow was already moving to resolve the Chechen conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;13	`` A series of measures designed to improve resolutely the situation in the Chechen republic and restore the constitutionao order , law and protection of human rights has begun to be implemented , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;14	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' he said , referring to those captured on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;15	Russian media reported that several transport planes have brought weapons and troops to the border of Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;16	Most of the civilians fleeing Grozny went only a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- to stay with relatives in the countryside , in hopes that any battle for Grozny will be short and decisive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;17	`` Already , the majority of people have left the city , '' said 43-year-old Lyuba Ishkirchira , a Russian woman married to an ethnic Bashkir .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;18	`` I have no relatives to go to , and my father and mother are ill here -- I can not leave them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;19	A hairdresser with blond hair falling below her headscarf , Lyuba recently sent a telegram to her daughter urging her not to return to Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;20	`` If the Russians come and fight , it will be bad for us -- we 'll be taken hostage -LRB- by Chechens -RRB- , '' she said , referring to a centuries-old custom in the Caucasus in times of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;21	Grozny 's central bazaar , which once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty on Thursday .

APW_ENG_19941201.0079;23	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : Distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;24	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said one restaurant owner who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0079;25	Wrapped in an old leather coat and a thick , gray scarf , a 60-year-old Chechen woman walking among the bazaar 's empty stalls said Russia would have a tough time trying to overrun Chechnya .

APW_ENG_19941201.0080;0	The decision to authorize the study will mark a cautious move forward in drawing former adversaries in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;1	Poland , Hungary and others have appealed for membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;2	`` Today , we take an important step in the process that will lead to NATO expansion , '' Christopher told the opening session of the ministers ' meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;3	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;4	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;5	Instead , it will focus on such questions as : What effect will newcomers have on NATO 's common military command structure ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;6	How much will enlargement cost NATO ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;7	Do NATO troops need to be based in the new member states ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;8	The study will also make clear to prospective applicants what membership would cost them in money and materiel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0080;9	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;0	Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's popularity and the strength of his Congress Party was being tested in elections today in southern India , including his home state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;1	The voting for two state legislatures was seen as an important bellwether for the party , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;2	A loss in his own state of Andhra Pradesh could unleash rivalries in the governing party that Rao suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;3	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for the elections in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka , as well as two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;4	The voting is staggered to allow police to redeploy to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;5	The Andhra Pradesh campaign was marred by violence from left-wing militants , who claim to fight for peasants ' rights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;6	Land mines set by the militants killed at least 29 people in the past week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;7	The Congress campaign in Andhra Pradesh was thrown into disarray by the promise of a film star-turned-politician , N.T. Rama Rao , to sell rice to the poor at three cents a pound -- a sixth of the market rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;8	Pursuing free market reforms , Rao could offer no similar subsidies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;9	Rama Rao , 72 , who played Hindu deities in classic films , campaigned with the help of his young crowd-pulling wife , whom he married last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0081;10	The prime minister put his own prestige at stake by campaigning hard in his state , but his party 's prospects were hurt by infighting among the local politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;0	Morale is still high in the England cricket camp despite a 184-run defeat against Australia in the first Test in Brisbane , England captain Mike Atherton said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;1	Atherton said he believed the Test had shown England can counter the wizardry of leg-spinner Shane Warne .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;2	Warne took a career best 8-71 in the second innings Tuesday to give him match figures of 11-110 as he spun Australia to victory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;3	But Atherton said the efforts of Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe on the fourth day of the Test had shown Warne could be countered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;4	`` Hick and Thorpe were both able to score runs and they spent time at the crease , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;5	`` The spirit is not too bad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;6	The players are disappointed , naturally , at the Test defeat , but we have to get on with it and look forward to a new day tomorrow . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;7	The tourists will play the traditional match against a Sir Donald Bradman XI in Bowral , southwest of Sydney , on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0082;8	The Bradman side will be captained by former Australian skipper Allan Border and will feature young players who learned the game in the country areas of Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;0	Nervous civilians fled the Chechen capital for the countryside Thursday in fear of an attack by Russian troops trying to unseat the president of the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;1	A trickle of cars , packed tightly with family and a few belongings , left the city , along with a few trucks piled high with furniture and rugs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;2	Central Grozny was virtually empty following another nerve-jangling night of intermittent small arms fire from jumpy fighters around the city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;3	A single military jet roared over Grozny as a Russian ultimatum expired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;4	Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered warring Chechens to lay down their arms and release all prisoners by Thursday morning or face Russian military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;5	The ultimatum has been met with defiance by Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;6	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;7	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots , danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;8	The conflict in the Caucasus Mountains region of southern Russia has escalated in the past week after months of skirmishes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;9	Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , a former Soviet air force general who was elected in 1991 and declared Chechnya 's independence , accuses Moscow of leading and arming his opponents in a civil war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;10	Moscow , which openly supports the opposition politically , denies offering any military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;11	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters in fierce fighting Saturday , Moscow officials said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;12	In Moscow , Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslev Kostikov indicated that Moscow was already moving to resolve the Chechen conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;13	`` A series of measures designed to improve resolutely the situation in the Chechen republic and restore the constitutionao order , law and protection of human rights has begun to be implemented , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;14	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' he said , referring to those captured on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;15	Russian media reported that several transport planes have brought weapons and troops to the border of Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;16	Most of the civilians fleeing Grozny went only a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- to stay with relatives in the countryside , in hopes that any battle for Grozny will be short and decisive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;17	`` Already , the majority of people have left the city , '' said 43-year-old Lyuba Ishkirchira , a Russian woman married to an ethnic Bashkir .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;18	`` I have no relatives to go to , and my father and mother are ill here -- I can not leave them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;19	A hairdresser with blond hair falling below her headscarf , Lyuba recently sent a telegram to her daughter urging her not to return to Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;20	`` If the Russians come and fight , it will be bad for us -- we 'll be taken hostage -LRB- by Chechens -RRB- , '' she said , referring to a centuries-old custom in the Caucasus in times of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;21	Grozny 's central bazaar , which once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;22	A few old women trudged through the mud and wet leaves in search of bread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0083;23	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : Distrust of Russia .

APW_ENG_19941201.0084;0	A bid to salvage the near-bankrupt airline Iberia appeared doomed Thursday after overnight talks between management and pilots ended in total disagreement over pay cuts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;1	Management and representatives of the carrier 's two main unions had reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a viability plan that entailed a wage freeze , salary cuts averaging 8.5 percent and a reduction of some 3,500 jobs through early retirements and pay-offs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;2	Acceptance by the pilots would have paved the way for the plan to be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;3	The plan was considered crucial if the European Commission is to consider allowing the Spanish government to grant Iberia a 130 billion peseta -LRB- dlrs 1 billion -RRB- capital injection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;4	Iberia chairman said the state-owned company would hold meetings with other unions Thursday to evaluate the situation in view of the pilots ' rejection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;5	It was not immediately clear whether the lack of an across-the-board agreement meant a much more drastic plan touted last week by Iberia -- involving 5,200 job cuts and the sale of company assets -- might be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;6	That proposal triggered an one-day wildcat strike that paralyzed Spain 's airports and affected more than 100,000 travelers here and abroad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;7	Negotiations with the pilots reached a dead end as Iberia demanded a salary reduction of 15 percent based on 1992 earnings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;8	The pilots insisted that an existing wage agreement through 1995 must be implemented before the 15 percent salary cut could be enforced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;9	`` The company has presented a generic plan that does not guarantee the future of Iberia and only concentrates on disproportionate salary cuts , '' said Armando Guajardo of the pilots ' union SEPLA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;10	`` Management has let the situation rot to such an extent so that it could enforce such a plan worked out in advance , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;11	SEPLA said the company needed a complete overhaul and not just a reduction in salaries and staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;12	He said SEPLA had sent a letter to Iberia warning of drastic action by the pilots if the current wage agreement was broken .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;13	Pilots represent some 5 percent of the 24,000-strong staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;14	Salas has warned that the company would be technically bankrupt by March 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;15	Iberia has posted losses since 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;16	It ended last year 67 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 530 million -RRB- in the red while losses for this year are expected to top 40 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 300 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;17	Unions are to decide Thursday if a strike called several weeks ago for Friday still holds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0084;18	The company has said it would continue to operate all its flights on that day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;0	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis will no doubt occupy a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;1	At a breakfast with Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;2	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;3	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;4	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;5	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;6	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;7	On Friday , Christopher will meet with here his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;8	If nothing else , the new American stance is bound to heal a nasty rift within NATO over the alliance 's mission in the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;9	In his opening statement , Christopher sought to underscore the importance of NATO to the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;10	`` This alliance will continue to be the anchor of American engagement in Europe , the linchpin of transatlantic security , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;11	He also assured the 15 foreign ministers that the Clinton administration was committed to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe `` as part of our continuing engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;12	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;13	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;14	The transatlantic rift came to a head with the de-facto loss of the Muslim enclave of Bihac as a U.N. `` safe area . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;15	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;16	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0085;17	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;0	Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower Thursday for the second straight day in light trading .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;1	The Hang Seng Index , the market 's key indicator of blue chips , fell 35.46 points , or 0.4 percent , closing at 8,430.80 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;2	On Wednesday , the index had plunged 192 points .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;3	Turnover amounted to 3.027 billion Hong Kong dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 388 million -RRB- , down from Wednesday 's 3.915 billion Hong Kong dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 502 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;4	Brokers said trading was generally directionless , with many investors staying on the sidelines because of worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again soon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;5	Among losers , Cheung Kong fell 40 Hong Kong cents to 31.80 , Swire Pacific `` A '' fell 25 cents to 51.25 , Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 20 cents to 49.50 , and Hutchison Whampoa fell 10 cents to 30.70 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;6	Going against the trend was Hang Seng Bank , which rose 50 cents to 58.25 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0086;7	Remaining unchanged was HSBC Holdings at 85.50 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;0	Mark Calcavecchia got a putting lesson from fellow American Brad Faxon Thursday and then shot a 4-under-par 68 for a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Greg Norman Holden Classic golf tournament .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;1	Faxon offered to help after seeing Calcavecchia struggle on the greens during last week 's Australian Open and in practice around the 6,993-yard -LRB- 6,395-meter -RRB- , par-72 Royal Melbourne course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;2	The result was a flawless round for Calcavecchia that contained four birdies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;3	`` I regard Brad as one of the top five putters in the world , '' Calcavecchia said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;4	`` He told me I needed to lighten up a little bit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;5	He said I looked like I was trying to figure out so hard what was going on .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;6	`` He said my speed was all wrong .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;7	` Just stand up there and hit it , ' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;8	And for the most part it worked today . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;9	Calcavecchia is one shot ahead of three Australians -- Paul Moloney , American-based Steve Rintoul and Japan-based Peter McWhinney .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;10	Greg Norman , who complains that his many business activities are affecting his golf , was well in contention to win the tournament that bears his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;11	His first-round 71 put him a group with Faxon , Australian Open champion Robert Allenby and former U.S. PGA champion Wayne Grady .
APW_ENG_19941201.0087;12	The tournament continues through Sunday and offers a first prize of dlrs 115,000 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0089;0	A German diplomat 's report in advance of Thursday 's NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels accused the United States of sowing mistrust over Bosnia and the eastward expansion of the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;1	NATO Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen filed the cable to the German Foreign Ministry on Nov. 22 , according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung , which published excerpts and provided a copy to The Associated Press on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;2	At the time it was written , U.S. policymakers were urging more forceful attacks against Bosnian Serbs and lifting the arms embargo against the Muslim-led government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;3	There were reports , denied by U.S. officials , of secret military assistance to the Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;4	The U.S. moves caused especially deep mistrust in France , which is not part of NATO 's military structure but had been drawing closer to the alliance , the cable said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;5	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies in Brussels that the Clinton administration had swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , was the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;6	While the conflicts described in the classified document come as no surprise , the cable offered an unusually detailed view into NATO in the midst of a severe crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;7	Richthofen accused the United States of acting behind the backs of its allies and of lacking a clear strategy in its push to expand NATO membership eastwards at a time when NATO states are at odds on priorities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;8	Greece and Italy favor expanding NATO in the south , to include Romania , Bulgaria and possibly Malta , the paper says , while the northern alliance members think the top priorities are Poland , Hungary , and the Czech republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;9	The U.S.-designed Partnership for Peace for eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics has n't convinced many of the states it 's aimed at , `` thereby discrediting a piece of Alliance policy , '' the cable says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;10	`` Yet the U.S. administration is moving quickly to expand NATO without consultations on the ... consequences for the alliance , '' it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;11	The Republican victory in U.S. Congressional elections raised the threat of a U.S. policy even more alienating to Russia , it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0089;12	`` The alliance is divided and in crisis , '' the cable concludes , because in the post-Cold War era , it can only hold together with a clear sense of mission and strategy -- which it lacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0090;0	American yachtsman Steve Pettengill captured a narrow lead Thursday in the second leg of the BOC Challenge around-the-world yacht race .

APW_ENG_19941201.0090;4	South African J.J. Provoyeur was fifth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0090;5	Since the start , the yachts have been averaging about 200 miles -LRB- 320 kilometers -RRB- a day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0090;6	All of the leading yachts are 800 miles -LRB- 1,280 kilometers -RRB- east of Cape Town .
APW_ENG_19941201.0090;7	The sailors began the second leg of their journey from Cape Town to Sydney , Australia , on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0090;8	After Sydney , the 27,000-mile -LRB- 43,200-kilometer -RRB- race continues to Punta del Este , Uruguay , before finishing in Charleston .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;0	Defenders and attacking Serbs traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac on Thursday in the wake of a failed peace mission by U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali , the United Nations said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;1	The Bosnian army commander pledged that despite heavy losses in the northwest corner of Bosnia , Bihac would not fall into Serb hands and the Muslim-led army would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;2	Comments by Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further to reach a cease-fire and a comprehensive peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;3	Intransigence by both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;4	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;5	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;6	Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;7	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;8	Their leader , Radovan Karadzic , refused to come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali rejected entering Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;9	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;10	That was after it was clear the Boutros-Ghali mission was a failure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;11	Some shelling also was reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;12	There was no immediate information on any changes in the frontlines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;13	Sketchy information indicates that they have been stable in recent days , with Serbs holding 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;14	Bosnian Serbs have been joined in the fighting by Serbs from neighboring Croatia and renegade Muslims under warlord Fikret Abdic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;15	In the newspaper interview , Delic said government forces still could win .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;16	`` Bihac will not fall , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;17	The Bosnian army is much stronger and better-organized than the rag-tag group that formed at the beginning of the war with rebel Serbs in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;18	`` That does not mean we will not lose some battles , '' Delic said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;19	`` But we definitely will win the war . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;20	But with the threat of Western military force against them discredited , the Serbs appeared to be in no mood to compromise .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;21	NATO ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday were to hear a proposal from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for a new international conference on former Yugoslavia at which the Serbs could make demands for new peace proposals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;22	Already , senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they long have desired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;23	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;24	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;25	The Bosnian Serbs would n't mind seeing the United Nations leave Bosnia , believing it would allow them to force the government to settle on Serb terms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;26	A withdrawal would likely lead to a bloodier conflict and could draw peacekeepers into battle as both sides rushe to seize U.N. equipment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;27	Widespread hardship probably would result .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;28	Boutros-Ghali stressed that the United Nation feeds an estimated 3 million people across the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;29	Most are in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0091;30	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;0	A German diplomat 's report in advance of Thursday 's NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels accused the United States of sowing mistrust over Bosnia and the eastward expansion of the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;1	NATO Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen filed the cable to the German Foreign Ministry on Nov. 22 , according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung , which published excerpts and provided a copy to The Associated Press on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;2	At the time it was written , U.S. policymakers were urging more forceful attacks against Bosnian Serbs and lifting the arms embargo against the Muslim-led government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;3	There were reports , denied by U.S. officials , of secret military assistance to the Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;4	The U.S. moves caused especially deep mistrust in France , which is not part of NATO 's military structure but had been drawing closer to the alliance , the cable said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;5	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies in Brussels that the Clinton administration had swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , was the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;6	While the conflicts described in the classified document come as no surprise , the cable offered an unusually detailed view into NATO in the midst of a severe crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;7	Richthofen accused the United States of acting behind the backs of its allies and of lacking a clear strategy in its push to expand NATO membership eastwards at a time when NATO states are at odds on priorities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;8	Greece and Italy favor expanding NATO in the south , to include Romania , Bulgaria and possibly Malta , the paper says , while the northern alliance members think the top priorities are Poland , Hungary , and the Czech republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;9	The U.S.-designed Partnership for Peace for eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics has n't convinced many of the states it 's aimed at , `` thereby discrediting a piece of Alliance policy , '' the cable says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;10	`` Yet the U.S. administration is moving quickly to expand NATO without consultations on the ... consequences for the alliance , '' it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;11	The Republican victory in U.S. Congressional elections raised the threat of a U.S. policy even more alienating to Russia , it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0092;12	`` The alliance is divided and in crisis , '' the cable concludes , because in the post-Cold War era , it can only hold together with a clear sense of mission and strategy -- which it lacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher is telling the NATO allies the Clinton administration has swung to their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;1	It is the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans led by France prevailed over the United States in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;2	It is a difficult assignment for Christopher , putting him in the awkward position of shifting gears even while denying U.S. policy on the war has changed or that there is a trans-Atlantic rift .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;3	Trying to patch over the embarrassing dispute , Christopher pronounced the alliance strong and he charted a plan for growth through absorption of East European countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;4	A ceremony was scheduled to establish links to Russia , for decades the direct target of NATO 's massive military preparedness program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;5	He told the allies in a speech that `` the tragedy of the war and bloodshed in Bosnia does not diminish our responsibility to build a comprehensive European security architecture . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;6	`` America 's interests in Europe have not changed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;7	`` Neither have the basic principles guiding our engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;8	And at the top of the list , Christopher said today , was that `` the United States has enduring political , military , economic and cultural links to europe that must and will be preserved . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;9	Earlier , at breakfast with Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;10	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;11	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;12	However , his aides spread the word a trip by Christopher to Belgrade was unlikely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;13	Asked if the troops would be withdrawn , Hurd replied grimly : `` We certainly hope not . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;14	National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , in a speech Wednesday at Princeton University , acknowledged it is a path `` rife with frustrations and setbacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;15	Nonetheless , he said , `` it 's the best , the steadiest course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;16	... Both sides face the same choice : They can perpetuate a bloody military stalemate or they can stop the senseless killing and come to terms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;17	By chance , it is the U.S. turn to preside over a meeting today of the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's policy-making arm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;18	This puts Christopher under an even brighter spotlight , and he was responding both with a brief speech opening the session and a detailed one outlining U.S. plans for NATO 's expansion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;19	On Friday , Christopher intends to lay out the U.S. approach to the Bosnian war in a meeting with Hurd and Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe of France , Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and Klaus Kinkel of Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;20	It is centered on a call for an international peace conference that would give the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity to demand changes in the peace plan they have rejected repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;21	They already have strong intimations of support from the Clinton administration in pressing for cross-border political ties to the Serb-dominated government in Belgrade -- a big step toward their goal of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;22	And even the peace plan map the Bosnian Serbs rejected is open to negotiations , Clinton administration officials promised in this week of candid admissions by Defense Secretary William Perry and other senior U.S. officials that the Bosnian Serbs can not be stopped in their territorial conquests by military force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;23	`` This alliance will continue to be the anchor of American engagement in Europe , the linchpin of trans-Atlantic security , '' Christopher said in a brief statement opening the North Atlantic Council session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;24	He also assured the 15 foreign ministers that the Clinton administration was committed to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe `` as part of our continuing engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;25	The European allies , particularly France and Britain , have taken this position throughout the 31-month war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;26	They managed to limit NATO air strikes despite U.N. assurances that Bihac , the mostly Muslim town on the verge of falling to the Serbs , was a `` safe area '' from which heavy weapons were to be excluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;27	They also hemmed in the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;28	Lake , in his speech at Princeton , stressed that NATO had chosen not to intervene directly in Bosnia and had given the lead to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;29	`` Right or wrong , that decision has consequences with which we must continue to struggle , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;30	Before leaving Washington , Christopher grumbled to reporters about NATO 's refusal to engage in a sustained bombardment of Serb positions in the northwestern region of the bloodied country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;31	But having threatened the Serbs in the past with NATO might , he abandoned the threat when asked what `` sticks '' the United States was using to persuade the Serbs to relinquish their grip on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;32	If they kept fighting , Christopher said , they risked Serbia closing its border and a tightening of sanctions -- measures that are far less threatening than attacks by NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;33	Serbia has been the principal arms supplier to Serbs in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;34	And while Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has promised to cut them off , a senior U.S. official said there was considerable `` leakage '' and arms were getting through .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;35	Seeking to limit the damage to the alliance , which successfully stood up to the Soviet Union but has caved on Bosnia , Christopher said he wanted to stress that `` the crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia ; it 's not about NATO and its future . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;36	But NATO 's impotence has raised questions about NATO 's future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;37	Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested after meeting in Brussels with alliance officials that the alliance may have become irrelevant .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;38	`` There 's been no pressure on the Serbs and until there 's some leverage , it 's going to be very difficult to stop the fighting and reach some kind of settlement , '' Dole said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;39	Challenging the influential Republican , Hurd said Dole `` does not understand the consequences '' for Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , for Muslim enclaves and for the people of the country if U.N. peacekeepers were withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0093;40	`` NATO is a collective security organization and that is to say it is the organization which keeps us safe in our beds at night , '' Hurd said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;0	Bitter Russians lashed out at the U.S. Embassy on Thursday after being surprised by what one called `` the latest insult '' to Russians trying to visit the United States : a new dlrs 20 visa application fee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;1	`` I wonder why we 're trying so hard to go to this ` wonderful ' country , America , when its embassy has so little respect for us , '' said Sergei Tumbasov , a construction engineer hoping to go to Virginia on business .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;2	The U.S. Embassy announced Wednesday several changes to its much-criticized visa application process , including the new fee , which was payable in rubles and went into effect Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;3	Human rights activists and Russian officials have criticized consular officials in recent months for rudeness and for humiliating visa applicants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;4	Tumbasov said no one had told him of the fee until he arrived at the embassy Thursday morning , not even the consular officer he had spoken to the day before .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;5	The new non-refundable application fee is especially painful for the more than 100 applicants who are rejected for visas by the Moscow embassy daily .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;6	`` This unexpected fee is the final insult in an absolutely absurd process , '' said Marina Orlova , an eye doctor from the prestigious Fyodorov Clinic , who was turned away Thursday for not sufficiently proving her intent to return to Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;7	`` Who do they think we are ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;8	We 're doctors , professionals . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;9	If Orlova returns to the embassy with further documentation to support her application , she must pay an additional dlrs 20 , according to the new regulations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;10	This fee does not include the cost of the visa itself , which runs an additional dlrs 20 for a single-entry visa , or dlrs 120 for a multi-entry visa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;11	`` The system is made for the mafia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;12	No one else can afford it , '' Orlova added loudly , prompting a guard to ask her to leave the crowded sidewalk in front of the embassy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;13	An average of 550 people apply for U.S. visas at this embassy daily , and about 133,000 people have applied in the past year , according to embassy figures .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;14	But the overwhelmed consular office can not hold all the applicants , forcing them to wait for hours outside , even in the city 's bitter December weather .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;15	Vladimir Gulagin , a technical consultant planning a business trip to New York , brushed the falling snow off a medium-sized suitcase full of documents Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;16	Gulagin was refused a visa on Tuesday and was told to return with further documentation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;17	He was not told , however , about the new fee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;18	`` It 's a good thing I had borrowed money from my wife this morning , '' Gulagin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;19	`` I spent most of my paycheck yesterday , getting all these documents copied . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;20	After announcing the new fee , U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Wednesday outlined a number of steps designed to ease the visa process , including an `` express lane '' and easier processing for business visa applications .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;21	Vasily Ignatkin , head of the visa department at the Diplomatic Corps Administration Bureau , said the changes in the process were welcome , but that it would be `` some time before any serious improvements are evident . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;22	Those in line outside the embassy were even more skeptical .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;23	`` It 's all talk , '' Tumbasov said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0094;24	`` They 're trying to comfort us -LRB- with the other changes -RRB- while they ask us for more money . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0098;0	Taiwan 's first homemade patrol boat became operational Thursday to help defend the island 's coastal waters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;1	The 500-ton vessel will be equipped with a locally developed Hsiung-feng I anti-ship missile system and 40mm artillery , the navy said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;2	`` The boat is very swift and has powerful ammunition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;3	The navy 's defense capability can be significantly boosted if we can have more of the boats in the future , '' navy chief Ku Chung-lien said at the commissioning ceremony in Kaohsiung , southern Taiwan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;4	The `` Chinchiang '' was privately manufactured by the Lien Ho Shipbuilding Co. and the United Ship Design and Development Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;5	The navy declined to say how many it will buy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;6	It was priced at 490 million Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 18.15 million -RRB- and construction began in August last year , said Lien Ho 's vice manager , Tai Fu-pin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;7	The navy said the boat also will be used to crack down on smuggling activities and protect Taiwanese fishing boats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;8	Taiwan wants to buy advanced weapons abroad and develop military technology at home to meet threats from China , which regards the island as a breakaway province and has not renounced the use of force to recover it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0098;9	Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government which fled China 's mainland in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;0	A 44-year-man convicted of stabbing three women to death in 1977 was hanged Thursday , news reports said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;1	It was the first execution reported in one year in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;2	The mass-circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun and Kyodo News Service reported that Yukio Ajima was hanged at the Tokyo Detention House , nine years after the Supreme Court rejected his final appeal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;3	Executions in Japan , all by hanging , are carried out in secret and authorities give no information afterward to media , relatives or the public , although there has been recent discussion of announcing executions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;4	Relatives and lawyers now confirm executions by checking whether the condemned person 's name has been crossed off registration lists at government offices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;5	The execution came five days after the Prime Minister 's Office announced the results of its first survey in five years on the death penalty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;6	It showed 73.8 percent of those responding favored retaining the death penalty , the highest percentage since such surveys began in 1956 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;7	The office said 13.6 percent favored abolition , the lowest figure in 38 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;8	Senior Justice Ministry officials suggested that public opinion may have been influenced by recent increases in violent crime in Japan , generally considered a safe country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;9	In the survey , the office questioned 3,000 adults at random throughout the country in early September .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;10	In the last survey , in 1989 , 67 percent favored the death penalty and 16 percent opposed it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;11	Before Thursday , the last reported executions were four on Nov. 26 , 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;12	Before that , three on March 26 , 1993 , were the first reported in three years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;13	Executions require an order from the justice minister , and some holders of the office have declined .
APW_ENG_19941201.0099;14	Before Thursday 's reported hanging , 59 convicts had been awaiting execution , according to Amnesty International Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0100;0	Asian stock markets closed generally lower Thursday , with share prices falling in Tokyo after three days of gains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0100;1	Tokyo 's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 62.02 points , or 0.33 percent , closing at 19,013.60 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0100;2	On Wednesday , the average had gained 149.13 points , or 0.79 percent , to 19,075.62 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0100;3	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was down 1.21 points , or 0.08 percent , to 1,519.20 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0101;0	NATO foreign ministers met Thursday to begin laying the groundwork for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;1	But their two-day meeting was likely to be overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia that has put extraordinary strains on the relationship between the United States and its European allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;2	During the talks , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;3	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the European allies , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;4	The change in U.S. policy will help heal an unprecedented rift within the alliance over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;5	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;6	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;7	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;8	NATO 's new Secretary General Willy Claes appealed for unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;9	`` We are now being put to -LRB- the -RRB- test , and I have every confidence that our solidarity will see us through now has it has in even darker circumstances . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;10	The foreign ministers are anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;11	They intend to order a study that would set out the terms and conditions for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;12	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' Claes told the meeting 's opening ceremony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;13	The decision to authorize the study will mark a cautious move forward in drawing former adversaries in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;14	Poland , Hungary and others have appealed for membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;15	`` Today , we take an important step in the process that will lead to NATO expansion , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;16	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;17	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;18	Instead , it will focus on such questions as : What effect will newcomers have on NATO 's common military command structure ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;19	How much will enlargement cost NATO ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;20	Do NATO troops need to be based in the new member states ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;21	The study will also make clear to prospective applicants what membership would cost them in money and materiel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;22	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;23	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis will no doubt occupy a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;24	At a breakfast with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;25	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;26	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;27	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;28	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;29	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;30	On Friday , Christopher will meet with here his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;31	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0101;32	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;0	Defenders and attacking Serbs traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac on Thursday in the wake of a failed peace mission by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;1	The Bosnian army commander pledged that despite heavy losses in the northwest corner of Bosnia , Bihac would not fall into Serb hands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;2	Comments by Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo newspaper Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise to reach a cease-fire and a comprehensive peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;3	Intransigence by both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time Wednesday that U.N. peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;4	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;5	Under the plan , the Serbs would have to give up about a third of the territory they have conquered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;6	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;7	Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;8	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;9	Their leader , Radovan Karadzic , refused to come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali rejected entering Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;10	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and into Thursday , after it was clear that Boutros-Ghali 's mission had failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;11	Some shelling was also reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;12	There was no information on any changes in the frontlines , which have been stable in the past few days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;13	Sketchy reports indicate the Serbs hold 30 to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;14	Bosnian Serbs have been joined in the offensive by Serbs from neighboring Croatia and renegade Muslims under warlord Fikret Abdic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;15	In the newspaper interview , Delic said government forces still could win .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;16	The Bosnian army is much stronger and better-organized than the rag-tag group formed at the beginning of the war with rebel Serbs in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;17	`` That does not mean we will not lose some battles , '' Delic said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;18	`` But we definitely will win the war . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;19	With members of NATO and the United Nations unwilling to use vigorous military force , the Serbs appeared to be in no mood to compromise .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;20	NATO ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday were to hear a proposal from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for a new international conference on the former Yugoslavia at which the Serbs could make demands for new peace proposals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;21	Already , senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;22	Serb nationalists have in part waged war to create a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;23	The Bosnian Serbs would n't mind seeing the United Nations leave Bosnia , believing it would allow them to force the government to settle on Serb terms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;24	A withdrawal would likely lead to a bloodier conflict and could draw peacekeepers into battle as both sides rush to seize U.N. equipment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;25	Widespread hardship probably would result .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;26	Boutros-Ghali stressed that the United Nations feeds an estimated 3 million people across the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;27	Most are in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0102;28	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0103;0	Defenders and attacking Serbs traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac on Thursday in the wake of a failed peace mission by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .

APW_ENG_19941201.0104;0	Irmgard Moeller , the Red Army Faction terrorist who blew up three American soldiers with a car bomb 22 years ago , walked out of prison Thursday after being freed early from her life sentence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;1	Wearing jeans , a leather jacket and red sweater , Moeller smiled , waved and gathered up bouquets from fans , who were singing 1960s anti-Vietnam War songs and chanting revolutionary slogans outside the blue steel prison gates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;2	`` It still feels unreal , '' she said , her words nearly drowned out by the chanting crowd of 200 , who carried red flags , champagne bottles and Christmas presents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;3	Moeller , 47 , appealed for freedom for other `` political prisoners '' and thanked her supporters and friends for helping her cope through 22 years in prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;4	Then she was driven away in her lawyer 's car , while a loudspeaker mounted on a truck played `` Internationale , '' the revolutionary socialist hymn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;5	Moeller was convicted of driving one of two explosives-laden cars that blew up in a parking lot at U.S. Army Headquarters in Heidelberg on May 24 , 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;6	Capt. Clyde R. Bonner and two enlisted men , Charles L. Peck and Ronald A. Woodward , were killed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;7	The U.S. State Department and relatives of the victims objected to her release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;8	Moeller , the longest serving female prisoner in Germany , was freed because of her poor health , although she has shown no remorse and refused to cooperate with psychiatric evaluations to determine whether she is still dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;9	A court in the state of Schleswig-Holstein , where the prison is located , determined that she is not likely to commit another violent crime , and placed her on probation for five years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;10	Moeller 's release could lead to freedom for the seven other Red Army Faction terrorists still imprisoned in Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;11	After its last actions -- assassinating a German official in 1991 and blowing up a new prison in 1993 -- the Red Army Faction said it was ending its 20-year campaign of attacks on what it called `` imperialist '' targets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;12	The Red Army Faction faction had issued a statement after the 1972 Heidelberg bombing , calling it a protest against `` genocide '' in Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;13	Moeller was arrested six weeks after the attack and sentenced to life in prison plus 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;14	She lived through 12 hunger strikes and survived the night of Oct. 18 , 1977 , when three other imprisoned Red Army Faction leaders were found dead in their cells in what authorities said were suicides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;15	Moeller was found with four stabs in her chest , but survived .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;16	Politicians , theologians , authors and her prison warden campaigned for Moeller 's release on humanitarian grounds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;17	In a 1992 interview with the magazine Der Spiegel , Moeller was asked if she felt sympathy for the victims of Red Army Faction violence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;18	`` I ca n't deal with this so personally and individually , '' she replied .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;19	A striking black-haired woman when she went to jail at the age of 25 , Moeller 's lined face and graying hair now reflect her long life behind bars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;20	She is also said to be in deteriorating health , suffering from skin , eye and other ailments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;21	State prosecutors did not challenge the decision ordering her release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;22	But the U.S. State Department said on Nov. 1 , before the court 's decision , that the U.S. government opposes freeing terrorists who show no remorse for politically motivated attacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;23	U.S. Air Force Sgt. Charles Bonner , the 29-year-old son of victim Clyde Bonner , contacted German officials to protest against the decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;24	`` I was only 7 when my father was killed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;25	Our housing was just across from that parking lot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;26	That 's something I 'll never forget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;27	I think releasing her is ridiculous , '' he said in a telephone conversation last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;28	A daughter of strict Roman Catholic parents from Munich , Moeller became involved in the leftist student movement of the 1960s , got to know the founders of the Red Army Faction , Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof , and went underground in 1971 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;29	Moeller could throw some light on the deaths of Baader , Jan-Carl Raspe and Gudrun Ensslin , who died in October 1977 in the top-security Stuttgart Stammheim prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;30	German authorities and foreign experts ruled the deaths suicides , but Moeller , who survived , has always maintained they were state-ordered murders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;31	Early in her imprisonment , Moeller was held in isolation and harsh conditions in Stammheim , with no human contact apart from her guards and wardens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;32	In 1980 , she was moved to the relative comfort of the Luebeck prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0104;33	There , she and two other convicted terrorists shared a special unit that includes a kitchen , a bathroom , a television room and a library .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;0	A contempt of court case against an American scholar and a Paris-based newspaper was postponed Thursday for five weeks , the state television reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;1	The case involves an article by Christopher Lingle published in the International Herald Tribune on Oct. 7 in which he criticized unnamed Asian governments and their court systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;2	In its suit on Nov. 11 , the government charged Lingle , who used to teach at the National University of Singapore ; the International Herald Tribune -LRB- Singapore -RRB- Private Ltd. ; the Tribune 's regional editor , Michael Richardson , an Australian based in Singapore ; and the Tribune 's publisher , Richard McClean .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;3	The case was scheduled to be held Friday in the High Court but was postponed to Jan. 9 to accommodate the Tribune , whose lawyer requested more time to prepare the case , the television reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;4	K. Shanmugam , the Tribune lawyer , was not immediately available for comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;5	The case reflects the friction between the Singapore government and the foreign press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;6	The government controls the local media by issuing licenses to operate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;7	In the past , the government has temporarily restricted the circulation of the newspaper Asian Wall Street Journal and the magazines Time , Asiaweek and the Far Eastern Economic Review for articles it considered offensive or defamatory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;8	The International Herald Tribune , published jointly by the New York Times and the Washington Post , was threatened earlier this year with a defamation suit over an article that alleged nepotism in Singapore .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;9	The newspaper apologized but the two sides have not reached a settlement yet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;10	In the latest contempt case , the government has also named Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. , a local company that prints the Tribune 's Singapore edition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;11	Contempt of court is punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both , but the law leaves the amount or term to the judge 's discretion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;12	Lingle is not expected to appear for the court deliberations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;13	He returned to his home in Atlanta , Ga. , on Oct. 21 , fearing arrest after police started an investigation against him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0105;14	He also resigned his year-old job teaching European economics at the university here .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;0	The Achille Lauro smoldered on a placid sea Thursday , a day after a raging fire forced the nearly 1,000 people aboard to take to lifeboats and abandon the cruise ship off Somalia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;1	Two people were reported dead from the Italian liner , which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;2	At mid morning on Thursday , the empty , scarred vessel was still afloat , listing badly to port .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;3	White steam and and gray smoke poured from its port side and smaller streams came drifting out of the lower starboard deck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;4	Though her name was still visible on the stern , the cruise ship 's blue and white paint was scorched and mottled , the white stars on her two smokestacks blackened by heat and soot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;5	Although crippled , the Achille Lauro appeared in no danger of sinking quickly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;6	`` She is presently listing at about 20 degrees .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;7	There 's a tremendous amount of smoke and steam still coming from over three quarters of the length of the vessel , '' John Briand , captain of the oil tanker Lima , told the BBC .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;8	The fire started Wednesday , apparently in the passenger area , but the cause was not known , said the ship 's owner , Starlauro of Genoa , Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;9	Eight people were injured in the fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;10	About 60 crewmembers fought the fire before abandoning the 23,478-ton ship 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- south of the Horn of Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;11	The pilot of a plane carrying an Associated Press reporter and cameramen put the ship 's position at 160 miles east of the small Somali fishing village of Eil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;12	Capt. Ferdinando Lolli , a port official in Rome , said the ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;13	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch and British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;14	Late Wednesday evening , Italian Coast Guard officials reported that everyone on the Achille Lauro was accounted for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;15	Italian news agencies identified the dead as a Briton and a German .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;16	The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian King was one of the first ships to arrive at the scene and took on about 800 people , said a coast guard official in Rome , Adm. Eugenio Sicurezza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;17	Many had to spend the night on the Hawaiian King 's deck , Briand said , and other ships sent over food , blankets and toiletries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;18	Two U.S. warships , the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton , arrived overnight and dispatched helicopters to ferry water , food and medical supplies to the survivors , said Cmdr. T. McCreary , spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command in the Gulf .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;19	`` Quite a few people were injured in the transfer -- there 's a few broken bones and some pretty tortured souls , '' Briand said , adding that many of the rescued passengers were elderly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;20	The commerical and Navy ships will divide up the passengers Thursday and send them on , mostly to Mombasa , Kenya , and Djibouti , McCreary said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;21	Others reportedly will be taken to the Seychelles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;22	Briand said the transfer was expected to take most of the day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;23	His ship was taking on the Achille Lauro 's 50 Honduran crewmembers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;24	The Achille Lauro left Genoa on Nov. 19 , stopped in Israel , and its next port of call was to be Durban , South Africa , on Friday , said Carla Gotta , a spokeswoman for the cruise ship 's owner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;25	The terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985 shot American Leon Klinghoffer and pushed him in his wheelchair off the ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;26	The hijackers escaped the vessel and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;27	Launched in 1946 in the Netherlands , the Achille Lauro was acquired 20 years later by the Neapolitan shipping dynasty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;28	It first transported Italian immigrant workers to and from Australia and was outfitted for pleasure cruises in 1970 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;29	The liner rammed a fishing boat in 1971 off Italy , killing a Neapolitan fisherman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;30	And on Dec. 2 , 1981 , fire broke out aboard ship off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0106;31	Panicked passengers jumped into the sea , and two of them drowned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;0	A bid to salvage the near-bankrupt airline Iberia appeared doomed Thursday after overnight talks between management and pilots ended in total disagreement over pay cuts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;1	Management and representatives of the carrier 's two main unions had reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a viability plan that entailed a wage freeze , salary cuts averaging 8.5 percent and a reduction of some 3,500 jobs through early retirements and pay-offs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;2	Acceptance by the pilots would have paved the way for the plan to be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;3	The plan was considered crucial if the European Commission is to consider allowing the Spanish government to grant Iberia a 130 billion peseta -LRB- dlrs 1 billion -RRB- capital injection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;4	Iberia chairman Javier Salas said the state-owned company would hold meetings with other unions Thursday to evaluate the situation in view of the pilots ' rejection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;5	It was not immediately clear whether the lack of an across-the-board agreement meant a much more drastic plan touted last week by Iberia -- involving 5,200 job cuts and the sale of company assets -- might be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;6	That proposal triggered an one-day wildcat strike that paralyzed Spain 's airports and affected more than 100,000 travelers here and abroad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;7	Negotiations with the pilots reached a dead end as Iberia demanded a salary reduction of 15 percent based on 1992 earnings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;8	The pilots insisted that an existing wage agreement through 1995 must be implemented before the 15 percent salary cut could be enforced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;9	`` The company has presented a generic plan that does not guarantee the future of Iberia and only concentrates on disproportionate salary cuts , '' said Armando Guajardo of the pilots ' union SEPLA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;10	`` Management has let the situation rot to such an extent so that it could enforce such a plan worked out in advance , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;11	SEPLA said the company needed a complete overhaul and not just a reduction in salaries and staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;12	He said SEPLA had sent a letter to Iberia warning of drastic action by the pilots if the current wage agreement was broken .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;13	Pilots represent some 5 percent of the 24,000-strong staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;14	Salas has warned that the company would be technically bankrupt by March 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;15	Iberia has posted losses since 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;16	It ended last year 67 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 530 million -RRB- in the red while losses for this year are expected to top 40 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 300 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;17	Unions are to decide Thursday if a strike called several weeks ago for Friday still holds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0107;18	The company has said it would continue to operate all its flights on that day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;0	Police Minister Moshe Shahal recommended Thursday that Israel bar entrance to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza until their self-rule government proved capable of preventing attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;1	Shahal spoke to Israel radio a day after a Palestinian axed a 19-year-old woman soldier to death and two days after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he wanted to begin separating Palestinians and Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;2	Talk of dismantling small , isolated settlements was also growing this week , as Islamic militants opposed to the Israel-PLO peace process escalate attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;3	Thirty-two Israelis have been killed since Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;4	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;5	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;6	Tens of thousands of Palestinians work in Israel and lose their only means of livelihood when barred from jobs during the border closings imposed in the wake of attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;7	The latest closing , which is gradually being lifted , sealed off the West Bank and Gaza following the Oct. 19 bombing of a Tel Aviv bus that left 22 civilians dead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;8	Despite the strict restrictions on West Bank and Gaza residents entering Israel , Wednesday 's Palestinian assailant managed to sneak through army roadblocks into the northern Israeli town of Afula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;9	Shahal said the permanent separation should be part of the second stage of the autonomy accord with the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;10	The second phase includes elections of a Palestinian governing council and the expansion of self-rule beyond Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;11	Negotiations over the next stage are to resume next week in Cairo , Egypt .
APW_ENG_19941201.0108;12	The Cabinet is expected to discuss the upcoming talks during its weekly meeting Sunday , Shahal added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;0	Police ousted hunger-striking politicians from government offices but the reformed East German communists declared Thursday they would continue their protest against a whopping 67-million-mark -LRB- dlrs 43-million -RRB- tax levy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;1	The Party of Democratic Socialism , or PDS , said 11 people , including party president Lothar Bisky and Gregor Gysi , leader of the party 's 30 members of parliament , were fasting Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;2	The protest spread to the eastern cities of Dresden and Schwerin , where hundreds of party members and sympathizers demonstrated Thursday morning at state legislatures .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;3	The party claims the government is trying to tax it into bankruptcy and political death , but authorities accused the PDS of over-simplifying a complex financial issue and of reneging on laws passed by the East German parliament in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;4	PDS leaders began a hunger strike Wednesday afternoon in two government offices in Berlin to protest the tax bill .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;5	Late Wednesday , police removed the protesters , carrying some of them out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;6	The PDS members moved to their party offices at the Berlin city legislature and said the hunger strike would continue indefinitely under the motto `` We wo n't be taxed out of existence -- No expropriation of the PDS . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;7	The Party of Democratic Socialism was formed in 1990 out of the remnants of the collapsed East German Communist Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;8	It got only 2.4 percent of the national vote in December 1990 in the first united German parliamentary elections , and appeared in danger of passing into history .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;9	But in the Oct. 16 national elections , the PDS grabbed 20 percent of votes in eastern Germany and 4.4 percent nationally , mostly on resentment among eastern Germans who feel they are second-class citizens in united Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;10	Chancellor Helmut Kohl attacked the PDS as a group of `` red-painted fascists , '' and the party has been battered by accusations that Gysi was an informant for the East German secret police when he acted as defense lawyer for dissidents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;11	The news magazine Focus this week devoted its cover story to Gysi , calling him `` Der Blender '' -- The Phoney -- and a `` clever demagogue . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;12	The tax levy is for a corporate tax in the first half of 1990 -- before German unification -- when the PDS as successor of the communists still held vast assets around the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;13	East German political groups entrusted their assets to an independent commission that is supposed to determine how much of the property they can keep and how much is national property .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;14	The PDS wanted its tax levy to be paid from its assets held by the independent commission , but the commission refused .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;15	The Treuhandanstalt , the trustee agency that is selling off East German state assets , said the independent commission was following the letter of the 1990 treaty of German unification and a law passed by the democratically elected East German parliament before German unification .
APW_ENG_19941201.0109;16	`` The -LRB- PDS -RRB- is fleeing into the pose of a victim when its active cooperation would be appropriate , '' said Wolf Schoede , spokesman of the trustee agency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;0	China has agreed to allow the United States to open an office of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Beijing , a senior U.S. official announced Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;1	Timothy Wirth , undersecretary of state for global affairs , is in Beijing for talks with Chinese officials on population , environment , women 's issues and narcotics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;2	His job was created under the Clinton administration , and Wirth said he came to China because `` what happens in China is going to affect everybody in the world . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;3	He said the Chinese government had agreed in principle to the opening of the DEA office , and the U.S. side was looking for an apartment for the American official .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;4	Under Chinese government regulations , foreign government employees in Beijing must live in one of four diplomatic compounds , which have long waiting lists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;5	Wirth said U.S. cities are seeing a resurgence of heroin use , with major supplies of `` very cheap and very pure '' heroin from Burma showing up in Los Angeles and New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;6	`` China has the most influence with the government of Burma .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;7	We have very little influence with the government of Burma , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;8	`` We want very much to engage the government of China in focusing on the narcotics problem and the Burma problem in particular . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;9	Southwest China borders Burma .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;10	The `` Golden Triangle '' region where the borders of Burma , Thailand and Laos converge produces most of the world 's heroin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;11	Wirth said China 's population and environmental problems can have worldwide consequences , but China can learn from some of the mistakes the United States has made as well as benefit from its technology and know-how .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;12	For instance , he said , the U.S. experience has shown that use of catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline in cars can substantially improve air quality , one of China 's worst pollution problems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;13	Wirth said he also planned to look into China 's population policies , particularly at a new law promoting mother and child health that includes eugenics clauses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0110;14	`` We remain deeply concerned , as does most of the world , about any programs that involve coercive abortion policies , '' said Wirth , who was to meet with the head of China 's family planning commission on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;0	An explosive thrown during a clash between political rivals killed one person on polling day Thursday , during a state election considered to be a severe test for Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;1	Police said they also killed three militants of the Peoples War Group , an anarchist organization that carried out a series of sabotage incidents in the final weeks of the campaign to disrupt the voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;2	At least 29 people were killed in land mine explosions blamed on the group .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;3	Aruna Bahugana , a senior police officer , reported that an election official was dragged out of his polling booth and stabbed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;4	Cases also were reported of looting ballot boxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;5	The violence came during elections to the state assembly of Andhra Pradesh , Prime Minister Rao 's home state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;6	There were no reports of election trouble in the neighboring state of Karnataka .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;7	Voting for state legislatures in the two south Indian states was seen as an important bellwether for Congress , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;8	A loss in Rao 's own state of Andhra Pradesh could unleash rivalries in the governing party that he suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;9	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for elections in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;10	The voting is staggered to allow police forces to move from one to another to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;11	The Congress campaign in Andhra Pradesh was thrown into disarray by the promise of an aging film star-turned-politician , N.T. Rama Rao , to sell rice to the poor at two rupees per kilogram -LRB- three cents per pound -RRB- -- six times less than the market rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;12	Pursuing free market reforms , Rao could offer no subsidies to match his opponent 's challenge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;13	Rama Rao , 72 , who built a popular image by playing Hindu deities in classic films in the local Telugu language , campaigned with the help of his young crowd-pulling wife , whom he married last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0111;14	The prime minister put his own prestige at stake by campaigning hard in his state , but his party 's prospects were hurt by infighting among the local politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;0	The U.S. dollar put up a mixed performance against other major currencies in early European trading Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;1	Gold prices were down .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;2	In Tokyo , the dollar closed at 99.01 yen , a seven-week high and up 0.03 yen from Wednesday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;3	Later in London , the dollar was quoted at 99.08 yen compared with 98.89 yen late Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;4	Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday : -- 1.5685 German marks , down 1.5686 -- 1.3255 Swiss francs , up from 1.3247 -- 5.3740 French francs , down from 5.3778 -- 1.7570 Dutch guilders , up from 1.7560 -- 1,610.00 Italian lire , down from 1,616.50 -- 1.3755 Canadian dollars , up from 1.3749 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;5	The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.5672 , down from dlrs 1.5673 late Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;6	London 's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of dlrs 381.20 per ounce at midmorning , down from the closing price of dlrs 383 bid per ounce Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;7	In Zurich , the bid price was dlrs 381.10 , down from dlrs 383 late Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;8	In Hong Kong , gold fell dlrs 1.82 to close at a bid dlrs 381.75 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0112;9	Silver traded in London at dlrs 4.92 a troy ounce , down from dlrs 5.04 a troy ounce Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;0	NATO foreign ministers met Thursday to begin laying the groundwork for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;1	But their two-day meeting was likely to be overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia that has put extraordinary strains on the relationship between the United States and its European allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;2	During the talks , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;3	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the European allies , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;4	The change in U.S. policy will help heal an unprecedented rift within the alliance over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;5	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;6	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;7	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;8	The deep splits within the alliance were highlighted by a letter from Germany 's ambassador to NATO that accused the United States of sowing mistrust among the allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;9	The letter from Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen accused the United States of acting behind the backs of its allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;10	`` The alliance is divided and in crisis , '' concluded Richthofen 's cable to his Foreign Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;11	The letter was leaked to a leading German newspaper , the Suddeutsche Zeitung , which published extracts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;12	Opening the meeting , Willy Claes , the new secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , appealed for unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;13	`` We are now being put to -LRB- the -RRB- test , and I have every confidence that our solidarity will see us through now has it has in even darker circumstances . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;14	The foreign ministers are anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;15	They intend to order a study that would set out the terms and conditions for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;16	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' Claes said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;17	The decision to authorize the study will mark a cautious move forward in drawing former adversaries in Eastern Europe who are appealing for membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;18	`` Today , we take an important step in the process that will lead to NATO expansion , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;19	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;20	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;21	Instead , it will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;22	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;23	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis will no doubt occupy a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;24	At a breakfast with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;25	Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;26	Officials said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe may join him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;27	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;28	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0113;29	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .

APW_ENG_19941201.0116;0	Scottish driver David Coulthard , one of the hottest new stars of Formula One racing , has left the Williams Formula One team to sign with rival McLaren , according to British news reports Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0116;1	Williams , however , could still try to block the move , The Times reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0116;2	Coulthard , 23 , emerged as a rising star after he was promoted from test driver following the death of Ayrton Senna .
APW_ENG_19941201.0116;3	He was paired with Damon Hill for the rest of the season until Nigel Mansell returned from the Indy car series to race in the final three races .

APW_ENG_19941201.0118;0	Michael Jackson is trying to end his 5-month-old marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , tabloids in New York and London reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;1	The pop superstar 's manager called the reports `` an outrageous , 100 percent , total lie ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;2	The New York Daily News blamed the alleged breakup on the strain of a bi-coastal relationship , saying Jackson was angered by Presley 's refusal to leave California and live with him in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;3	`` Michael told me they 're splitting , '' the Daily News quoted an unidentified close associate of Jackson as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;4	`` He does n't want to live in California .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;5	He said it 's bad vibes , bad luck for him there . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;6	That contradicted a report in London 's Daily Mirror , which claimed Jackson wanted more space and did n't want his wife tagging along with him to New York , where he keeps an apartment in the luxurious Trump Tower .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;7	Jackson spokesman Lee Solters denied the couple were going separate ways , but acknowledged that he had n't spoken with Jackson recently , the News said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;8	Solters did not return a call to The Associated Press early Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;9	Jackson 's manager , Bob Jones , heatedly denied talk of a split .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;10	`` This is an outrageous , 100 percent , total lie !
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;11	People just do n't want to give these kids a chance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;12	You have my word that this is simply somebody 's sick fantasy , '' Jones said in Thursday 's New York Newsday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;13	In the past , Jones and Solters denied the secret wedding had taken place even weeks after it happened .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;14	`` Michael is here in Chicago , recording with R Kelly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;15	Lisa Marie is in Los Angeles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;16	She can not be with him when he works .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;17	All his energy has to go into his recording .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;18	When he finishes this album , they will be together , '' Jones said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;19	Jackson married Elvis Presley 's daughter last spring in the Dominican Republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;20	At the time , many speculated that the union was a public relations ploy to improve Presley 's singing career and Jackson 's image , which was tarnished by two child-molestation investigations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;21	Prosecutors decided not to press charges .
APW_ENG_19941201.0118;22	J. Randy Taraborelli , who wrote the 1991 biography `` Michael Jackson : the Magic and the Madness , '' told the U.S. television program `` Hard Copy '' that lawyers were already working on nullifying the marriage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;0	The Philippine economy , showing continued improvement , expanded by 5.5 percent in this year 's first nine months from January-September last year , officials reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;1	The National Economic and Development Authority said that in the third quarter alone , gross national product grew by 5.9 percent from a year earlier , compared with 2.2 percent growth in the same period of 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;2	The Economic Planning Agency said the latest quarter 's performance bettered the 5.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter and the 4.9 percent in the first quarter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;3	`` Strong domestic production combined with continued higher net inflows of incomes from abroad led to the accelerated growth during the period , '' the agency said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;4	President Fidel Ramos attributed the growth , after years of sluggish performance , to the liberalization of the economy and other reforms such as breaking up cartels in such sectors as telecommunications , shipping and insurance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;5	He also cited recent moves deregulating foreign exchange trading , opening the banking industry to more foreign banks and improving revenue collection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;6	Ramos said the growth so far indicated that the economy would expand by 5.5 percent for the entire year , with the fourth quarter getting a further boost from good weather and Christmas spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;7	GNP grew by only 2.3 percent in all of 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;8	`` I am very confident of sustainable progress and sustainable development in the long term , '' Ramos said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0119;10	Agriculture , including fishery and forestry , posted an all-time high growth of 9 percent in the third quarter , compared with a 1.4 percent decline in the same quarter last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0119;11	Ramos said the manufacturing sector 's 4.4 percent growth in January-September , compared to its 0.5 percent decline in 1993 , makes it the `` engine for increased output and employment . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;0	A plan to salvage the near-bankrupt airline Iberia appeared doomed Thursday after talks between management and pilots ended in total disagreement over pay cuts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;1	Management and representatives of the carrier 's two main unions reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a plan that entailed a wage freeze , salary cuts averaging 8.5 percent and a reduction of some 3,500 jobs through early retirements and buy-outs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;2	Acceptance by the pilots , who make up 5 percent of the airlines 24,000 employees , would have paved the way for the plan to be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;3	The plan was considered crucial if the European Union is to allow the Spanish government to grant Iberia a 130 billion peseta -LRB- dlrs 1 billion -RRB- capital injection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;4	Iberia chairman Javier Salas said the state-owned company would hold meetings with other unions Thursday to evaluate the situation in view of the pilots ' rejection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;5	Iberia last week touted a more drastic plan that would cut 5,200 jobs and sell company assets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;6	The proposal triggered a one-day strike that paralyzed Spain 's airports and affected more than 100,000 travelers here and abroad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;7	Negotiations with the pilots reached a dead end in overnight talks as Iberia demanded a salary reduction of 15 percent based on 1992 earnings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;8	The pilots insisted that an existing wage agreement through 1995 must be carried out before the 15 percent salary cut could be enforced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;9	`` The company has presented a generic plan that does not guarantee the future of Iberia and only concentrates on disproportionate salary cuts , '' said Armando Guajardo of the pilots ' union SEPLA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;10	SEPLA said the company needed a complete overhaul and not just a reduction in salaries and staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;11	Salas has warned that the company would be technically bankrupt by March 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;12	Iberia has posted losses since 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0120;13	It ended last year 67 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 530 million -RRB- in the red while losses for this year are expected to top 40 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 300 million -RRB- .

APW_ENG_19941201.0121;2	All five people who died had eaten home-smoked fish bought at a local market , Shavdia said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;3	Others fell ill after eating home-canned meat , also from city markets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;4	Power and natural gas shortages in the former Soviet republic have rendered many residents unable to cook at home , forcing them to go to markets for prepared foods .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;5	`` The situation is very difficult , '' Shavdia said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;6	`` We just can not control all the homemade food for sale in the markets and kiosks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;7	Police , who are planning a series of market raids , say they will concentrate on those selling prepared fish or meat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;8	Botulism is a kind of food poisoning , usually caused by bacteria in improperly canned food .
APW_ENG_19941201.0121;9	Modern preserving methods have almost eliminated the disease in most parts of the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;0	Coastal police said they seized two tons of explosives and ammunition from a Chinese fishing boat Thursday and claimed they may have been intended for sabotaging Taiwan 's elections Saturday .

APW_ENG_19941201.0122;3	On Saturday , Taiwan will hold its largest-scale elections to choose a governor , provincial assembly , and mayors and city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung .

APW_ENG_19941201.0122;5	Officials have said China fears possible election victories by the pro-independence opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;6	China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and opposes moves toward Taiwanese independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;7	`` It is the largest amount of ammunition seized in recent years , and we suspect that it may have been meant for use in disturbing social order during the elections , '' Yang Wen-ning , chief of the Tamsui squad , said in an interview .

APW_ENG_19941201.0122;10	They said they left China 's Fujian province Wednesday night and were unaware what the ammunition was for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;11	Taiwanese gangsters have been smuggling small batches of guns and ammunition from China since Taiwan allowed indirect contacts with China in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;12	Most smuggled items are drugs , wine and farm products .
APW_ENG_19941201.0122;13	Taiwan is the seat of the ruling Nationalists who fled the Communist takeover of China in 1949 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0123;4	Major 's spokesman , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Britain had not changed its mind about excluding Sinn Fein from an investment conference in Belfast , despite pressure from American politicians to the contrary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;5	The first talks are expected to concentrate on conditions for Sinn Fein entering into all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;6	British officials have indicated they will press for the IRA to surrender at least some of its weaponry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;7	On Wednesday , Adams and John Hume , Northern Ireland 's most respected politician , issued a statement pressing Britain to begin talking with Sinn Fein .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;8	`` There should be no more stalling , '' they said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;9	A series of meetings and joint statements last year by Adams and Hume , leader of the Catholic-based Social Democratic and Labor Party , helped pave the way for the IRA 's open-ended truce .
APW_ENG_19941201.0123;10	Britain has refused to invite Sinn Fein officials to the foreign investment forum in Belfast on Dec. 13-14 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0124;1	Two people were reported dead from the Italian liner , which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;2	After a night aboard the oil tanker that picked them up , hundreds of passengers began transferring aboard an armada of commercial vessels and two U.S. Navy ships for passage to nearby ports , including Mombasa in Kenya , the Seychelles and Djibouti .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;3	The operation was '' very organized , '' said Cmdr. T. McCreary , spokesman for the U.S. Navy 's Central Command , based in Bahrain . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;4	Folks down there have a pretty good handle on the situation , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;5	The transfer was expected to last most of the day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;6	At mid-morning on Thursday , the empty , scarred Achille Lauro was still afloat , listing badly to port .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;7	White steam nd gray smoke poured from its port side and smaller streams came drifting out of the lower starboard deck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;8	Though her name was still visible on the stern , the cruise ship 's blue and white paint was scorched and mottled , the white stars on her two smokestacks blackened by heat and soot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0124;9	Although crippled , the Achille Lauro appeared in no danger of sinking quickly .

APW_ENG_19941201.0132;2	`` Our people are not chattel , '' the department quoted Raul Rabe , the Philippines ' ambassador in Washington , as saying in a letter to David Angel , Peter Casey , David Lee and Cris Floyd , the Los Angeles-based executive producers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;3	He urged them to `` exert all effort to ensure that this particular feature is not inflicted upon your viewers . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;4	Portions of the show featuring the controversial line had been shown in promotional previews , the department said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;5	It was to have been aired in the United States on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;6	Rabe said the reference to Filipino women `` is not only unfair to a people who have done so much for the United States as its oldest ally in Asia , it diminishes the significant contributions that the large economically upscale Filipino-American community has made to the very fabric of this -LRB- American -RRB- nation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;7	In a separate protest letter to KNBC-Channel 4 in Los Angeles , the Philippine Consulate there said a Philippine law passed in 1991 bans the mail-order bride business and other similar practices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0132;8	It said the episode shows the `` insensitivity and ignorance '' of the writers and `` perpetuates the kind of blindly negative stereotyping of other peoples and cultures reminiscent of a less enlightened period in American television and media . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0133;1	The city government has passed a new law that restricts the hours dogs can go outside , bans them from public areas and imposes stiff fees on their owners , the official press reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;2	The law was proposed in October and has been the subject of intense public debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;3	It also has driven down prices in Beijing 's dog markets , where some sellers are trying to give away puppies for free .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;4	At Beijing 's largest pet store , Pet World , a sales clerk said its last sale was a month ago .

APW_ENG_19941201.0133;13	Beijing newspapers and radio phone-in shows have carried both sides of a debate on whether and how to restrict dogs in the city and its suburbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;14	The proposed law put the registration fee at 6,000 yuan -LRB- dlrs 700 -RRB- , and many people complained it was too high .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;15	The Beijing area has about 190,000 dogs , compared with 20,000 in 1986 , the Xinhua News Agency said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;16	It was not immediately clear how the city would try to enforce the new law .
APW_ENG_19941201.0133;17	Xinhua quoted Zhang Liangji of the Public Security Bureau as saying 52,000 residents were bitten by dogs last year , and 89 people died of rabies between 1988 and 1993 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0137;1	Captain Roberto Luis Trotta booted in a penalty kick to put Velez ahead 1-0 in the 50th minute after Milan goalkeeper Sebastiano Rossi fouled Velez forward Omar Andres Asad in the box .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;2	Asad came back with a goal of his own seven minutes later , intercepting a back pass Milan 's Franco Baresi intended for goalie Rossi and slamming it into the net .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;3	Both sides played a cautious but rough first half marked by three yellow cards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;4	Milan 's Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic , nursing an injured leg , got off a shot just 1:30 into the game , but Milan had only two other shots in the half .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;5	Velez , which had difficulty breaking Milan 's control of the midfield , had only one serious shot on the goal in the first 45 minutes .

APW_ENG_19941201.0137;8	Milan tried to battle back after giving up the two second-half goals , but was unable to turn its several deftly created shooting opportunities into goals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;9	Thursday 's loss was especially disappointing for Milan , which has almost made Tokyo a second home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;10	The Italians represented Europe in the cup for the fifth time last year , narrowly losing to Brazil 's Sao Paulo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;11	Milan has won the Intercontinental Cup , held here since 1980 as the Toyota Cup , three times -- in 1969 , 1989 and 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;12	Milan established itself as one of the world 's top teams under coach Arrigo Sacchi in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0137;13	Since then , the team has won , along with the two Intercontinental Cup titles , four league titles , three Champions Cups and two European SuperCups .

APW_ENG_19941201.0138;1	Assad greeted Mubarak at Damascus Airport and the two drove straight to the Ash-Shaeb , or People 's Palace , for closed-door discussions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;2	Mubarak 's visit came a few days ahead of a scheduled trip to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher , his sixth this year in an effort to break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;3	These have been stalled since February over Syria 's demand that Israel declare its willingness to make a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;4	Israel captured the strategic plateau in southwestern Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;5	Israel has offered a partial withdrawal phased over several years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;6	The Israelis want Assad to agree to a complete normalization of relations , rather than just an end to 46 years of hostilities , and discuss the nature of the peace agreement before addressing the question of the Golan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;7	Mubarak , who has been a key mediator in the three-year-old peace process and is a frequent visitor to Damascus , will also discuss other regional issues with Assad , officials reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;8	Government-run media continued what has become a daily media barrage of criticism of Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;9	Al-Baath , newspaper of the ruling Baath Party , said that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin `` wants to maintain tension and war in the region , disguised as peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0138;10	... He also works to blackmail the U.S.A. ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;0	A Russian ultimatum demanding an end to Chechnya 's civil war expired today amid signs that Moscow was preparing to send troops into the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;1	A trickle of heavily loaded cars and trucks left the capital this morning as nervous civilians continued to head for the countryside , fearing an attack by Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;2	Central Grozny was virtually empty following another nerve-jangling night of intermittent small arms fire from jumpy fighters around the city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;3	A single military jet roared over the capital as the Russian deadline passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;4	Later , heavy machine-gun fire rang out from the city center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;5	The fighting pits forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev , who has declared Chechnya independent from Russia , against rebels whom Dudayev says are armed and led by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;6	Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered warring Chechens to lay down their arms and release all prisoners by this morning or face Russian military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;7	The ultimatum has been met with defiance by Chechens .

APW_ENG_19941201.0141;9	The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;10	The Caucasus region has been especially fractious , with recent fighting in the Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;11	For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;12	No other region has gone as far as Chechnya and declared independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;13	Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslev Kostikov in Moscow said measures to resolve the Chechen conflict had `` begun to be implemented . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0141;14	He did not elaborate .

APW_ENG_19941201.0142;2	The umbilical cord still was attached to the infant girl , believed less than a day old at the time is was handed over Wednesday night in an area near Yokohama , south of Tokyo , Kawana said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0142;3	He said the baby was not even wrapped in a towel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0142;4	The baby now is all right in a hospital , he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0142;5	He did not identify the woman to whom it was passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;0	Overshadowed by the Bosnian crisis , NATO foreign ministers met Thursday to begin laying the groundwork for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;1	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was using the two-day meeting to try to smooth extraordinary strains in U.S.-European ties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;2	He was expected to tell the allies that the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;3	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure particularly from Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;4	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;5	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;6	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;7	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;8	Apart from inevitably dealing with Bosnia , the foreign ministers of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization will move cautiously order a study to set out the terms for letting East European countries join .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;9	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' NATO secretary-general Willy Claes said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;10	The study will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;11	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;12	It will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;13	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;14	On Friday , Christopher intends to lay out the U.S. approach to the Bosnian war in a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and foreign ministers Alain Juppe of France , Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and Klaus Kinkel of Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;15	It centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;16	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;17	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;18	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0143;19	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .

APW_ENG_19941201.0144;0	Overshadowed by the Bosnian crisis , NATO foreign ministers met Thursday to begin laying the groundwork for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;1	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was using the two-day meeting to try to smooth extraordinary strains in U.S.-European ties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;2	He was expected to tell the allies that the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;3	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure particularly from Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;4	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;5	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;6	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;7	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;8	Apart from inevitably dealing with Bosnia , the foreign ministers of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization will move cautiously order a study to set out the terms for letting East European countries join .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;9	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' NATO secretary-general Willy Claes said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;10	The study will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;11	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;12	It will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;13	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;14	On Friday , Christopher intends to lay out the U.S. approach to the Bosnian war in a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and foreign ministers Alain Juppe of France , Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and Klaus Kinkel of Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;15	It centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;16	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;17	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;18	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;19	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;20	Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0144;21	Officials said Juppe may join him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;0	A Japanese seminarian who was reported missing has called his superior , saying he was safe in the central Philippine city of Cebu , another seminarian said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;1	Norihito Sako , 39 , of Sapporo , was reported missing Nov. 20 after failing to return to Manila from a visit to Pampanga province , where he was helping victims of the June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruptions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;2	Fellow seminarian Edgar Zamudio said Sako called the director of the Claret Formation Center , the Rev. Carlos Rivas , Wednesday from Cebu , 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;3	Zamudio said Rivas left for Cebu immediately after receiving the call from Sako and did n't tell the other seminarians why the Japanese went to Cebu .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;4	`` As far as we know , he is in Cebu and he is alive , '' Zamudio said , adding that Sako had visited that city several times previously .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;5	Sako has finished theology studies at Sophia University in Tokyo and belongs to the Diocese of Yokohama .
APW_ENG_19941201.0145;6	In May 1993 , he came to Manila for graduate studies at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Manila University , leading to possible ordination as a priest in 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;0	Indonesia will become an oil importer in the next 20 years as domestic consumption overtakes declining production , the U.S. Embassy said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;1	Petroleum Report , issued annually by the embassy , said domestic consumption could exceed production as soon as the early part of the next decade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;2	The report said Indonesia , which produced an average of 1.5 million barrels of crude oil daily in l993 , lowered its crude exports by 3 percent to 776,000 barrels a day this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;3	Daily consumption of petroleum fuels rose 7 percent to 262 million barrels last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;4	However , the report said oil and gas will continue to play a prominent role in Indonesia 's economy in years to come .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;5	Indonesia , the third oldest oil producer in the world after the United States and Russia , has an estimated 71.86 billion barrels of crude oil reserves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0147;6	Of that amount , 10.41 billion barrels -- 8.09 billion onshore and 2.32 billion offshore -- are proven and probable , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;0	Cpl. Kenneth E. Ruiz , the last of three Marines to be tried in the May 1 stabbing death of a fellow Marine , has been sentenced to life in prison , the U.S. military said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;1	The 23-year-old Ruiz , of Linden , Calif. , was found guilty Wednesday of premeditated murder in the killing of Sgt. Michael A. Allen at Iwakuni Marine Corps Air Station near Hiroshima , a military statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;2	Cpl. Michael R. Stelling of Springfield , Md. , and Lance Cpl. Mark D. Jimenez of Lamont , Calif. , already have been sentenced in the stabbing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;3	Stelling was sentenced to 40 years and Jimenez to 30 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;4	In both cases , the full sentences of life in prison were reduced in line with pre-trial agreements .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;5	Prosecutors at Ruiz ' trial said the three Marines lured Allen to a secluded part of the air station and stabbed him repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;6	They then kicked Allen into a drainage ditch and left him to die , the release said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;7	According to the military newspaper Stars and Stripes , Jimenez testified at his trial that the three killed Allen because they thought he was giving investigators information about a Hispanic gang to which all four Marines belonged .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;8	Prosecutors had called for a life sentence , saying Ruiz was the driving force behind the conspiracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;9	But at the trial Ruiz denied that : `` We all conspired to cover up the murder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0148;10	There were no leaders and no followers , just three idiots who became criminals . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0149;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved an American proposal for a blueprint setting out the terms and conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0149;1	The ministers endorsed a 12-month program to consider financing , structure , nuclear and other issues related to the expansion of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Central and East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0149;2	Anxious not to upset Russia , the foreign ministers , according to an allied source , emphasized that the alliance was `` not trying to create a hostile bloc . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;0	A subsidiary of Japan 's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said Thursday it has agreed to buy German picture tube plants owned by Finland 's Nokia Consumer Electronics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;1	Matsushita Electronics Corp. would not disclose the amount it will pay for Esslingen , Germany-based Nokia Display Technics GmbH , a wholly owned Nokia subsidiary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;2	Nokia announced in March that it would withdraw from the picture-tube business and shut down its Esslingen and Straubing picture-tube facilities by the end of 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;3	Under the agreement , Matsushita Electronics will acquire Nokia Display 's fixed assets , a Matsushita official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;4	Nokia will lay off the current work force at the plants by the end of December , but Matsushita Electronics likely will rehire many of the workers , though it is not obligated to do so under the terms of the deal , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;5	Matsushita said the acquisition is aimed at extending supplies of cathode-ray tubes to Matsushita Group factories and to other television makers in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;6	With the purchase , Matsushita Electronics will have four production bases outside Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;7	Matsushita Electronics is a Japanese maker of semiconductors and cathode-ray tubes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;8	Its shares are n't listed on the nation 's stock exchange .
APW_ENG_19941201.0150;9	Its parent , Matsushita Electric Industrial , is the world 's largest maker of consumer electronics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;0	KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- AP -RRB- - With a brief lull in the civil war , the United Nations is trying to send a large relief convoy into Kabul for the first time in six months , an official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;1	A truck convoy carrying hundreds of tons of food , medicine and plastic sheeting recently left from neighboring Pakistan and is now south of the besieged city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;2	U.N. officials are trying to negotiate safe passage across the front line in south Kabul , said a U.N. official who requested anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;3	Opposition leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar controls the main roads leading into the city and no large convoys can reach Kabul without his approval .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;4	And as winter descends on war-torn Kabul , the food situation is expected to deteriorate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;5	At present , the city 's food is being supplied mostly by small-scale traders who cross the front line daily to buy flour , wood and gasoline from merchants in opposition-held territory to the south and the east of Kabul .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;6	There 's enough food available , but prices have skyrocketed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;7	If the U.N. effort is successful , the convoy could reach Kabul this weekend .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;8	It would be the first U.N. relief convoy to reach the capital since June .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;9	Hekmatyar 's forces tightened their blockade last winter and food supplies were running low until U.N. Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali made a personal appeal to Hekmatyar , who then eased the roadblocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;10	But many Afghans are critical of the United Nations , which removed its international staff from Kabul when heavy fighting erupted in January .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;11	A small staff made up entirely of Afghans now handles the limited U.N. operation in Kabul , while the U.N. 's international staff remains in Pakistan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;12	There were sporadic bursts of gunfire along the front line in southern Kabul on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;13	But compared to the usual salvos of rockets and mortar fire , the city has been relatively peaceful for the last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;14	President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government controls most of the capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0151;15	But nine separate Islamic factions remain locked in a bitter battle that broke out after the groups ousted a Communist government in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0152;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved a proposal setting out the terms and conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0152;1	The ministers endorsed a 12-month program to consider financing , structure , nuclear and other issues related to the expansion of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Central and East European democracies .

APW_ENG_19941201.0153;0	A moderate quake struck the Ionian Sea island of Levkas Thursday , causing some damage but no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;1	The Salonica University Seismological Institute said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.2 and its epicenter on the seabed near Levkas , 300 kilometers -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- southwest of this northern city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;2	It occurred at 9:17 a.m. -LRB- 0717 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;3	It was followed a few minutes later by a quake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;4	Local authorities said some buildings were slightly damaged by the initial tremor , but there were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;5	It was the second quake to hit the Levkas region in two days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;6	A quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 hit the area Tuesday but caused little damage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;7	The region is considered to be earthquake prone .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;8	Officials at the Athens Seismological Institute , located in the capital , said they thought the tremors following Tuesday 's quake to be aftershocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;9	A quake with a moment magnitude of 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally felt by people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0153;10	A magnitude 5 can cause moderate damage while a 6 can cause severe damage under a populated area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0155;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved a proposal setting out the terms and conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0155;1	The ministers endorsed a 12-month program to consider financing , structure , nuclear and other issues related to the expansion of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Central and East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0155;2	Anxious not to upset Russia , the foreign ministers , according to an allied source , emphasized that the alliance was `` not trying to create a hostile bloc . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;0	The decision to support the expansion of the alliance came on the opening day of a two-day conference of allied foreign ministers whose talks were likely to be overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;1	`` Today , we take an important step in the process that will lead to NATO expansion , '' said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in addressing his counterparts at the opening session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;2	`` The United States believes it is time to begin the process -- to begin deliberate consideration of the practical requirements for adding new members to the alliance , '' he said in the text of his speech .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;3	The decision to authorize the study , though , is a cautious move forward in drawing former adversaries anxious for membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;4	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' said NATO Secretary-general Willy Claes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;5	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;6	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0156;7	Instead , it will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure

APW_ENG_19941201.0159;0	President Boris Yeltsin ordered the government to sell a minority stake in Russia 's largest state television and radio company .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;1	The government will keep a controlling 51 percent interest , however .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;2	Ostankino , once called commonwealth television , is broadcast throughout the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;3	Its Moscow broadcasting tower was the scene of the worst fighting during the political uprising in October 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;4	Twelve major companies and organizations are buying the 49 percent stake in Ostankino .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;5	They include ITAR-Tass , Menatep , Stolichny and Inkombank commercial banks , Aeroflot International Airlines and the Avtovaz car manufacturer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;6	Yeltsin 's decree Wednesday said the new venture , called Russian Public Television , would inherit Ostankino 's nationwide Channel One .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;7	Ostankino chief Alexander Yakovlev , who was the architect of `` glasnost '' under former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , told the ITAR-Tass news agency that the sale would help make Russia 's television independent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0159;8	Yeltsin 's opponents have complained that state television favors the government and offers biased coverage of political events -- charges that Russian broadcast executives deny .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;0	In a pre-emptive strike against rival Fox , NBC wants federal regulators to make it easier for U.S. media companies to get financing from foreign investors -- if existing foreign ownership limits are not enforced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;1	`` If the rules on foreign investment and foreign ownership change , then they should change for everyone , not just for Fox , '' NBC said in a petition to the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;2	The FCC , in a separate proceeding , is reviewing whether Fox 's acquisition of six TV stations , using money from a foreign corporation , that made up the foundation of the network violated foreign ownership limits .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;3	The provisions limit a foreign company or individual from owning more than 25 percent of a broadcast station .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;4	NBC says the FCC has not granted any waivers of the limits since their creation 60 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;5	If the agency decides to give Fox a waiver from such restrictions , all broadcast companies should be allowed waivers , Richard Cotton , NBC senior vice president and general counsel , said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;6	The FCC approved the acquisition of those stations from Metromedia Inc. in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;7	The stations are in Washington , New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Dallas and Houston .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;8	The NBC petition builds on a complaint filed earlier this year by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which asserted that Fox violated federal foreign ownership restrictions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;9	According to Fox disclosures to the FCC this summer , all but 1 percent of the dlrs 600 million used to purchase the stations was put up by News Corp. , which is based in Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;10	Chairman Rupert Murdoch , who became a U.S. citizen to buy the stations , owns stock representing 76 percent of the voting rights of Fox Television .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;11	The remaining 24 percent is held by News Corp.
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;12	The key question facing the FCC is who owns the stations -- Murdoch or News Corp.
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;13	But Preston Padden , Fox Broadcasting Co. 's president of network distribution , said it does n't matter because Murdoch controls News Corp. `` It all leads back to a U.S. citizen -- Rupert Murdoch , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;14	Padden said in an interview : `` We do n't have a waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;15	We have n't asked for a waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;16	We do n't intend to ask for a waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;17	We do n't need a waiver . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;18	The ownership of Fox stations complies with the restrictions , Padden said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;19	NBC 's filing -- the latest in a series of assaults against Fox -- is an attempt to sabotage a competitor , Padden asserted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;20	NBC said that if the FCC determines that Fox violated foreign ownership limits , Fox should not be given a waiver from the restrictions unless competitors are also allowed waivers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;21	`` What if we want a foreign partner ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;22	asked one NBC official , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;23	Cotton said NBC 's petition is not motivated by a desire to get an infusion of foreign capital , but to `` level the playing field , '' between NBC and Fox , Cotton said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;24	Cotton and other NBC officials say that the FCC , in an attempt to help nurture a fourth network , has given Fox breaks from broadcast regulations over the last several years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;25	`` Enough is enough , '' Cotton said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0160;26	`` The same rules should apply to all competitors . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;0	Queen Elizabeth II will visit South Africa in March , returning there for the first time since she made her 21st birthday broadcast from Cape Town in 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;1	In a statement on Thursday , Buckingham Palace said the queen and her husband , Prince Philip , will be in South Africa from March 19 to March 25 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;2	As Princess Elizabeth , the queen accompanied her parents , King George VI , who died in 1952 , and Queen Elizabeth , now the 94-year-old Queen Mother , when they visited South Africa in 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;3	She turned 21 in Cape Town and broadcast from there dedicating herself to the service of Britain and now 51-nation Commonwealth of its ex-colonies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;4	As international hostility grew to apartheid , no British sovereign visited South Africa after 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;5	Philip represented the queen at the installation of President Nelson Mandela , South Africa 's first black president , in April .
APW_ENG_19941201.0161;6	The queen 's daughter , Princess Anne , was there Nov. 22-Nov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0163;0	The death toll from Mount Merapi 's eruption last week has risen to 52 , with many more deaths expected among the 29 victims in critical condition , an official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0163;1	Bambang Pramudia , an official at the Sardjito hospital in Jogjakarta , said little could be done for those badly burned by a cloud of steam and gas that spewed suddenly from the 2,968-meter -LRB- 7,952-foot -RRB- volcano on Nov. 22 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0163;2	`` Those who do survive will need major plastic surgery for burns , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0163;3	The volcano 's activity has begun to show signs of subsiding , said Atje Purbawinata of Jogjakarta 's geology office , but villagers have been told to stay at emergency shelters until the situation was really safe .

APW_ENG_19941201.0165;0	The first international political summit on AIDS opened Thursday with appeals to governments to protect victims ' dignity and provide more money to combat the disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;1	`` I am issuing a general call to arms , '' U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told officials from 42 nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;2	`` We are not meeting here simply to issue a further warning , but to declare a planetary emergency ... Every day , AIDS kills children , destroys families , drains economies , threatens communities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;3	We must act without delays . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;4	Twelve prime ministers , 17 health ministers and other Cabinet officials met to strengthen political commitments to fight AIDS and expand cooperation between developed and developing nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;5	A non-binding declaration to be signed Thursday evening pledges to promote international cooperation in research , partnerships between public and private sectors and increased safeguards for blood transfusions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;6	Participants will vow to reach out to children and `` empower women ... to reduce their vulnerability '' by engaging them more in policy-making .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;7	The summit was one of the focal points of World AIDS Day , being observed around the world with education programs and fund-raising events .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;8	Australians attended special church services in memory of the 3,500 compatriots killed by AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;9	In South Africa , where the disease is spreading rapidly , health officials and politicians wrapped a huge red ribbon around St. George 's Cathedral in Cape Town as part of efforts to increase awareness about AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;10	In China , a group with no government ties took to Beijing streets to distribute pamphlets about AIDS prevention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;11	It 's rare for an independent group to be allowed to organize high-profile public activities such as passing out leaflets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;12	Federico Mayor , head of the U.N. Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization where the one-day Paris summit was held , said nations must spend more to fight AIDS rather than rely on private charities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;13	`` In our budgets we have funds to pay the price of war , but we have made no provision for the cost of the fight against AIDS , '' Mayor said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;14	Boosted spending `` must be accompanied by ethical surveillance to prevent or check any measures -- including legislative ones -- that would tend to exclude or discriminate against people who are ill from the disease , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;15	Respect for AIDS sufferers was a common theme at the summit , attended by several AIDS activist groups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;16	`` To us on the front lines , people living with HIV and AIDS and affected and vulnerable communities must have the right to assemble and form associations to fight the epidemic , '' said Richard Burzynski , an HIV sufferer with the AIDS rights group Icaso .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;17	`` This means that all laws which deny the freedom of people to cross borders because of HIV must be abolished , '' Burzynski said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;18	`` This means all laws which criminalize or discriminate against homosexuals , drug users , migrants and refugees , and sex workers must be abolished . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;19	Governments tend to ignore or marginalize sexual minorities , worsening rather than addressing the AIDS epidemic , said the International Gay and Lesbian Association .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;20	High-risk populations must be accepted and educated , the association said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;21	The World Bank , the world 's biggest donor in the campaign against AIDS , Thursday pledged dlrs 150 million annually to combat the disease in developing countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;22	The bank , which has already extended dlrs 600 million to anti-AIDS projects , mostly in the Third World , said the new aid would be in the form of low-interest , 40-year loans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;23	France recently announced it would increase its aid to international agencies that fight AIDS by more than tenfold to 132 million francs -LRB- dlrs 25 million . -RRB-
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;24	Currently , however , more than 90 percent of the money pledged to fight AIDS goes toward helping only the 8 percent of those afflicted in developed countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;25	Some 17 million people are known to have been infected with the HIV virus , about two-thirds in Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;26	Elements of the French media pronounced the summit a failure even before it began .
APW_ENG_19941201.0165;27	The daily Liberation criticized the final declaration as `` banal , '' predicted that little new funding would be generated , and said the French were rebuffed in efforts to lure U.S. Vice President Al Gore , British Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the summit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;0	When it comes to having fun , the Irish are still Number One in the European Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;1	But what 's more , they are getting better at enjoying themselves than other Europeans , the EU statistics agency Eurostat said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;2	It issued figures showing the Irish -- who topped the fun meter in the 1980s -- continue to outspend the rest on entertainment , recreation , education and culture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;3	The average Irish household devotes 12.1 percent of its consumer spending on these four areas `` that could loosely be described as the ` fun index ' , '' said Eurostat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;4	In the second half of the 1980s , the Irish scored 10.6 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;5	On the latest index , Britons are second -- at 10.2 percent , barely up from 9.5 -- followed by the Dutch and Danes , both virtually unchanged at 10.1 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;6	Across the 12-nation EU , the 380,000 Luxembourgers have the least good time , devoting only 4.1 percent of their consumer spending to things considered fun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;7	The Eurostat figures are part of wider survey into consumer spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;8	Without giving a margin or error , it reports figures for 1992 which show that :
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;9	- Italians spend most on clothes and shoes -LRB- 9.9 percent of their total consumer outlays -RRB- and the Danes least -LRB- 5.3 percent -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;10	- Germans spend most on cars -LRB- 5.4 percent -RRB- and the Irish least -LRB- 3.3 percent -RRB- -- EU citizens ' spending on food , beverages and tobacco is dropping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;11	The average per EU household has gone to 19.1 percent of spending , down from 20.8 percent in the 1985-89 period .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;12	The Greeks top this department .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;13	Up to 36.7 percent of their consumer spending goes to food , drink and a smoke `` but the Irish are n't far behind -LRB- 34.8 percent -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;14	Third are the Portuguese -LRB- 33.6 percent -RRB- with the British -LRB- 21.6 percent -RRB- next . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;15	Eurostat reported these consumer spending scores of its ` fun index ' of entertainment , recreation , education and culture -LRB- with the 1985-1989 in brackets -RRB- :
APW_ENG_19941201.0166;16	Ireland , 12.1 percent -LRB- 10.6 percent -RRB- ; Britain , 10.2 -LRB- 9.5 -RRB- ; Denmark , 10.1 -LRB- 9,8 -RRB- ; Netherlands , 10.1 -LRB- unchanged -RRB- ; Germany , 9.4 -LRB- 9.0 -RRB- ; Italy , 8.8 -LRB- 8.6 -RRB- ; Belgium , 8.7 percent -LRB- 8.4 -RRB- ; France , 7.6 -LRB- 7.3 -RRB- ; Portugal , 7.1 -LRB- 5.9 -RRB- Spain , 6.6 -LRB- unchanged -RRB- ; Greece , 5.6 -LRB- 6.0 -RRB- and Luxembourg , 4.1 -LRB- 3.9 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;0	Russian officials have registered apprehension about the movement of NATO 's territory farther east , and alliance leaders have gone out of their way to try to strengthen separate ties with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;1	`` Russia is a part of Europe , '' said the NATO source , who insisted on anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;2	`` You can not have a security system without the participation of Russia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;3	The ministers , he said , emphasized the importance of `` increasing the momentum '' of consultations between NATO and Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;4	The United States had initially proposed a six-month study of enlargement , but the Europeans , mindful of Moscow 's concerns , extended it to 12 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;5	`` We should avoid premature enlargement that gives the impression that we seek a redivision of the European continent , '' said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , according to a spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;6	The allies do not intend to identify candidates for membership , nor set a date for admission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;7	But the NATO source said , `` Central European states would be first . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;8	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;9	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis will no doubt occupy a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;10	During the talks , Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;11	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the European allies , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;12	The change in U.S. policy will help heal an unprecedented rift within the alliance over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;13	At a breakfast with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;14	Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;15	Officials said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe may join him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;16	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;17	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;18	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;19	On Friday , Christopher will meet with here his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;20	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0167;21	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;0	He was a caring corner grocer , a Korean immigrant and church deacon who gave advice to neighborhood boys and organized an anti-crime petition drive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;1	Then Moon Hwang went from crusader to victim : Police say he was beaten to death behind his one-story brick store by a gang of teen-agers out for money .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;2	They did n't know he carried none .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;3	Their take : two loaves of bread and a bag of bean sprouts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;4	Eighteen-year-old Richard Simons and six juveniles , all members of a gang that called itself the Black Gangsta Family , have been charged with murder , robbery and conspiracy in the Nov. 18 attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;5	Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz said Wednesday that he would seek to try the juveniles as adults .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;6	Police said the assailants used a BB gun to shoot out a light that illuminated the gravel-and-dirt parking lot behind the store .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;7	When Hwang and his wife closed the store about 8 p.m. and headed to their car , police said , the youths attacked in the darkness .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;8	Hwang 's wife , Young , ran for help and escaped unhurt .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;9	Hwang , beaten over the head , died two days later .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;10	Police were n't sure what the murder weapon was .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;11	Hwang , 54 , had no money because he timed his deposits to avoid carrying cash at dangerous times , police said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;12	One of the juveniles also is charged with killing a 15-year-old girl less than a day later .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;13	Le-Ann Washington was shot in the forehead from point-blank range after arguing with the youth as she walked home from a mall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;14	On Wednesday , Bolf 's Market was still closed , the neon `` Fresh Fruit , Produce '' sign still lit , the newspapers inside now almost 2 weeks old .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;15	Neighbors in this working-class community of 16,000 people 5 miles -LRB- eight kilometers -RRB- west of Atlantic City fondly remembered a man who cared about his customers and stuck to his principles , refusing to sell cigarettes and condoms to minors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;16	`` He would have father-and-son talks with the younger customers who came in , '' said Patrick Lee , a liquor store owner who met Hwang through the Korean Chamber of Commerce of Atlantic County , which Hwang founded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;17	`` He cared about local children and how they acted , '' Lee said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;18	`` He 'd say , ` You should n't do this ' and ` You should n't do that . '' '
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;19	Hwang cared about his fellow merchants , too .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;20	In October , he sent a letter and a petition with 55 signatures to the Atlantic City police chief listing four violent incidents , including the Oct. 15 killing of a convenience store worker in Atlantic City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;21	Later , he met with Atlantic City police officials and persuaded them to patrol Korean-owned stores more frequently .
APW_ENG_19941201.0168;22	His motives were far from selfish -- his store is in Pleasantville .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;0	Conservatives ' hopes of avoiding a potentially destructive duel between their top presidential hopefuls were dashed Thursday by a parliamentary report saying a primary could not be organized before the April election .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;1	The report by a 36-member legislative commission increased the chances that Premier Edouard Balladur and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac will compete for conservative votes all the way into first-round presidential voting on April 23 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;2	They are likely to be joined by a candidate from the center-right Union for French Democracy , as well as far-right and far-left candidates and the probable Socialist Party candidate , Jacques Delors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;3	A two-candidate runoff on May 7 will determine the successor to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;4	Many conservatives fear that the bitter infighting between Balladur and Chirac , both members of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic , will ensure Delors ' victory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;5	Delors , who steps down next month as chief executive of the European Union , has pulled ahead in recent opinion polls .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;6	The parliament commission , composed of lawmakers from both main conservative parties , said it would be impossible to organize a primary that would satisfy all candidates and produce broadly accepted results .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;7	`` In the absence of any legislation ... it would inevitably give rise to endless challenges and uncontrollable arguments , '' the commission 's report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;8	`` The result on public opinion would be disastrous , and the winner 's legitimacy would be seriously affected . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;9	The commission had studied the feasibility of drafting a primary law or of arranging a primary without legislation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;10	It examined problems related to voter lists , financing and access to the media .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;11	Given the unfeasibility of a primary , the right 's prospects for success `` depend on the willingness of the candidates to endorse unity and guarantee it publicly , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;12	Interior Minister Charles Pasqua had been struggling in recent weeks to lay the ground work for a primary , but said Thursday the problem now lay with the political parties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;13	One of Pasqua 's allies , Parliament member Jean-Jacques Guillet , denounced the commission report as `` an assassination '' arranged in advance by those who opposed the idea of a primary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0169;14	Balladur , who has yet to officially declare his candidacy , said after learning of the report that it remained essential for the right to find a candidate who could unify all factions of the governing coalition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;0	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;1	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;2	Instead , it will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;3	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;4	Russian officials have registered apprehension about the movement of NATO 's territory farther east , and alliance leaders have gone out of their way to try to strengthen separate ties with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0170;5	`` Russia is a part of Europe , '' said the NATO source , who insisted on anonymity .

APW_ENG_19941201.0171;0	Hyatt International Corporation on Thursday signed an agreement with the Greek state to build and operate a casino , a five-star hotel and conference center in Salonica , northern Greece .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;1	The casino , which will be able to seat 2,000 people at a time , is expected to be completed by mid-1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;2	The 150-room hotel and conference center are expected to be completed the following year .

APW_ENG_19941201.0171;4	The hotel and conference hall will be a five-minute drive away , on the grounds of the city 's American Farm School .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;5	The chairman of Hyatt 's board , Jay A. Pritzker , said he expected the total investment to come to about dlrs 120 million or dlrs 125 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;6	This includes 7.8 billion drachmas -LRB- dlrs 33 million -RRB- paid up front as a license fee that will come to 1.2 billion drachmas -LRB- dlrs 5 million -RRB- annually .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;7	The state will also receive 30 percent of the casino 's revenues .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;8	The license has a 12-year exclusivity period and is of indefinite duration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;9	Hyatt is also bidding for a license to operate a casino in Athens , Pritzker told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;10	`` We hope to expand and build more of these projects in Greece , '' he said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0171;13	`` This is a very important project for Hyatt and the U.S. economic relationship with Greece and for the region for where the project is going , '' Niles said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0171;14	`` The area of northern Greece has an enormous opportunity to become a major transport , telecommunications and economic center of this region , that would include the countries of the southern Balkans , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0172;0	The EU executive Commission said Thursday it will approve plans by France 's Chanel SA for a watch retail network after the fashion and luxury goods maker agreed to change its distribution rules .
APW_ENG_19941201.0172;1	In a statement in the EU Official Journal , it said Chanel has agreed , among others , to drop plans to grant retailers `` exclusive '' market rights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0172;2	Under EU rules , Chanel 's competitors have a month to comment on the Commission 's decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;0	Svetla Dimitrova , the European champion in the 100-meter hurdles , has been suspended by the Bulgarian Athletics Federation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;1	Federation chairman Plamen Krastev said Thursday that Dimitrova was sanctioned because she had left Bulgaria for Austria without leaving the federation an address where she could be reached .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;2	Austrian track officials said they had seen Dimitrova training in Vienna several weeks ago but had no other details on her whereabouts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;3	`` We are sending a message to the International Amateur Athletic Federation that Dimitrova is suspended , '' Krastev said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;4	`` According to IAAF rules , we have to know at any moment the place where our athletes can be reached . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;5	IAAF spokesman Christopher Winner said the Bulgarians appeared to be referring to an IAAF `` guideline '' which recommends that a national federation know the whereabouts of an athlete for possible random drug tests .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;6	`` The IAAF is not involved in what appears to be an internal disagreement between the federation and the athlete , '' Winner said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;7	Krastev said Dimitrova , 24 , is in the process of getting divorced from her trainer , Ilian Pishtikov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;8	Pishtikov told Bulgarian newspapers that Dimitrova had been enticed to go to Vienna by her Austrian manager , Harald Edletzberger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;9	Several years ago , Edletzberger invited another Bulgarian top athlete , Lyudmila Ninova , who left Bulgaria and now lives in Austria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;10	`` This man -LRB- Edletzberger -RRB- is trying to make money from the results of our years-long hard training , '' Pishtikov said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;11	`` The Bulgarian Athletics Federation has informed the IAAF that it does n't want any more its athletes to be represented by Harald Edletzberger , '' Krastev said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0173;12	Dimitrova won seven races on the Mobil Grand Prix circuit this year and finished second in the overall standings behind Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;0	A Russian ultimatum demanding an end to Chechnya 's civil war expired early Thursday amid signs that Moscow was preparing to send troops into the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;1	A trickle of heavily loaded cars and trucks left the capital as nervous civilians continued to head for the countryside , fearing an attack by Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;2	Central Grozny was virtually empty following another nerve-jangling night of intermittent small arms fire from jumpy fighters around the city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;3	A single military jet roared over the capital as the Russian deadline passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;4	Later , heavy machine-gun fire rang out from the city center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;5	The fighting pits forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who has declared Chechnya independent from Russia , against rebels who Dudayev says are armed and led by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;6	President Boris Yeltsin ordered warring Chechens to lay down their arms and release all prisoners by Thursday morning or face Russian military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;7	Chechens have defied the ultimatum .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;8	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;9	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots , danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;10	Russian media reported troop movements around the borders of Chechnya , in the Caucasus Mountains region of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;11	The Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said Russian army units would support Interior Ministry forces to `` ensure stability in the region , safety of the population and avert the spread of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;12	The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;13	The Caucasus region has been especially fractious , with fighting in the Ossetian and Abkhazian regions of Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;14	For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;15	No other region has gone as far as Chechnya and declared independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;16	Moscow openly supports Dudayev 's opponents politically , but denies offering military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;17	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters Saturday , Moscow said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;18	In Moscow , Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslev Kostikov said Moscow had begun `` a series of measures '' to resolve the crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;19	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' he said , referring to those captured on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;20	He did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;21	Most of those fleeing Grozny went only a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- to stay with relatives in the countryside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;22	`` Already , the majority of people have left the city , '' said 43-year-old Lyuba Ishkirchira , a Russian woman married to an ethnic Bashkir .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;23	`` I have no relatives to go to , and my father and mother are ill here -- I can not leave them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;24	Grozny 's central bazaar , which once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;25	A few old women trudged through the mud and wet leaves in search of bread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;26	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : Distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;27	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said one restaurant owner who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;28	Wrapped in an old leather coat and a thick , gray scarf , a 60-year-old Chechen woman walking among the bazaar 's empty stalls said Russia would have a tough time trying to overrun Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0174;29	`` Whoever fights the Muslims never wins , '' Tamara Ofsayeva said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;0	Bebeto is laid up with a bad cold and Romario 's hair is falling out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;1	As Deportivo de La Coruna and Barcelona prepare for a titans ' battle Saturday , their respective Brazilian aces are ailing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;2	The match is vital for both teams .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;3	Deportivo , with 18 points , lies behind leader Real Madrid on goal difference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;4	Barcelona , the four-year defending champion , is two points back at No. 4 and still smarting from its first defeat at home in 10 months against Sevilla last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;5	That result followed the humiliating defeat by Turkey 's Galatasaray in European Champions League play which left Barcelona 's path to the cup 's quarterfinals in danger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;6	Both Deportivo and Barcelona place much stock in their respective Brazilian World Cup aces , Bebeto and Romario .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;7	But on Saturday Deportivo at least will be without its top striker who was Wednesday ordered to stay indoors for at least two weeks while antibiotics work on a chest cold .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;8	The news was welcomed by Barcelona goalkeeper Carlos Busquets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;9	`` Bebeto is a magnificent player and it 's one less problem for us , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;10	But while Barcelona 's star Romario is likely to be physically fit for the game , he told a Brazilian daily this week that life at the top is wasting him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;11	`` It 's now that I 'm feeling the pressure of the responsibility I took on in the U.S. -LRB- World Cup -RRB- , '' Romario told the Journal de Brasil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;12	`` I promised to win a fourth world title for Brazil and that brought a lot of pressure on me .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;13	I 'm stressed out . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;14	`` The worst part is that there 's nothing I can do ... my hair is falling out non-stop , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;15	Romario , the league 's top scorer last season with 30 goals , has only managed to score three in 12 rounds so far , nine less than he had at the same point last season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;16	But under stress or not , Romario like his other teammates still had to endure a training session Wednesday reported to have been the longest and most excruciating since coach Johan Cruyff took over Barcelona .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;17	Cruyff is undoubtedly aware that although it is early days yet a defeat Saturday could allow Real Madrid and Deportivo to steal ahead and seriously impair Barcelona 's chances of winning a fifth title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;18	Madrid on Saturday travels north to play a Real Sociedad struggling at No. 17 in the 20-team division and still recovering from the sacking of long-time coach Welshman John Toshack last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;19	While Madrid 's three defeats so far this season have been in away games , Sociedad has only managed to win one game at home out of six .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;20	One club likely to be hoping Madrid , Deportivo and Barcelona all trip up is No. 3 Zaragoza which lies a point behind the leaders going into its bout Sunday against No. 12 Sporting de Gijon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;21	Saturday sees two other first division games with Athletic de Bilbao traveling to Atletico de Madrid and Valencia hosting Albacete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0175;22	Other 13th-round games Sunday are : Oviedo-Betis ; Valladolid-Celta ; Tenerife-Logrones ; Compostela-Racing de Santander and Sevilla-Espanol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;0	Russian prisons are inhuman and torturous , with underfed inmates crammed into stinking , standing-room-only cells , a U.N. report said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;1	It said conditions in pre-trial remand centers -- where first time offenders accused of petty crimes may wait for five years for a court appearance -- were even worse than labor camps for hardened convicts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;2	`` The oppressive heat , lack of oxygen , and the odors of sweat , excrement and disease created by gross overcrowding are overpowering , '' said Nigel Rodley , the author of the report and the U.N. 's special investigator on torture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;3	At the invitation of the Russian government , Rodley spent two weeks in the Moscow and St. Petersburg area in summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;4	He visited four remand centers , two police headquarters , one labor camp , one juvenile center and one hospital for seriously ill prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;5	The Russian government estimates there are 500,000 prisoners in about 528 prisons and penal colonies throughout the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;6	Russia has the highest rate of detentions in the world , above the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;7	Rodley , a British human rights expert , said the rocketing crime rate following the end of Communist control had worsened acute overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;8	He criticized Russian authorities for trying to respond to public concern about crime by throwing petty offenders into jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;9	He recommended that President Boris Yeltsin should issue a presidential decree to release 71,000 non-violent , first-time offenders to try to ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;10	`` It 's a radical proposal because it 's a radical problem which needs to be addressed urgently , '' Rodley told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;11	He said beatings and maltreatment were widespread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;12	Rodley said even reading accounts of atrocious conditions did not prepare him for the appalling reality .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;13	`` The conditions are cruel , inhuman and degrading ; they are torturous , '' he wrote about cells in Moscow 's notorious Butryskaya prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;14	`` There is virtually no daylight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;15	There is insufficient room for everyone to lie down , sit down or even stand up at the same time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;16	Butryrskaya prison was constructed in 1771 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;17	There has been very little refurbishment since then .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;18	Built for 3,500 prisoners , it now holds 6,300 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;19	`` The food , not always available because of the indebtedness of the institutions -- is primitive , of a fat-saturated soupy nature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;20	It is consumed in the cell and is excreted in the cell , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;21	In another Moscow detention center , Matrosskaya Tishina No. 1 , conditions in quarantine cells for sick prisoners were atrocious .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;22	`` Despite the fact that several of the inmates had open , festering sores , severe fungal infections with decaying flesh , and extensive rashes , they reported that they had not seen a doctor in over a week , '' Rodley wrote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;23	He said conditions at a high-security labor camp he visited were better than those in the pre-trial remand centers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;24	He said the main problem seemed to be boredom among inmates because the economic crisis meant factories on the camp were not operational .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;25	He said a labor colony for young criminals he visited was humanely run .
APW_ENG_19941201.0176;26	However , he was surprised to find 15 and 16 year-olds there sentenced to several years for stealing a bicycle or computer fraud .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;0	A team from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Cairo on Thursday to evaluate Egypt 's progress in implementing its economic reform program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;1	Relations between Egypt and the Washington-headquartered organization have been strained over IMF demands that Egypt devalue its currency and lower interest rates to boost economic growth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;2	The government -- backed by many in the business community -- opposes devaluation , saying it will damage the nation 's already troubled export effort and worsen inflation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;3	The pound currently is trading at about 3.38 to the dollar , and consumer prices have been rising despite efforts to hold inflation below 10 percent this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;4	Sources close to the talks said they expected the IMF team to put the contentious issues aside for the time being and concentrate on structural problems , such as Egypt 's export policies , customs regulations , tax system , and anti-inflation program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;5	The team , headed by IMF Associate Director Saleh Nasouli , is to stay until Dec. 19 to review the extended credit facility approved in 1991 , IMF officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;6	The disagreement has held up action by the so-called Paris Club of Western donor nations , which has pledged to write off some dlrs 4 billion of Egyptian debt once the nation has fulfilled its promises to the IMF .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;7	The debt write-off had been expected in June 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;8	The delay is costing Egypt some dlrs 350 million a year in interest payments , analysts say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;9	Egypt also is at odds with the World Bank over the slow speed of privatizing dozens of government-owned companies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0177;10	Some 314 companies have been reorganized under holding companies to prepare them for sale , but only a handful have been sold .

APW_ENG_19941201.0179;0	Former NBA player Rolando Blackman has signed with AEK Athens after being released by the New York Knicks , the Greek club 's president said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0179;1	Blackman signed the one-year dlrs 400,000 contract in the United States last week and it was announced in Athens , Michalis Lefakis said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0179;2	The 1.98-meter -LRB- 6-foot-6 -RRB- shooting guard spent the last two seasons with the Knicks after 11 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks .

APW_ENG_19941201.0179;4	Blackman became a free agent in July when the Knicks declined to renew his contract .
APW_ENG_19941201.0179;5	He averaged a career-low 7.3 points in 55 games last season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0179;6	Over 13 seasons in the NBA he averaged 18.0 points .

APW_ENG_19941201.0184;0	Japan 's former telecommunications monopoly announced pay cuts Thursday for five executives to take moral responsibility for a colleague 's alleged acceptance of bribes to influence purchasing contracts .

APW_ENG_19941201.0185;0	Pope John Paul II repeated his desire to visit Israeli during a meeting Thursday with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , but he again declined to commit himself to a date , Vatican officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;1	The pope and Peres met for 30 minutes , with the Israeli renewing a long-standing invitation for a visit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;2	A Vatican statement said they discussed issues linked to the Middle East peace process , including relations with Palestinians , Lebanon and the '' future '' of Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;3	On Jerusalem , a city holy to Jews , Christians and Muslims , the Vatican has insisted that access to religious sites be assured through international guarantees .
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;4	In a television interview broadcast by an Italian religious station earlier this week , Peres re-affirmed the Israeli position that Jerusalem will always be Israel 's capital and that politically the issue was closed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;5	But Peres said '' if we are talking about religious issues , we are ready to listen . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0185;6	Earlier , Peres presented his book '' The New Middle East , '' which has come out in Italian , to an audience of Italians and Israeli officials .

APW_ENG_19941201.0188;1	`` We are n't a very well-known team yet , but it 's not the past that matters , '' Velez coach Carlos Bianchi said after winning the match to decide the world 's top club .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;2	`` It 's the present , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;3	`` We proved we are a team that deserves this honor . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;4	Captain Roberto Luis Trotta booted in a penalty kick to put Velez ahead 1-0 in the 50th minute after Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta fouled forward Omar Andres Asad in the box .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;5	Milan keeper Sebastiano Rossi then picked up a yellow card for bickering with the referee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;6	Asad came back with a goal of his own seven minutes later , intercepting a back pass Milan 's Franco Baresi intended for goalie Rossi and slamming it into the net before nearly 48,000 spectators at Tokyo 's National stadium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;7	`` I ca n't believe we lost , '' said Milan coach Fabio Capello .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;8	`` But the team that makes mistakes loses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;9	That 's soccer . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;10	Both sides played a cautious but rough first half marked by three yellow cards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;11	Milan 's Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic , nursing an injured leg , got off a shot just 1:30 into the game , but Milan had only two other shots in the half .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;12	Velez , which had difficulty breaking Milan 's control of the midfield , had only one serious shot on the goal in the first 45 minutes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;13	Forwards Asad and Jose Oscar Flores , however , provided some excitement with dangerous breaks down the sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;14	`` Not very many of our players have experience in the big international games like this , so we were very nervous , '' said Asad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;15	`` But we got over that as the game went on . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;16	Milan tried to battle back after giving up the two second-half goals , but was unable to turn its several deftly created shooting opportunities into goals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;17	Milan outshot Velez 11-6 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;18	Thursday 's loss was especially disappointing for Milan , which has almost made Tokyo a second home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;19	The Italians represented Europe in the cup for the fifth time last year , narrowly losing to Brazil 's Sao Paulo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;20	Milan has won the Intercontinental Cup , held here since 1980 as the Toyota Cup , three times -- in 1969 , 1989 and 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;21	Milan established itself as one of the world 's top teams under coach Arrigo Sacchi in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;22	Since then , the team has won , along with the two Intercontinental Cup titles , four league titles , three Champions Cups and two European SuperCups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;23	But it has been struggling through this season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;24	Milan has already been eliminated from the Italian Cup and is on the brink of being knocked from the Champions League .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;25	The young Argentinian team -- their starters ' average age was 25 compared with 29 for Milan -- currently co-leads its domestic league with River Plate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;26	It defeated Sao Paulo in the Liberators ' Cup in August to win its berth in Thursday 's game .
APW_ENG_19941201.0188;27	`` I think this will be one of the games that I look back on after I retire , '' said Velez midfielder Roberto Fabian Pompei .

APW_ENG_19941201.0189;0	Aetna International Inc. 's application to form a joint venture insurance company in China is still pending , but Aetna President Michael A. Stephen was optimistic that his company would enter the Chinese market .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;1	Aetna International , a part of Aetna Life and Casualty of the United States , applied in May to form a Shanghai joint venture insurance company with China Pacific Insurance Co.
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;2	If approved , Aetna would become only the third foreign insurer allowed an operating presence in China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;3	Stephen said Thursday he has not been given any indication of the application 's fate , but added that he was `` basically optimistic '' about his company 's prospects in the world 's most populous nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;4	`` We 're continuing to be patient and to build relationships as we position ourselves to be active players when the markets open up , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;5	Both Stephen and Douglas Henck , senior vice president for Asia Pacific operations at Aetna International , felt Chinese authorities understood the need to reform and open the country 's financial services sector but still were gathering information before making a decisive move .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;6	`` If China wants to play a full role in the world , it has to reform several of its industries and the financial services industry is one , '' said Stephen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;7	The People 's Insurance Co. of China now has a 98 percent share of China 's insurance market .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;8	Neither of the Aetna executives saw the opening of financial markets as a threat to the Chinese company .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;9	While it might lose market share to foreign companies or joint ventures , the total market will grow and PICC 's revenues will increase , they said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;10	In Taiwan , Stephen said , Aetna became the first foreign company to receive an unrestricted license to sell life insurance in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;11	Although the major Taiwanese life insurer lost about 5 percentage points of its then 60 percent market share , it benefited along with Aetna from overall market growth , he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;12	`` It 's important to remember that Asian insurance markets are n't mature , '' said Stephen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;13	Unlike the U.S. or some European markets , Asian countries still have plenty of room for expansion , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;14	Another possibility is the privatization of state pension funds , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0189;15	Although Chinese officials did n't indicate they were contemplating such a move , Stephen said he thought this was an area in which Aetna 's expertise could make a real contribution to China 's welfare .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;0	Australia 's devastating drought will cut economic growth by nearly 1 percent , bump up food prices and more than halve production of winter crops , a top official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;1	Primary Industries Minister Bob Collins also delivered more bad news for farmers , saying there was little chance the drought would break this summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;2	The drought will cause national income to fall by dlrs 2.9 billion -LRB- dlrs US 2.2 billion -RRB- this year , equivalent to a 0.7 percent drop in economic growth , now running at more than 6 percent a year , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;3	Winter crop yields are expected to plummet by 54 percent to 13 million tons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;4	Earlier forecasts had predicted a 40 percent reduction to around 17 million tons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;5	Wheat production is expected to drop by more than 50 percent to its lowest level since 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0191;6	`` These figures provide a stark illustration of the economic impact of this drought and I regret to say it shows no sign of breaking , '' Collins told Parliament .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;0	British officials will meet the IRA 's allies in Sinn Fein next week , the first official face-to-face contact between the two sides since the IRA cease-fire , the government announced Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;1	The first meeting was proposed for Wednesday in Belfast , but the time and location has not been set , said a spokesman at Prime Minister John Major 's office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;2	The announcement came three months to the day after the IRA began observing a cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;3	That cease-fire has been marred only by the murder of a postal worker in a robbery carried out by IRA members on Nov. 10 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;4	British officials have said they will be pressing for a surrender of IRA weapons , but Sinn Fein argues that this is impossible before reaching an overall political settlement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;5	`` How we will take the gun out of Irish politics is by bringing forward agreement on political structures , '' said Sinn Fein 's Northern Ireland chairman , Mitchel McLaughlin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;6	`` Those who are talking surrender terms are being unrealistic , and I think are playing dangerous games with what is a genuine opportunity for peace in Ireland . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;7	But John Taylor , a member of the Ulster Unionist Party , Northern Ireland 's largest party , said : `` No one can enter into meaningful political talks , and carry the threat of renewed violence under the table . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;8	Britain will be represented by Quentin Thomas , an official in the Northern Ireland Office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;9	Sinn Fein said Martin McGuinness , the party 's second-ranking leader , will head its delegation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;10	Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams will be in Washington next week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;11	The White House announced Wednesday that Adams would meet with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , the highest level of contact accorded to Adams in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;12	Major 's spokesman , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Britain had not changed its mind about excluding Sinn Fein from an investment conference in Belfast , despite pressure from American politicians to the contrary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;13	On Wednesday , Adams and John Hume , Northern Ireland 's most respected politician , issued a statement pressing Britain to begin talking with Sinn Fein .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;14	`` There should be no more stalling , '' they said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;15	A series of meetings and joint statements last year by Adams and Hume , leader of the Catholic-based Social Democratic and Labor Party , helped pave the way for the IRA 's open-ended truce .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;16	Britain has refused to invite Sinn Fein officials to the foreign investment forum in Belfast on Dec. 13-14 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;17	President Clinton plans to send Commerce Secretary Ron Brown at the head of a U.S. delegation , but a congressmen visiting Ireland says Clinton should rethink that if Britain keeps shunning Sinn Fein .
APW_ENG_19941201.0192;18	`` Everyone seems to be acting in good faith except the British , '' U.S. Rep. Peter King -LRB- R-N.Y. -RRB- , said Wednesday in Dublin , the Irish capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;0	Former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield , who hopes to fight again despite being on the medical suspension list because of a heart problem , has fired his manager .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;1	Shelly Finkel , who has been in Holyfield 's camp since 1984 and at the forefront since Holyfield fired business manager Ken Sanders in 1991 , received a termination letter Monday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;2	Finkel , who still manages a handful of fighters , most notably Pernell Whitaker , said Wednesday he was neither surprised nor bitter about the split , although he said the manner in which the firing was handled was unusual .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;3	`` The letter basically said , ` I wo n't be using your services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;4	You 've been a great manager and a real good friend , ' and had all these compliments , '' Finkel said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;5	`` There 's no hard feelings on my part .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;6	I 've seen it coming .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;7	It was n't appropriate -LRB- to continue -RRB- because I 've been against him fighting again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;8	I 'm sure it caused a gulf between us . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;9	Holyfield could not be reached for comment Wednesday and his spokesman , Ron Bell , declined to comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0194;10	Holyfield hopes to be removed from boxing 's medical suspension list and licensed by the Nevada State Athletic Commission after recently passing heart tests at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn.
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;0	Russian prisons are inhuman and torturous , with underfed inmates crammed into stinking , standing-room-only cells , a U.N. report said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;1	It said conditions in pre-trial remand centers -- where first time offenders accused of petty crimes may wait for five years for a court appearance -- were even worse than labor camps for hardened convicts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;2	`` The oppressive heat , lack of oxygen , and the odors of sweat , excrement and disease created by gross overcrowding are overpowering , '' said Nigel Rodley , the author of the report and the U.N. 's special investigator on torture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;3	At the invitation of the Russian government , Rodley spent two weeks in the Moscow and St. Petersburg area in summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;4	He visited four remand centers , two police headquarters , one labor camp , one juvenile center and one hospital for seriously ill prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;5	The Russian government estimates there are 500,000 prisoners in about 528 prisons and penal colonies throughout the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;6	Russia has the highest rate of detentions in the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;7	Rodley , a British human rights expert , said the rocketing crime rate following the end of Communist control had worsened acute overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;8	He criticized Russian authorities for trying to respond to public concern about crime by throwing petty offenders into jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;9	He recommended that President Boris Yeltsin should issue a presidential decree to release 71,000 non-violent , first-time offenders to try to ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;10	`` It 's a radical proposal because it 's a radical problem which needs to be addressed urgently , '' Rodley told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;11	He said beatings and maltreatment were widespread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;12	Rodley said even reading accounts of atrocious conditions did not prepare him for the appalling reality .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;13	`` The conditions are cruel , inhuman and degrading ; they are torturous , '' he wrote about cells in Moscow 's notorious Butryskaya prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;14	`` There is virtually no daylight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;15	There is insufficient room for everyone to lie down , sit down or even stand up at the same time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;16	Butryrskaya prison was constructed in 1771 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;17	There has been very little refurbishment since then .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;18	Built for 3,500 prisoners , it now holds 6,300 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;19	`` The food , not always available because of the indebtedness of the institutions -- is primitive , of a fat-saturated soupy nature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0195;20	It is consumed in the cell and is excreted in the cell , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;0	The number of Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in two months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;1	The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 317,000 in the week ended Nov. 26 , the smallest number since Sept. 24 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;2	Initial claims dropped 12,000 from 329,000 in the previous week , the biggest decrease since July 30 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;3	That figure was revised upward from the 326,000 initially reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;4	The same report showed the four-week moving average of jobless claims declining for the first time in eight weeks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;5	The average was 326,250 , down 1,250 from the previous week 's revised 327,500 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;6	The initial report , released last week , put the figure at 326,750 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;7	The four-week average had not declined since Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;8	Many analysts consider the four-week average a better indicator of hiring trends than the weekly number because it smooths out weekly fluctuations and is less volatile .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;9	The most reliable indicator , the monthly employment report showing hiring levels for November , is scheduled for release Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;10	Last month , unemployment dipped to a four-year low and hourly wages rose at the fastest pace in 11 years , among the factors that prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for a sixth time this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;11	The October jobless rate was 5.8 percent , down from 5.9 percent a month earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;12	Most economists expect the same number for November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;13	An increase in the number of initial claims was reported in 48 states and territories in the week ended Nov. 19 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;14	Four reported decreases , while the number was unchanged in one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0196;15	State figures are reported a week behind the national ones .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;0	Russian prisons are inhuman and torturous , with underfed inmates crammed into stinking , standing-room-only cells , a U.N. report said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;1	It said conditions in pre-trial remand centers -- where first time offenders accused of petty crimes may wait for five years for a court appearance -- were even worse than labor camps for hardened convicts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;2	`` The oppressive heat , lack of oxygen , and the odors of sweat , excrement and disease created by gross overcrowding are overpowering , '' said Nigel Rodley , the author of the report and the U.N. 's special investigator on torture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;3	At the invitation of the Russian government , Rodley spent two weeks in the Moscow and St. Petersburg area in summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;4	He visited four remand centers , two police headquarters , one labor camp , one juvenile center and one hospital for seriously ill prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;5	The Russian government estimates there are 500,000 prisoners in about 528 prisons and penal colonies throughout the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;6	Russia has the highest rate of detentions in the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;7	Rodley , a British human rights expert , said the rocketing crime rate following the end of Communist control had worsened acute overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;8	He criticized Russian authorities for trying to respond to public concern about crime by throwing petty offenders into jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;9	He recommended that President Boris Yeltsin should issue a presidential decree to release 71,000 non-violent , first-time offenders to try to ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;10	`` It 's a radical proposal because it 's a radical problem which needs to be addressed urgently , '' Rodley told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;11	He said beatings and maltreatment were widespread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;12	Rodley said even reading accounts of atrocious conditions did not prepare him for the appalling reality .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;13	`` The conditions are cruel , inhuman and degrading ; they are torturous , '' he wrote about cells in Moscow 's notorious Butryskaya prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;14	`` There is virtually no daylight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;15	There is insufficient room for everyone to lie down , sit down or even stand up at the same time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;16	Butryrskaya prison was constructed in 1771 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;17	There has been very little refurbishment since then .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;18	Built for 3,500 prisoners , it now holds 6,300 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;19	`` The food , not always available because of the indebtedness of the institutions -- is primitive , of a fat-saturated soupy nature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0197;20	It is consumed in the cell and is excreted in the cell , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;0	The government has protested to the producers of a U.S. television comedy over what it called racist and sexist remarks about Filipino women .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;1	The Department of Foreign Affairs said Thursday it objected to a line in the show `` Frasier '' where a co-star says his wife is getting a face lift for dlrs 25,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;2	The co-star 's father replies : `` For an extra five grand -LRB- dlrs 5,000 -RRB- you can get a whole new wife from the Philippines . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;3	`` Our people are not chattel , '' the department quoted Raul Rabe , the Philippines ' ambassador in Washington , as saying in a letter to David Angel , Peter Casey , David Lee and Cris Floyd , the Los Angeles-based executive producers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;4	He urged them to `` exert all effort to ensure that this particular feature is not inflicted upon your viewers . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;5	Portions of the show featuring the controversial line had been shown in promotional previews , the department said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;6	It aired in the United States on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;7	Rabe said the reference to Filipino women `` is not only unfair to a people who have done so much for the United States as its oldest ally in Asia , it diminishes the significant contributions that the large economically upscale Filipino-American community has made to the very fabric of this -LRB- American -RRB- nation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;8	In a separate protest letter to KNBC-Channel 4 in Los Angeles , the Philippine Consulate there said a Philippine law passed in 1991 bans the mail-order bride business and other similar practices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;9	It said the episode shows the `` insensitivity and ignorance '' of the writers and `` perpetuates the kind of blindly negative stereotyping of other peoples and cultures reminiscent of a less enlightened period in American television and media . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0198;10	A dispatcher at KNBC before business hours Thursday said no one was available for comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved an American proposal to draw up a blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;1	The ministers endorsed a 12-month study to consider how to expand the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Central and East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;2	Issues will include financing , integrating the newcomers ' armies and nuclear issues , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;3	Anxious to ease Russian fears about the expansion , the foreign ministers emphasized the alliance was not trying to create a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;4	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a draft of their final communique .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;5	The plan to open up to the East was planned as the centerpiece of the two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;6	But the unprecedented strains between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia overshadowed the talks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;7	In an effort to heal the divisions , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;8	That marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;9	Seeking to mend fences , Christopher told the allies :
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;10	`` Let me stress one important fact : The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;11	It does not diminish NATO 's enduring importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;12	The deep splits within the alliance were highlighted by a letter from Germany 's ambassador to NATO that accused the United States of sowing mistrust among the allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;13	The letter from Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen accused the United States of acting behind the backs of its allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;14	`` The alliance is divided and in crisis , '' concluded Richthofen 's cable to his Foreign Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;15	The letter was leaked to a leading German newspaper , the Suddeutsche Zeitung , which published extracts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;16	Opening the meeting , Willy Claes , the new NATO secretary-general , appealed for unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;17	`` We are now being put to -LRB- the -RRB- test , and I have every confidence that our solidarity will see us through . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;18	The foreign ministers are anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;19	They ordered a study that would set out the terms for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;20	It should be ready when the ministers meet in Brussels a year from now .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;21	The United States had initially proposed a six-month study of enlargement , but the Europeans , mindful of Russia 's fears of isolation , extended it to 12 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;22	`` We should avoid premature enlargement that gives the impression that we seek a redivision of the European continent , '' said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , according to a spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;23	The study will not name candidates for membership -- although Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners -- nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;24	`` It is premature to discuss the timeframe for enlargement or which particular countries would be invited to join the alliance , '' the draft communique said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;25	Instead , the study will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;26	To counter Russian worries about NATO 's eastward expansion , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Moscow and agree to hold regular talks on security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;27	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis was taking a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;28	On Friday , Christopher will meet here with his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;29	British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;30	Officials said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe may join him for talks with the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;31	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that may allow Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;32	That plan requires them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;33	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;34	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0199;35	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;0	The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has decided to accept Vietnam as its seventh member , officials at the organization 's Secretariat said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;1	The Secretariat 's foreign office in Jakarta , Indonesia , confirmed the decision after the Vietnamese government said it expected to enter ASEAN next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;2	Vietnam has long sought membership in anticipation of trade and investment benefits from closer ties to the more developed ASEAN economies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;3	Earlier Thursday , a Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ngo Van Hoa , told a news conference that ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh announced the decision in a recent interview with a Malaysian newspaper , the Star .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;4	Asked if Vietnam had received any direct notification of the decision from ASEAN , Hoa only smiled and said , `` I am asking you to read between the lines . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;5	But he indicated that Vietnam regards the decision as official and final .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;6	Again quoting the Star , he said ASEAN officials made the decision at a meeting in Brunei Nov. 3-5 , with the actual admission to take place next July when ASEAN foreign ministers hold their regular meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;7	Vietnam hopes for economic benefits from membership , but its admission also would dramatize the extent to which former Cold War divisions have melted away in the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;8	ASEAN was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War as a buffer against the spread of communism in Asia , represented by Vietnam and China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;9	It has become influential and active only in recent years since shifting its focus more heavily to economic cooperation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0200;10	The current members are Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore and Thailand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;0	Americans ' income surged 1.4 percent in October , the ninth straight increase and the biggest jump in eight months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;1	The Commerce Department also reported Thursay that spending rose 0.7 percent in October , the strongest showing since it advanced 0.9 percent in August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;2	Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also climbed 1.4 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;3	The overall income gain was the largest since it rose 1.7 percent in February .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;4	Income last fell in January , when it slipped 0.6 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;5	The increases reported Thursday for both income and spending were higher than many analysts predicted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;6	In September , personal income increased 0.6 percent and spending rose just 0.2 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;7	Consumer spending , which accounts for two-thirds of the nation 's gross domestic product , was up for the sixth straight month and eight of the last nine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;8	The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans ' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- climbed to 4.7 percent in October , from 4.1 percent the previous month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0201;9	The savings rate was the highest since April 1993 when it was 5 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;0	Flashy dressing is all right in the Senate , but men must wear a jacket and definitely should n't wear women 's clothes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;1	That was the message delivered Thursday night to Sen. Jim McKiernan , who turned up for a legislative session wearing a woman 's jacket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;2	During one of many votes on a package of bills relating to the world trade organization , McKiernan , who is noted for his flashy sartorial sense and his colorful ties , entered the chamber without a jacket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;3	The move sparked a mild and friendly reprimand from the temporary chairman of committees , Sen. Grant Chapman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;4	McKiernan accepted the rebuke and was wearing a jacket when he returned for the next vote , but he appeared to have it wrong again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;5	`` While I appreciate Senator McKiernan 's efforts to find a jacket , I would appreciate if he could find a male jacket before the next division , '' Chapman said to cries of `` Hear , hear ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;6	McKiernan protested , and said there was nothing in the Senate rules related to the color or `` gender '' of the jacket a senator may wear .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;7	McKiernan said the first incident was an innocent mistake because the voting bells had caught him too far from his room , giving him little time to return and pick up his jacket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;8	On the second occassion , Sen. Sue West offered him her jacket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;9	McKiernan expressed regret about one point -- his dress sense was offended by the combination of the striped gray women 's jacket , red ribbon and his multi-coloured tie .
APW_ENG_19941201.0202;10	`` It clashed something dreadful with my tie , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;0	Fighting broke out again overnight around a U.N. `` safe area '' in northwest Bosnia , after it became clear that the peace mission by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;1	Unfazed by the prospect of a complete withdrawal of all peacekeepers , Bosnia 's rebel Serbs refused even to meet with the U.N. chief to discuss a nationwide cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;2	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire erupted late Wednesday around the town of Bihac , where the Muslim-led government is trying to hold off rebel Serb forces .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;3	Fighting continued early today , along with some shelling .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;4	The Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic , pledged that despite recent heavy losses , Bihac would not fall into Serb hands and the government army would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;5	His comments , published in a Sarajevo newspaper today , underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further to reach a cease-fire and a comprehensive peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;6	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher told NATO allies that the Clinton administration now agrees with its European allies that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;7	Christopher and Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;8	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;9	At a breakfast with Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission , the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;10	The threat reflects a growing frustration as the Serbs continue their assaults and the government refuses new concessions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;11	More than 350 peacekeepers are still being held hostage and the West is divided about how to respond .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;12	Boutros-Ghali said he will not recommend a pullout `` for the time being . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;13	But he said `` it will become impossible '' to sustain support for the peacekeepers in the Security Council unless the Serbs and the government agree to talk peace and cooperate with the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;14	In New York , French U.N. Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee said `` there is no question '' of a withdrawal now , `` but if the situation continues to deteriorate , it will be more difficult to keep the troops there . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;15	A withdrawal by peacekeepers would likely lead to more fighting and could be dangerous for the departing troops , as both Bosnian Serbs and government forces rush U.N. camps to seize equipment before it can be destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;16	It also would cause widespread hardship because the United Nations feeds an estimated 3 million people across the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;17	Most are in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;18	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the 2 -LCB- - year conflict launched by Serbs after Bosnia 's Muslim-Croat majority voted to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;19	Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their war-won land holdings to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;20	Boutros-Ghali 's visit followed admissions from top U.S. and NATO officials that they ca n't force a solution to the conflict without a huge ground force no one is willing to provide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;21	As insurance against further NATO bombings , Serbs have taken more than 400 U.N. soldiers hostage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;22	Forty-five Britons were released Wednesday , but some Canadian , French , Russian and Ukrainian peacekeepers have been held now for a week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0203;23	More than 100 Dutch troops have been held hostage since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;0	Lowry Nelson Jr. , a former professor of comparative literature at Yale University , died following surgery in Tallinn , where he was doing research .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;1	Nelson , who lived in Bethany , Conn. , died Nov. 12 , the New Haven -LRB- Conn. -RRB- Register reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;2	The cause was thromboembolism , according to The New York Times .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;3	Nelson was instrumental in forming the Comparative Literature Department at Yale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;4	Before retiring in June after 31 years at Yale , he published and edited several books on poetry and literary theory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;5	He received his doctorate from Yale in 1961 , and taught at Harvard and the University of California at Los Angeles before returning to Yale in 1963 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;6	Nelson was born in Provo , Utah , on May 21 , 1926 , and received a bachelor 's degree from Harvard in 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;7	He is survived by two sisters , Ann Nelson of Charlotte , N.C. , and Janet Nelson Friedell of Lexington , Ky.
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;8	Services were held in Kentucky and a memorial service is planned at Yale in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;9	The Times said Nelson was in Estonia doing research on the Russian Symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0204;10	He specialized in literature from the 13th to the early 20th centuries .

APW_ENG_19941201.0206;0	Jeffrey Dahmer died within minutes of receiving two major blows to the head , a coroner said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;1	Dahmer probably was hit a total of four or five times in the head , Columbia County Coroner C. Keith Epps said Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;2	The blows that did the most damage were to the right side in the front of the head and to the left side in the back , Epps said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;3	Another inmate who was attacked with Dahmer Monday as they cleaned prison bathrooms , Jesse Anderson , died Wednesday after being taken off life support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;4	He suffered injuries similar to Dahmer 's , Epps said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;5	Dahmer , 34 , had confessed to killing 17 young men and boys , mutilating and sometimes cannibalizing or eating his victims .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;6	He had been behind bars since July 1991 , when a handcuffed man escaped from him and led Milwaukee police to an apartment full of body parts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;7	Anderson , 37 , was sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife , Barbara .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;8	She was stabbed 21 times in August 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;9	`` What -LRB- we -RRB- said when Barbara died is as true today as it was then , '' her brother , Kevin Lynch , read in a brief statement from the family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;10	`` No one should have to die such a brutal death . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;11	Officials at the Columbia Correctional Institution said Christopher Scarver was the sole suspect in the slayings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;12	The 25-year-old man is serving a life term for an execution-style murder during a robbery .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;13	Columbia County Sheriff James D. Smith , however , said he had n't yet narrowed the list of suspects .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;14	He said eight people were in the prison 's recreation area during the 45 minutes around the attacks , including two guards , a recreation director and other inmates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;15	`` I got two victims and I got three inmates and that 's where I 'm going to leave it , '' Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;16	Dahmer was found in a pool of blood in a staff bathroom ; Anderson in a locker room adjoining a basketball court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;17	A bloody broom handle was found near Dahmer , but investigators have said his head might have been beaten against a wall or the floor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0206;18	He was n't pronounced dead until he was taken to a hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;0	Yasser Arafat 's government on Thursday took charge of tax collection in the West Bank in another step toward expanding Palestinian autonomy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;1	The transfer of the tax authority , and the handover of the health system set for later Thursday , complete the `` early empowerment '' enabling Palestinians to control most aspects of their lives despite continued Israeli occupation in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;2	The PLO , which runs the six-month-old autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho , has in recent months also taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;3	`` What we have completed gives the Palestinians a first entrance to the West Bank , '' said West Bank military governor Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar , signing over the tax department to Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;4	The move came days before Israel and the PLO were to begin difficult negotiations on stage two of autonomy -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;5	Israel is concerned the safety of the 120,000 Jewish settlers could not be guaranteed once the army pulled out of Palestinian towns as stipulated in the Israel-PLO accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;6	There are calls to renegotiate the agreement , including a proposal Wednesday by Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin to skip the interim phase altogether and begin talks now on the final status of the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;7	This coincides with a growing desire among Israelis for greater separation from the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;8	Police Minister Moshe Shahal on Thursday called for a complete closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip once troops redeploy in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;9	He spoke a day after a West Bank Palestinian axed a 19-year-old woman soldier to death in northern Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;10	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;11	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;12	A closure would prevent 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza , including tens of thousands of day workers , from entering Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;13	The Yedioth Ahronoth daily said in an editorial Thursday that Israel 's leaders had no clear idea how to stop the attacks and what to do with the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;14	Palestinian tax officials said Thursday their goal was to make their impoverished autonomy administration self-sufficient .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;15	`` We can not depend for the rest of our lives on the donor countries and the foreign investors in building our Palestinian state , '' said Deputy Finance Minister Atef Alawneh .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;16	In Brussels , foreign donors this week released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier , mostly to help the Palestinians meet running costs for a few months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;17	Alawneh said he eventually hoped to raise dlrs 300-400 million annually in taxes , much more than raised by Israel , but the current system needed improvement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;18	`` We are not satisfied with the way taxes are paid in Gaza and Jericho .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;19	We were not ready .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;20	and we did not use the proper ways of convincing '' residents to pay , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;21	During the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation , many Palestinians refused to pay taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;22	Israel retaliated by denying tax evaders documents such as drivers ' licenses and travel papers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;23	Soldiers accompanied tax collectors in night raids to confiscate goods from Palestinian homes in lieu of payment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;24	The West Bank town of Beit Zahour staged a collective tax revolt , becoming the target of many such raids .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;25	George Rishmawi , a Beit Zahour textile factory owner , said he hoped the Palestinians would adopt a different policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;26	`` We hope the whole system will be changed and we will start a new era , '' said Rishmawi , who was jailed for three months for not paying taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;27	`` We have paid the Israelis enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;28	They ripped us off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;29	They were thieves with licenses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0207;30	Alawneh said tax debts going back to the Israeli era would not be forgiven , and only fines and interest would be canceled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;0	Bosnian Serbs detained more peacekeepers , denied resupply convoys and fired missiles at Sarajevo on Thursday in a further challenge to the United Nations ' crumbling bid to keep control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;1	A day after U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali 's failed peace mission , defenders and attacking Serbs also traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;2	U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia , that Bosnian Serb units had made an incursion across the border into Croatia and kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;3	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;4	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has not been able to make contact with its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;5	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;6	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs failed to react to 21 requests for convoy passage through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;7	He said food and fuel supplies for the United Nations were running increasingly short in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;8	Humanitarian convoys were also blocked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;9	In downtown Sarajevo , two buildings of the Interior Ministry were hit by one and three anti-tank missiles respectively , and four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;10	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed because Serbs denied flight clearance , ruling out any relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;11	Intransigence by both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;12	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;13	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;14	Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;15	Comments by the Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;16	He said Bihac would not fall , and that the Bosnian army eventually would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;17	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;18	Their leader , Radovan Karadzic , refused to come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali rejected entering Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;19	But the U.N. chief executive will be in Geneva Friday through Sunday to `` continue his intensive diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution , especially for a cease-fire '' in Bosnia , his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;20	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;21	Ivanko said later that Bosnian Serb forces kept the heat on the government 's hard-pressed 5th Corps , with significant fighting reported to the southwest and south of the Bihac pocket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;22	But there was no immediate information on any changes in the frontlines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;23	Serbs are holding 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;24	One civilian was killed near the Bihac stadium by small-arms fire , while a number of shells exploded near the Bihac hospital , badly injuring one person , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;25	NATO ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday were to hear a proposal from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for a new international conference on former Yugoslavia at which the Serbs could make demands for new peace proposals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;26	Already , senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they long have desired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;27	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;28	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0208;29	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;0	Positive drug tests for 11 Chinese athletes were not evidence of regular drug use in Chinese sports , an official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;1	`` This is an act by individuals , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian said at a weekly briefing , adding that Chinese sports authorities practice `` strict prohibition , strict testing and strict punishment '' of drug use .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;2	Chen reiterated China 's position that recent stunning performances by its athletes were the result of hard , scientific training .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;3	`` Their performance can not be denied , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;4	The 11 , including seven swimmers , tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the Asian Games in October in Hiroshima , Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;5	On Wednesday , in its first official comment on the affair , the Chinese national Olympic committee said it was `` shocked and upset '' by the test results .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;6	They followed allegations by coaches and athletes from other countries that the stunning successes of China 's athletes may be due in part to the use of performance-enhancing drugs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;7	Allegations of drug use among Chinese women swimmers escalated at the World Championships in Rome in September when they won 12 of 16 gold medals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;8	The Chinese women won all 15 of their races at the Asian Games , raising further suspicion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;9	On Thursday , the Yomiuri Shimbun , Japan 's largest-circulation daily , identified the 11 accused of illegal doping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;10	They include Yang Aihua , who won the women 's 400-meter freestyle at the World Championships , and Lu Bin , who won four gold medals at the Asian Games and set a world record in the women 's 200-meter individual medley .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;11	Yang already has been banned from competition for two years for a positive test in Hiroshima just before the games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;12	The Yomiuri said the other swimmers include women 's 400-meter freestyle champion Zhou Guanbin ; male teammate Xiong Guoming , who also won four golds ; 50-meter freestyle titlist Hu Bin ; 200-meter butterfly gold medalist Xue Wei ; and Fu Yong , a bronze medalist .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;13	Also accused , it said , were women 's 400-meter hurdles champion Han Qing ; men 's canoeing double gold medalist Zhang Lei ; canoeing silver medalist Qiu Suoren ; and women 's cycling sprint champion Wang Yan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;14	Germany 's swimming federation responded by announcing plans to boycott the World Cup in Beijing and other events in China to protest the country 's doping record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;15	But Chinese sports officials said Thursday there are no plans for a World Cup swimming competition in Beijing next month ,
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;16	The World Swimming Federation had assigned the dates Jan. 7-8 to Beijing for one stage of the World Cup competitions , held in several different cities each year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;17	But the Chinese Swimming Association said it has been unable to raise funds for the event .
APW_ENG_19941201.0209;18	`` We never even sent out any invitations , '' said an official who answered the phone at the association 's offices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;0	An explosive thrown in a clash between political rivals killed one person Thursday during a state election considered to be an important test for Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;1	Police said they also killed three militants of the Peoples War Group , an anarchist organization that carried out a series of sabotage incidents in the final weeks of the campaign to disrupt the voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;2	At least 29 people were killed in land mine explosions blamed on the group .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;3	Aruna Bahugana , a senior police officer , reported that an election official was dragged out of his polling booth and stabbed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;4	He was injured but it was not known how seriously .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;5	Cases also were reported of looting ballot boxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;6	The violence came during elections to the state assembly of Andhra Pradesh , Rao 's home state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;7	There were no reports of election trouble in the neighboring state of Karnataka .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;8	Voting for state legislatures in the two south Indian states was seen as an important bellwether for Rao 's Congress Party , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;9	A loss in Rao 's own state of Andhra Pradesh could unleash rivalries in the governing party that he suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;10	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for elections in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;11	The voting is staggered to allow police forces to move from one to another to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;12	The Congress campaign in Andhra Pradesh was thrown into disarray by the promise of an aging film star-turned-politician , N.T. Rama Rao , to sell rice to the poor at two rupees per kilogram -LRB- three cents per pound -RRB- -- six times less than the market rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;13	Pursuing free market reforms , Rao could offer no subsidies to match his opponent 's challenge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;14	Rama Rao , 72 , who built a popular image by playing Hindu deities in classic films , campaigned with the help of his young crowd-pulling wife , whom he married last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0210;15	The prime minister put his own prestige at stake by campaigning hard in his state , but his party 's prospects were hurt by infighting among local politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;0	Russia 's foreign minister said Thursday that withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia was not inevitable and that diplomatic alternatives remained to be explored .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;1	Andrei Kozyrev also called for intensified efforts to implement a ceasefire throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;2	`` We see some elements which could be promoted , tendencies which are encouraging , '' Kozyrev told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;3	He said the `` contact group '' of five nations that drafted a peace plan in July should `` capitalize on positive elements '' to resolve the crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;4	Ministers of the contact group , including Kozyrev , are to meet Friday in Brussels to try salvaging their diplomatic approach to ending the nearly three-year-old war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;5	Kozyrev refused to specify new initiatives the Russians were expected to propose in Brussels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;6	He spoke a day after U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali threatened to withdraw peacekeepers unless Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government cooperate with the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;7	Serb advances on the Bihac pocket , a U.N.-declared `` safe zone , '' have made a mockery of the peacekeepers , ill-equipped to defend themselves or fulfill their mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;8	`` We are in the process of discussing the security of the peacekeepers with the secretary general , and daily , if not hourly , considering withdrawing because we do n't want them to become easy targets or hostages , '' Kozyrev said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;9	However , he insisted the peacekeepers ' situation was not hopeless .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;10	Kozyrev suggested that sanctions against Belgrade be lifted as a reward for its decision to close Serbian borders to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;11	He called the sanctions `` ridiculous '' because they were leveled when Serbia rejected the earlier Vance-Owen peace plan , which is now defunct .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;12	Serbia accepts the current peace plan , he noted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;13	`` We have to further recognize Belgrade 's positive input , '' Kozyrev said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;14	Kozyrev spoke on the final day of a five-day meeting of the Western European Union -- 10 nations that hope to become the defense arm of a new , expanded Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;15	In an address to the closing session , Kozyrev said the Russian and WEU approaches to the Bosnian crisis were `` very close . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;16	Russia , like France and Britain , would withdraw its peacekeepers if the arms embargo on Bosnia were lifted , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;17	The United States has pushed to lift the embargo so underequipped Bosnian Muslims could better defend themselves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;18	Referring to conflicts in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union , Kozyrev appealed for outside assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;19	`` Unfortunately , no international organization has yet been able to provide us assistance that could be at least comparable to our own efforts , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0211;20	Russia has 15,000 soldiers in the farflung areas , he said , while international contributions `` do not go beyond sending a handful of observers . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;0	A moderate quake struck the Ionian Sea island of Levkas Thursday , causing minor damage but no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;1	The Salonica University Seismological Institute said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter with its epicenter on the seabed near Levkas , 300 kilometers -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- southwest of this northern city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;2	It occurred at 9:17 a.m. -LRB- 0717 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;3	It was followed a few minutes later by a quake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;4	Authorities said some buildings were slightly damaged by the initial tremor , but there were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;5	It was the second quake to hit the Levkas region in two days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;6	A quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 hit the area on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;7	Officials at the Athens Seismological Institute said they thought the tremors following Tuesday 's quake were aftershocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;8	A quake with a magnitude of 2.5 to 3 is the smallest felt by people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0212;9	A magnitude 5 can cause moderate damage while a 6 can cause severe damage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;0	When Joan Boltman first heard her son was aboard a sinking luxury liner for a second time , she feared his luck had run out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;1	`` There 's always the thought that he could n't survive this type of thing twice , '' she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday , a day after hearing her son , Robin , had been rescued from the burning Achille Lauro cruise ship off the coast of Somalia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;2	More than 250 South Africans were aboard the Achille Lauro , and anxious friends and relatives spent hours Wednesday trying to learn their fate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;3	A South African resident , Arthur Morris , was one of two reported deaths , but the rest of the almost 1,000 passengers and crew members were rescued , though some suffered broken bones and other injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;4	Morris ' daughter , Carina Rogers , told The Star newspaper in Johannesburg her father died after a piece of ship 's equipment fell on him in the lifeboat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;5	She failed to return phone calls Thursday from the AP .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;6	Robin Boltman was working as a magician on the Achille Lauro as it cruised from Genoa , Italy , to Durban , South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;7	It was the same job he held on the Oceanos , a Greek-owned ship that sank off the southeast coast of Africa in August 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;8	The first time , Boltman was considered a hero for helping restore order on the sinking ship after some crew members fled in a life boat after an explosion ripped open the hull .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;9	All of the more than 500 people on board were rescued safely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;10	So far , few details of what happened aboard the Achille Lauro have emerged .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;11	`` I was shocked to hear that this had happened twice to Robin , '' his mother said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;12	`` I guess this is a natural course of events for the mother of a magician . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;13	Robin volunteered for the Achille Lauro just three weeks after the Oceanos sinking , his mother said , despite the ship 's history of trouble -- an explosion in 1965 , a deadly fire in 1981 and a hijacking by Palestinians in 1985 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;14	`` He 's an entertainer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;15	That is his life and I 'm sure that he would n't have gone if he thought there would be a problem , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;16	Kevin Grinaker of Durban said his 72-year-old mother previously had traveled three times on the Achille Lauro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;17	`` She 's super-superstititous , '' Grinaker told Associated Press Television .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;18	`` She has this traveling bag that 's her lucky charm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0213;19	I do n't think that she will ever travel again if that bag is n't recovered on this trip . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;0	Russian prisons are inhuman and torturous , with underfed inmates crammed into stinking , standing-room-only cells , a U.N. report said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;1	It said conditions in pre-trial remand centers -- where first time offenders accused of petty crimes may wait for five years for a court appearance -- were even worse than labor camps for hardened convicts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;2	`` The oppressive heat , lack of oxygen , and the odors of sweat , excrement and disease created by gross overcrowding are overpowering , '' said Nigel Rodley , the author of the report and the U.N. 's special investigator on torture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;3	At the invitation of the Russian government , Rodley spent two weeks in the Moscow and St. Petersburg area in summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;4	He visited four remand centers , two police headquarters , one labor camp , one juvenile center and one hospital for seriously ill prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;5	The Russian government estimates there are 500,000 prisoners in about 528 prisons and penal colonies throughout the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;6	Russia has the highest rate of detentions in the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;7	Rodley , a British human rights expert , said the rocketing crime rate following the end of Communist control had worsened acute overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;8	He criticized Russian authorities for trying to respond to public concern about crime by throwing petty offenders into jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;9	He recommended that President Boris Yeltsin should issue a presidential decree to release 71,000 non-violent , first-time offenders to try to ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;10	`` It 's a radical proposal because it 's a radical problem which needs to be addressed urgently , '' Rodley told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;11	He said beatings and maltreatment were widespread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;12	Rodley said even reading accounts of atrocious conditions did not prepare him for the appalling reality .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;13	`` The conditions are cruel , inhuman and degrading ; they are torturous , '' he wrote about cells in Moscow 's notorious Butryskaya prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;14	`` There is virtually no daylight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;15	There is insufficient room for everyone to lie down , sit down or even stand up at the same time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;16	Butryrskaya prison was constructed in 1771 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;17	There has been very little refurbishment since then .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;18	Built for 3,500 prisoners , it now holds 6,300 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;19	`` The food , not always available because of the indebtedness of the institutions -- is primitive , of a fat-saturated soupy nature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0214;20	It is consumed in the cell and is excreted in the cell , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;0	ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- AP -RRB- - The main opposition party on Thursday accused Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 's government of paying millions of rupees -LRB- dollars -RRB- in bribes to win the support of key politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;1	The opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , and Ms. Bhutto have been making charges and counter-charges of corruption for months , and the attacks have become increasingly personal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;2	Both have denied allegations of wrongdoing and none of the charges has been proven in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;3	Sharif told a news conference that Ms. Bhutto , her husband Asif Zardari , and President Farooq Leghari all took part in a scheme that set aside 260 million rupees -LRB- dlrs 8.5 million -RRB- of government money for personal use and for paying bribes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;4	`` The trail of corruption leads to the very top , including Farooq Leghari , Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari , '' Sharif said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;5	Sharif claimed a large chunk of the money was used to buy the support of independent legislators in the Northwest Frontier Provincial Assembly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;6	Sharif 's conservative Pakistan Muslim League headed a coalition that controlled the province until a number of independents defected earlier this year to support Ms. Bhutto 's liberal Pakistan People 's Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;7	Ms. Bhutto 's coalition now controls the province , and Sharif said her party paid bribes to get the independents to switch sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;8	Ms. Bhutto is on a trip to London and was not immediately available for comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;9	She has said repeatedly that her party is not guilty of corruption and has put a stop to abuses initiated by Sharif when he was prime minister from 1990-93 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;10	Even Pakistani politicians acknowledge that the country 's political system is riddled with graft , though they inevitably accuse their opponents of the worst offenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;11	Ms. Bhutto 's government arrested Sharif 's father , Mohammed Sharif , last month on charges of fraud and tax evasion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;12	Ms. Bhutto also said that the Sharif business empire , one of the largest in Pakistan , was built through extensive fraud .
APW_ENG_19941201.0215;13	Sharif 's accusations Thursday were seen largely as a response to Ms. Bhutto 's charges against him and his family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher is telling the NATO allies the Clinton administration has swung to their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;1	It is the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans led by France prevailed over the United States in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;2	It is a difficult assignment for Christopher , putting him in the awkward position of shifting gears even while denying U.S. policy on the war has changed or that there is a trans-Atlantic rift .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;3	Trying to patch over the embarrassing dispute , Christopher pronounced the alliance strong and he charted a plan for growth through absorption of East European countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;4	A ceremony was scheduled to establish links to Russia , for decades the direct target of NATO 's massive military preparedness program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;5	The plan was adopted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;6	Over the next 12 months , bureaucrats will study the financial , structural and nuclear implications of taking in Eastern and Central European countries -- despite Russia 's reservations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;7	Christopher told the allies in a speech that `` the tragedy of the war and bloodshed in Bosnia does not diminish our responsibility to build a comprehensive European security architecture . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;8	`` America 's interests in Europe have not changed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;9	`` Neither have the basic principles guiding our engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;10	And at the top of the list , Christopher said today , was that `` the United States has enduring political , military , economic and cultural links to Europe that must and will be preserved . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;11	Earlier , at breakfast with Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;12	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;13	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;14	However , his aides spread the word a trip by Christopher to Belgrade was unlikely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;15	Asked if the troops would be withdrawn , Hurd replied grimly : `` We certainly hope not . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;16	By chance , it was the Unites States ' turn to preside over a meeting today of the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's policy-making arm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;17	This puts Christopher under an even brighter spotlight , and he was responding both with a brief speech opening the session and a detailed one outlining U.S. plans for NATO 's expansion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;18	On Friday , Christopher intends to lay out the U.S. approach to the Bosnian war in a meeting with Hurd and Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe of France , Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and Klaus Kinkel of Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;19	It is centered on a call for an international peace conference that would give the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity to demand changes in the peace plan they have rejected repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;20	They already have strong intimations of support from the Clinton administration in pressing for cross-border political ties to the Serb-dominated government in Belgrade -- a big step toward their goal of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;21	`` This alliance will continue to be the anchor of American engagement in Europe , the linchpin of trans-Atlantic security , '' Christopher said in a brief statement opening the North Atlantic Council session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;22	He also assured the 15 foreign ministers that the Clinton administration was committed to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe `` as part of our continuing engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;23	The European allies , particularly France and Britain , have managed to limit NATO air strikes despite U.N. assurances that Bihac , the mostly Muslim town on the verge of falling to the Serbs , was a `` safe area '' from which heavy weapons were to be excluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;24	They also hemmed in the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;25	Christopher , having threatened the Serbs in the past with NATO might , abandoned the threat when asked what `` sticks '' the United States was using to persuade the Serbs to relinquish their grip on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;26	If they kept fighting , Christopher said , they risked Serbia closing its border and a tightening of sanctions -- measures that are far less threatening than attacks by NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;27	Seeking to limit the damage to the alliance , which successfully stood up to the Soviet Union but has caved on Bosnia , Christopher said he wanted to stress that `` the crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia ; it 's not about NATO and its future . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;28	The other foreign ministers eagerly joined in his campaign to smooth over the disagreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;29	`` We had a lot of tension in the past few days , '' Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;30	`` Fortunately , this has passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;31	We all agree the only way to end this conflict is in a negotiated way . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;32	Kinkel , the German foreign minister , acknowledged U.S. policy on Bosnia had changed , and on dealing with the expansion of NATO as well .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;33	German Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen had filed a cable to his foreign ministry accusing the United States of sowing mistrust over Bosnia and the eastward expansion of the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;34	It is `` divided and in crisis , '' he concluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;35	But NATO 's impotence has raised questions about its future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;36	Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested after meeting in Brussels with alliance officials that the alliance may have become irrelevant and also that it may be time to withdraw U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0216;37	In Paris , Kozyrev told reporters before flying here that the peacekeepers should not be withdrawn and that there `` alternatives '' to dealing with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;0	Crippled by defense cuts and sharply declining demand , a major aircraft factory has put most of its workers on leave until January , the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;1	The Komsomolsk Aircraft Factory , the main producer of the Su-27 fighter plane , ceased all production of military equipment in late November , though it continues to produce consumer goods and civilian aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;2	Viktor Merkulov , general director of the factory , said that production of military equipment has dropped to 5.5 percent of 1991 levels , ITAR-Tass reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;3	The factory , near Russia 's Pacific Coast about 6,000 kilometers -LRB- 3,600 miles -RRB- east of Moscow , is the largest defense enterprise in the Far Eastern region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;4	But it is now the latest victim of post-Cold War defense cuts , which have shaken up the former Soviet military-industrial complex .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;5	A few factories have completed successful conversion projects or have sought new markets for military technology , but most have simply slashed production and personnel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;6	The Komsomolsk factory made a deal to sell a number of planes to China in 1992 , an agreement which provided the plant money to expand its production into other spheres .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;7	The factory has since tried to stay afloat by producing color televisions and food products , as well as the civilian aircraft S-80 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0217;8	Employees in the non-military sectors of the plant will remain employed , the news agency said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved an proposal to draw up a blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;1	The ministers endorsed a 12-month study to consider how to expand the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Central and East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;2	Issues will include financing , integrating the newcomers ' armies and nuclear issues , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;3	Anxious to ease Russian fears about the expansion , the foreign ministers emphasized the alliance was not trying to create a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;4	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a draft of their final communique .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;5	The plan to open up to the East , proposed by the United States , was to be the centerpiece of the two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;6	But the unprecedented strains between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia overshadowed the talks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;7	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis was taking a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;8	On Friday , Christopher will meet here with his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;9	British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;10	Officials said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe may join him for talks with the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;11	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that may allow Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;12	That plan requires them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;13	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;14	The NATO study would set out the terms for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;15	It should be ready when the ministers meet in Brussels a year from now .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;16	The study will not name candidates for membership -- although Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners -- nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;17	Instead , the study will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0219;18	To counter Russian worries about NATO 's eastward expansion , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Moscow and agree to hold regular talks on security .

APW_ENG_19941201.0223;0	A Bulgarian diplomat , a stockbroker and two rabbis were among 23 suspects accused of laundering more than dlrs 100 million in drug proceeds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;1	The defendants were part of a money laundering cell that enabled tens of millions of dollars to flow between major U.S. and European cities , said Carlo A. Boccia of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;2	During an investigation , authorities seized dlrs 5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;3	They arrested all but four of those named in a complaint that was sealed until Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;4	The organization operated in New York , Los Angeles , Houston , Chicago and Miami in the United States as well as in Germany , Switzerland , Italy , Puerto Rico and Colombia , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;5	According to court documents , the leaders of the organization in the United States were Richard Spence , a businessman who was formerly a New York City firefighter ; lawyer Harvey Weinig ; and Robert Hirsch , Weinig 's law partner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;6	Hirsch has pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges in a plea bargain with prosecutors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;7	Authorities allege that the three arranged for the pickup of narcotics proceeds from street corners and hotel rooms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;8	Among those allegedly sent as couriers were police Officer Michael T. Kalanz ; firefighter Charles Bruno ; hospital administrator Gary Salerno ; Los Angeles-based stockbroker Donald J. Hayden ; and rabbis Alexander Schwartz and Menashe Leifer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;9	Also arrested was Latchezar Christov , an honorary consul general for the Republic of Bulgaria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0223;10	Those arrested were charged with conspiracy and money laundering .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;0	Pope John Paul II repeated his desire to visit Israeli during a meeting Thursday with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , but he again declined to commit himself to a date , Vatican officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;1	The pope and Peres met for 30 minutes , with the Israeli renewing a long-standing invitation for a visit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;2	Speaking to Israel radio after the meeting , Peres said the pope would visit Israel '' before the end of the century . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;3	A Vatican statement said they discussed issues linked to the Middle East peace process , including relations with Palestinians , Lebanon and the '' future '' of Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;4	On Jerusalem , a city holy to Jews , Christians and Muslims , the Vatican has insisted that access to religious sites be assured through international guarantees .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;5	In a television interview broadcast by an Italian religious station earlier this week , Peres re-affirmed the Israeli position that Jerusalem will always be Israel 's capital and that politically the issue was closed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;6	But Peres said '' if we are talking about religious issues , we are ready to listen . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0224;7	Earlier , Peres presented his book '' The New Middle East , '' which has come out in Italian , to an audience of Italians and Israeli officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;0	NATO has asked Germany to contribute fighter planes to the U.N. mission in Bosnia , officials confirmed Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;1	The move would engage Germany 's military in its first hot war in 49 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;2	Chancellor Helmut Kohl was likely to intervene personally in any decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;3	The request is highly sensitive because of Germany 's postwar pacifist tradition , and the history of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans , a defense spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;4	By the same token , it would be difficult for Germany to turn down the request because of its repeated assertions that it wants to bear its share of international peacekeeping actions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;5	The fighter planes would be part of the force that has bombed Serb targets to stop attacks on U.N. protected zones or peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;6	The German planes would replace British fighters that apparently will be transferred elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;7	A July decision of the German supreme court enabled the military to engage in peacekeeping missions outside NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;8	Kohl has pushed for Germany to take on new responsibilities so it can gain more power in international affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0225;9	German forces were deployed as supply troops in Somalia last year , but the Bosnia action would be their first deployment in a combat situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;0	NATO has asked Germany to contribute fighter planes to the U.N. mission in Bosnia , officials confirmed Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;1	The move would engage Germany 's military in its first hot war in 49 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;2	Chancellor Helmut Kohl was likely to intervene personally in any decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;3	The request is highly sensitive because of Germany 's postwar pacifist tradition , and the history of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans , a defense spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;4	By the same token , it would be difficult for Germany to turn down the request because of its repeated assertions that it wants to bear its share of international peacekeeping actions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;5	The fighter planes would be part of the force that has bombed Serb targets to stop attacks on U.N. protected zones or peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;6	The German planes would replace British fighters that apparently will be transferred elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;7	A July decision of the German supreme court enabled the military to engage in peacekeeping missions outside NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;8	Kohl has pushed for Germany to take on new responsibilities so it can gain more power in international affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0226;9	German forces were deployed as supply troops in Somalia last year , but the Bosnia action would be their first deployment in a combat situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;0	A Jerusalem court on Thursday barred eight Jewish extremists from entering the Temple Mount after they illegally prayed at the holy site earlier this week and were kicked out by angry Muslim guards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;1	The eight may not visit the Temple Mount during Jewish holidays for the next six months , ruled Magistrate 's Court Judge Miriam Mizrahi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;2	The Temple Mount stands on the ground zero of the Arab-Israeli conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;3	The raised platform , once site of the Jewish Temple that was destroyed in 70 A.D. , today houses the Al Aqsa Mosque , the third holiest shrine of Islam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;4	Jewish extremists demand that Israel expel the Muslims from the Temple Mount and rebuild the Temple there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;5	Generally , Jews can visit the Temple Mount , but not pray there in groups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;6	Ultra-Orthodox Jews stay away from the area , saying no Jew should enter the Temple Mount until the coming of the Messiah .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;7	On Tuesday , Jewish extremists from the group `` Hai Vekayam '' -LRB- Alive and Well -RRB- held a Jewish prayer session on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;8	They were grabbed by Muslim guards and worshipers and kicked out amid curses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;9	The leader of the group , Yehuda Etzion , said Thursday that Jews must demonstrate their presence on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;10	`` The right of Jews to pray on the Temple Mount is interpreted by us as an obligation and not just a right , '' Etzion told Israel radio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;11	`` We will continue to realize this right and obligation in every way and on every occasion we can , '' Etzion said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;12	Etzion was a leader of an underground ring that waged a four-year campaign of terror against Palestinians in the 1980s , including car bombings that maimed two West Bank mayors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;13	He served four years in prison for conspiracy in an aborted plot to blow up the Dome of the Rock Mosque on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;14	Judge Mizrahi said Jews should be allowed to pray on the Temple Mount under the principle of freedom of worship , but that this right was less important than public safety , according to Israel radio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0227;15	She said Etzion 's group intended to incite riots , not to make use of the right to freedom of worship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;0	East Timor 's governor told two U.N. envoys Thursday that non-political fights touched off anti-Indonesian riots in the territory in mid-November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;1	Thousands of East Timorese rampaged through the streets of Dili on Nov. l3 , looting shops , burning cars and smashing windows in protests against Indonesia 's rule of the territory , a Portuguese colony before Indonesia annexed it in 1976 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;2	Attention was focused on the territory and Indonesia 's human rights record while Asian-Pacific leaders , including President Clinton , were holding an economic summit meeting in Indonesia in November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;3	`` They were purely criminal acts and non-political , fights between groups , which were later used by anti-government elements to create disorder on the island , '' Gov. Abilio Jose Osorio Soares told the envoys .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;4	He referred to fights between an East Timorese group and Indonesian traders from outside the island on the eve of the demonstration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;5	The rioting followed the third anniversary of the Nov. 12 , 1991 , massacre by Indonesian troops of unarmed civilians demonstrating for independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;6	U.N. envoys Frances Vendrell and Thamrat Samuel arrived in East Timor Thursday as part of preparations for forthcoming talks on the disputed territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;7	Foreign Ministers Ali Alatas of Indonesia and Jose Manuel Durao Barroso of Portugal are to meet Jan. 9 in Geneva to continue talks on East Timor under the auspices of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;8	The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the territory 's administering power .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;9	On Wednesday , the envoys met in Jakarta with imprisoned East Timor rebel leader Jose Alexandre Gusmao .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;10	Before his arrest in November l992 , Gusmao led a pro-independence struggle in East Timor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;11	He is serving a 20-year term .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;12	Meanwhile , two women , identified as Irene Flelak of the Netherlands , 42 , and Rosmary L. , 49 , of Australia , were detained Thursday on charges of conducting journalistic activities without the proper papers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;13	Police Chief Col. Sugianto said the two , who came to East Timor on Nov. 28 , would be sent home Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;14	Foreign journalists were allowed to visit East Timor during the Asic-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;15	After the Nov. 15 summit , they were told that once again they would need permits from the Department of Information to visit the territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;16	Meanwhile , a special envoy of Pope John Paul II arrived Thursday for a five-day visit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;17	The envoy , the Rev. Thomas Michel , met with Gov. Soares , who said they discussed religious life on the island .
APW_ENG_19941201.0228;18	East Timor is predominantly Roman Catholic , while the majority of Indonesians are Muslim .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;0	The Vietnamese government said Thursday it would not welcome a visit by William Colby , the former CIA chief who headed clandestine operations against pro-Communist guerrillas in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;1	Colby , now a Washington lawyer , had been planning to visit as a director of a U.S.-based investment fund called the Vietnam Frontier Fund .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;2	Asked if the government plans to issue him a visa , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ngo Van Hoa , said : `` At this time , it is not appropriate for a visit to Vietnam by Mr. William Colby . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;3	Colby was the CIA 's station chief in Saigon during the war , and was associated with the controversial Phoenix program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;4	The program sought to infiltrate the Communist guerrillas ' rural networks but led to sweeping arrests , torture and execution of suspects .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;5	Critics said most of those killed were innocent peasants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0229;6	Colby later headed the CIA under President Gerald Ford from 1973 to 1976 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;0	The Achille Lauro smoldered on a placid sea Thursday , a day after a raging fire forced the nearly 1,000 people aboard to take to lifeboats and abandon the cruise ship listing off Somalia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;1	Two passengers were reported dead from the Italian liner , which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;2	After a night aboard the oil tanker that picked them up , hundreds of passengers began transferring aboard an armada of commercial vessels and two U.S. Navy ships for passage to nearby ports , including Mombasa in Kenya , the Seychelles and Djibouti .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;3	`` The fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down toward the cabins , '' one survivor , Tony Webb , was quoted as telling the London Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;4	Webb , a 44-year-old Briton who now lives in Cape Town , South Africa , had taken his wife and 2-year-old son on the cruise after winning a contest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;5	He said he was still wearing his dinner jacket after a ship 's dance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;6	`` People were in their evening suits and dressing gowns , '' the paper quoted Webb as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;7	`` They had to ferry the children to the lifeboats first , '' Webb said , adding that the smoke grew thicker as the rest waited .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;8	As his son Michael clung to him , terrified , Webb recalled , '' flames were leaping up and there was smoke all around '' as passengers looked back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;9	Thursday 's transfer operation was '' very organized , '' said Cmdr. T McCreary , spokesman for the U.S. Navy 's Central Command , based in Bahrain . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;10	Folks down there have a pretty good handle on the situation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;11	At mid-morning on Thursday , the empty , scarred Achille Lauro was still afloat , listing badly to port .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;12	White steam and gray smoke poured from its port side and smaller streams came drifting out of the lower starboard deck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;13	Though her name was still visible on the stern , the cruise ship 's blue and white paint was scorched and mottled , the white stars on her two smokestacks blackened by heat and soot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;14	Although crippled , the Achille Lauro appeared in no danger of sinking quickly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;15	The ship was listing at about 20 degrees , John Briand , captain of the oil tanker Lima , told the BBC .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;16	The fire started Wednesday , apparently in the passenger area , but the cause was not known , said the ship 's owner , Starlauro of Genoa , Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;17	But Dmitrios Skapinkais , the Greek captain of the Treasure Island , said the liner 's captain , who came aboard to use his ship 's radiotelephone , said the fire started in the engine room .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;18	Eight people were injured in the fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;19	About 60 crewmembers fought the fire before abandoning the 23,478-ton ship 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- south of the Horn of Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;20	The pilot of a plane carrying an Associated Press reporter and cameramen put the ship 's position at 160 miles east of the small Somali fishing village of Eil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;21	Capt. Ferdinando Lolli , a port official in Rome , said the ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;22	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch and British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;23	Late Wednesday evening , Italian Coast Guard officials reported that everyone on the Achille Lauro was accounted for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;24	Starlauro identified the dead as a Briton and a German .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;25	The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian King was one of the first ships to arrive at the scene and took on about 800 people , said a coast guard official in Rome , Adm. Eugenio Sicurezza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;26	`` Quite a few people were injured in the transfer -- there 's a few broken bones and some pretty tortured souls , '' Briand said , adding that many of the rescued passengers were elderly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;27	Many had to spend the night on the Hawaiian King 's deck , Briand said , and other ships sent over food , blankets and toiletries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;28	Two U.S. warships , the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton , arrived overnight and dispatched helicopters to ferry water , food and medical supplies to the survivors , McCreary said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;29	The Achille Lauro left Genoa on Nov. 19 , stopped in Israel , and its next port of call was to be Durban , South Africa , on Friday , said Carla Gotta , a spokeswoman for the cruise ship 's owner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;30	The terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985 shot American Leon Klinghoffer and pushed him in his wheelchair off the ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;31	The hijackers escaped the vessel and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;32	Launched in 1946 in the Netherlands , the Achille Lauro was acquired 20 years later by the Neapolitan shipping dynasty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;33	It first transported Italian immigrant workers to and from Australia and was outfitted for pleasure cruises in 1970 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;34	The liner rammed a fishing boat in 1971 off Italy , killing a Neapolitan fisherman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;35	And on Dec. 2 , 1981 , fire broke out aboard ship off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0230;36	Panicked passengers jumped into the sea , and two of them drowned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;0	The Union Bank of Switzerland officially opened a representative office in Kuala Lumpur Thursday , saying it saw tremendous prospects for growth in Malaysia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;1	A key task of the office would be to help clients tap into regional and global capital sources , said Lim Ho Kee , the bank 's executive vice president and chief executive officer for East Asia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;2	He said many Malaysian companies were going offshore to develop infrastructure projects , for which UBS could be the financier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;3	`` The prospects for growth of UBS Malaysia are tremendous , '' he said at a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;4	UBS began operations in Malaysia with the opening of a research office in Kuala Lumpur in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0231;5	It plans to open a full office soon in Labuan , 1,380 kilometers -LRB- 860 miles -RRB- east of Kuala Lumpur .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;0	Rich countries are expected to grab the biggest share of benefits from an extensive trade liberalizing agreement , while the poor may have to scrabble for crumbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;1	The GATT trade accord , which is meant to take effect Jan. 1 , is forecast to boost global incomes by as much as dlrs 510 billion over the next 10 years and will be the biggest trade bonanza the world has ever seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;2	It will cut barriers to hundreds of thousands of exports ranging from radios to roses , make it easier for companies to win untapped markets , and reduce store prices for consumers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;3	The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade predicts that incomes in the European Union will be boosted by dlrs 164 billion per year and in the United States by dlrs 122 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;4	Gains in Japan are put at dlrs 27 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;5	The forecasts are for 2005 because the accord will be phased in gradually .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;6	GATT predicts that developing countries and transition economies like the former Soviet bloc will share dlrs 116 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;7	But this conceals the fact that some of the poorest nations -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa might actually be worse off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;8	So why the winners and losers ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;9	The lion 's share of the gains in the United States and European Union are expected as a result of the 10-year phase out of textile and clothing import quotas which protect domestic industries from cheaper Third World competition and raise prices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;10	Asian and Latin American countries , which have been infuriated by the limits on their exports , are expected to benefit from the liberalization , though it does n't go as far as they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;11	In the short term it will be painful for local U.S. and European industries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;12	A U.S. government study last year said nearly 47,000 jobs might be lost in the clothing sector alone -- about 6 percent of its total employment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;13	But in the long term , jobs lost in the textiles sector will be recreated in more efficient industries , leading to a better use of resources and more wealth -- at least in theory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;14	The price of clothing for American families is expected to fall by 11 percent once the restrictions end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;15	Efficient food producers in Canada , Australia and Brazil are rubbing their hands at the prospect of bigger exports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;16	The trade accord cuts back subsidies over a six-year period to European and American farmers who have used the government grants to undercut competitors on world markets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;17	French farmers in particular are outraged at the perceived threat to their livelihood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;18	And there have been repeated riots in Japan and South Korea in support of rice farmers who will for the first time face foreign competition , albeit on a limited scale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;19	But it should good news to taxpayers and consumers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;20	For instance , the average cow in the United States and Europe gets more government funds than many Third World workers earn in a year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;21	Inflated prices in shops should also be cut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;22	Ironically , the immediate impact may be the opposite in some poor African food importing nations , which are clamoring for compensation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;23	For example , Egypt imports dlrs 1 billion worth of subsidized cereals each year from the United States and Europe and expects price increases once those subsidies are cut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;24	This loss will be only partly offset by more open markets in Europe for Egyptian fruit and vegetables .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;25	Europe has kept its doors open to products from former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean under a preferential deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;26	The benefits of this are expected to dry up as other countries gain more access to European markets under the GATT accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;27	And if freer trade drives down already weak prices for commodities like cocoa and coffee , then some African nations may be double or triple losers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;28	Charities like the British-based Christian Aid estimate that Africa may end up losing dlrs 3 billion annually within the next ten years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;29	Other studies indicate the losses will be much smaller .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;30	`` North and West Africa will do particularly badly because they are very dependent on preferential trade agreements , because they import a lot of their food and because they are poor and vulnerable , '' says Peter Madden of Christian Aid .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;31	GATT critics also point out that large multinationals are likely to profit at the expense of small producers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;32	This is especially true of the planned new laws to increase patent protection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;33	In India , there have been widespread protests over anticipated royalty payments and increased prices for farm seeds and medicines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0233;34	Mistrust of the GATT accord is so strong in India that it still goes under the title of Dunkel Draft Text -- after former GATT chief Arthur Dunkel -- and is equated with the deadly pesticide `` DDT . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;0	Monaco 's Prince Rainier , who last week underwent double bypass heart surgery , is recovering well and is expected to the leave the hospital early next week , the principality press office said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;1	Rainier , 71 , was in excellent spirits at the principality 's Heart and Thoracic Clinic , eating normally , walking unassisted and receiving daily visits from his family , the statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;2	Rainier is expected to return to his cliffside palace next week to continue to convalesce .
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;3	Dr. Vincent Dor , who performed the open-heart surgery last Friday , called the operation a success .
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;4	The base of Rainier 's left coronary artery had been restricting the flow of blood to and from the heart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0234;5	The press office denied recent rumors that Rainier was about to abdicate in favor of his son , Prince Albert .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;0	With a brief lull in the civil war , the United Nations is trying to send a large relief convoy into Kabul for the first time in six months , an official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;1	Trucks carrying hundreds of tons of food , medicine and plastic sheeting recently left from Pakistan and is now south of the besieged city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;2	U.N. officials are trying to negotiate safe passage across the front line in south Kabul , said a U.N. official who requested anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;3	Opposition leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar controls the main roads leading into the city and no large convoys can reach Kabul without his approval .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;4	And as winter descends on Kabul , the food situation is expected to worsen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;5	The city 's food is now being supplied mostly by traders who cross the front line daily to buy flour , wood and gasoline from merchants in opposition-held territory to the south and the east of Kabul .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;6	There 's enough food available , but prices have skyrocketed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;7	If the U.N. effort is successful , the convoy could reach Kabul this weekend .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;8	It would be the first U.N. relief convoy to reach the capital since June .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;9	Hekmatyar 's forces tightened their blockade last winter and food supplies were running low until U.N. Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali made a personal appeal to Hekmatyar , who then eased the roadblocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;10	But many Afghans are critical of the United Nations , which removed its international staff from Kabul when heavy fighting erupted in January .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;11	A small staff made up entirely of Afghans now handles the limited U.N. operation in Kabul , while the U.N. 's international staff remains in Pakistan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;12	President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government controls most of the capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0235;13	But nine separate Islamic factions remain locked in a bitter battle that broke out after the groups ousted a Communist government in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;0	Two more journalists have been assassinated in Algeria , security forces said Thursday , bringing the death toll among journalists to about two dozen since the profession became a target of Islamic militants 18 months ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;1	The latest victims were Ahmed Issaad , a reporter for state television , and Nasseredine Lekhal , a journalist with the state-run daily El-Massa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;2	They were stabbed to death Wednesday in Boufarik , south of Algiers , security forces said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;3	More than 11,000 people have been killed in a three-year insurgency pitting Muslim fundamentalist militants against the army-backed government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;4	The toll sharply increased in November , with more than 400 people killed in the bloodiest month since the start of the insurgency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;5	Most of the known victims for November were extremists killed by security forces , ordered to step up their campaign to `` eradicate terrorists '' after a failed government effort to negotiate with fundamentalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;6	The militants , depicting the media as government pawns , have designated journalists as a prime target of their assassination campaign , along with foreigners and intellectuals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;7	About two dozen journalists have been murdered since May 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;8	Security forces said three other people were killed Wednesday along with the two journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;9	Among them were the vice president and a member of Boufarik 's municipal council , appointed to replace fundamentalists elected but later banned from office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;10	An estimated 200 Algerian journalists have left the country because of the killings and harsh government action against newspapers which violate strict security regulations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;11	Some 600 Islamic sympathizers remain in detention in a Sahara desert camp , the president of the government Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;12	In a sweeping roundup , Algeria placed at least 10,000 suspected fundamentalist sympathizers in seven desert camps after the February 1992 state of emergency was declared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0236;13	Kamel Rezzag-Bara said one center holding 600 prisoners was still in operation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;0	A Russian ultimatum demanding an end to Chechnya 's civil war expired today amid signs that Moscow was preparing to send troops into the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;1	A trickle of heavily loaded cars and trucks left the capital this morning as civilians headed for the countryside , fearing an attack by Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;2	Central Grozny was virtually empty following another nerve-jangling night of intermittent gunfire from jumpy fighters around the city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;3	A military jet roared over the capital as the Russian deadline passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;4	Later , heavy machine-gun fire rang out from the city center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;5	The fighting in this republic of 1.2 million people pits forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who has declared Chechnya independent from Russia , against rebels who the maverick general says are armed and led by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;6	President Boris Yeltsin ordered warring Chechens to lay down their arms and release all prisoners by this morning or face Russian military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;7	Dudayev and his forces defied the ultimatum .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;8	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade-launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;9	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;10	Russian media reported troop movements around the borders of Chechnya , in the Caucasus Mountains region 650 miles southeast of Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;11	The Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said Russian army units would support Interior Ministry forces to `` ensure stability in the region , safety of the population and avert the spread of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;12	The conflict is the latest to underline tensions among the scores of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;13	The Caucasus region has been especially fractious , with fighting in the Ossetian and Abkhazian regions of Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;14	For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;15	No other region has gone as far as Chechnya and declared independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;16	Moscow openly supports Dudayev 's opponents politically , but denies offering military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;17	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters Saturday , Moscow said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;18	In Moscow , Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslev Kostikov said Moscow had begun `` a series of measures '' to resolve the crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;19	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' he said , referring to those captured Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;20	He did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;21	Grozny 's central bazaar , which once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty today .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;22	A few elderly women trudged around in search of bread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;23	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0238;24	Wrapped in an old leather coat and a scarf , 60-year-old Tamara Ofsayeva walked among the bazaar 's empty stalls and said Russia would have a tough time overrunning Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0239;0	President Clinton to name outgoing Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell special adviser for economic initiatives in Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;0	Yasser Arafat 's government took control of tax collection in the West Bank on Thursday , the latest step in transferring the day-to-day administration of the Palestinian territories to the PLO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;1	The Palestine Liberation Organization , which runs the 6-month-old autonomy arrangement in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho , has in recent months taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;2	Taxes and the health system , which is to be turned over later Thursday , complete the initial stage of self-rule , allowing Palestinians to control most aspects of their lives despite continued Israeli occupation in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;3	`` What we have completed gives the Palestinians a first entrance to the West Bank , '' said West Bank military governor Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar , signing over the tax department to Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;4	The move came days before Israel and the PLO were to begin difficult negotiations on the next stage of autonomy -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;5	Israel is worried that the PLO can not guarantee the safety of the 120,000 Jewish settlers once the army pulls out of Palestinian towns as stipulated in their peace accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;6	There are calls to renegotiate the agreement , including a proposal Wednesday by Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin to skip the interim phase altogether and begin talks now on the final status of the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;7	This coincides with a growing desire among Israelis for greater separation from the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;8	Police Minister Moshe Shahal on Thursday called for a complete closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip once troops redeploy in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;9	He spoke a day after a Palestinian from the West Bank killed a 19-year-old woman soldier with an ax in northern Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;10	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;11	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;12	A closure would prevent 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza , including tens of thousands of day workers , from entering Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;13	Palestinian tax officials said Thursday their goal was to make their impoverished autonomy administration self-sufficient .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;14	`` We can not depend for the rest of our lives on the donor countries and the foreign investors in building our Palestinian state , '' said Deputy Finance Minister Atef Alawneh .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;15	In Brussels , foreign donors this week released dlrs 125 million already promised to the PLO , mostly to help the Palestinians meet running costs for a few months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;16	Alawneh said he eventually hoped to raise dlrs 300 million to dlrs 400 million annually in taxes , much more than the sum raised by Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;17	During the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation , many Palestinians refused to pay taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;18	Israel retaliated by denying tax evaders documents such as drivers ' licenses and travel papers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;19	Soldiers accompanied tax collectors in night raids to confiscate goods from Palestinian homes in lieu of payment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;20	The West Bank town of Beit Zahour staged a collective tax revolt , becoming the target of many such raids .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;21	George Rishmawi , a Beit Zahour textile factory owner , said he hoped the Palestinians would adopt a different policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;22	`` We hope the whole system will be changed and we will start a new era , '' said Rishmawi , who was jailed for three months for not paying taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;23	`` We have paid the Israelis enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;24	They ripped us off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;25	They were thieves with licenses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0240;26	Alawneh said tax debts going back to the Israeli era would not be forgiven , and only fines and interest would be canceled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday approved an American proposal to draw up a blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of former Warsaw Pact foes as new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;1	After a turnaround in U.S. policy , they also agreed to relaunch diplomatic efforts to end the Bosnian war -- steering away from Washington 's previous calls to step up air strikes on the Serbs and end the ban on arms supplies to the Muslim-led government in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;2	The ministers endorsed a 12-month study to consider how to expand the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;3	Issues will include financing , integrating the newcomers ' armies and nuclear issues , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;4	Anxious to ease Russian fears about the expansion , the foreign ministers emphasized the alliance was not trying to create a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;5	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in their final communique .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;6	The plan to open up to the East was to be the centerpiece of the two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;7	But unprecedented strains between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia overshadowed the talks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;8	In an effort to heal the divisions , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;9	`` An agreement has been reached on the idea of relaunching the negotiations , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;10	Juppe said he hoped a meeting Friday with Christopher and the foreign ministers of Germany , Britain and Russia would launch `` a new initiative '' to end the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;11	Juppe added he will travel to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;12	However , in an apparent attempt to beef up its air power over Bosnia , NATO has asked Germany to add its warplanes to the allied forces on hand in case air strikes are called against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;13	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government was considering the request .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;14	The request is highly sensitive because of Germany 's postwar pacifist tradition , and the history of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans during World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;15	The foreign ministers were anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;16	They ordered a study that would set out the terms for the acceptance of East European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;17	It should be ready when the ministers meet in Brussels a year from now .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;18	The United States had initially proposed a six-month study of enlargement , but the Europeans , mindful of Russia 's fears of isolation , extended it to 12 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;19	`` We should avoid premature enlargement that gives the impression that we seek a redivision of the European continent , '' said Juppe , according to a spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;20	The study will not name candidates for membership -- although Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners -- nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;21	`` It is premature to discuss the timeframe for enlargement or which particular countries would be invited to join the alliance , '' the final communique said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;22	Instead , the study will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;23	To counter Russian worries about NATO 's eastward expansion , the allies intend on Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Moscow and agree to hold regular talks on security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;24	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , ministers could not avoid the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;25	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that may allow Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;26	That plan requires them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;27	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;28	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0241;29	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0242;0	President Clinton will name retiring Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to be a special adviser for economic initiatives in Ireland , White House officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0242;1	The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the appointment will be part-time , and not tied directly to peace talks between Britain and Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0242;2	Mitchell , who did not run for re-election , will not be involved in the peace talks between Britain and Northern Ireland , the source said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;0	Clashes among rival political groups left at least four persons dead and 20 injured Thursday in two states legislature polls seen as a test of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's popularity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;1	The clashes occurred mostly in Andhra Pradesh , the home state of Rao , where leftist guerrillas called for a boycott of the elections in their northern stronghold to protest successive corrupt governments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;2	The neighboring state of Karnataka was peaceful .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;3	But one political activist was killed when a mob hurled rocks at him while he tried to mobilize voters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;4	Polling was considered to be peaceful by Indian standards , where dozens of people have in the past been killed on the day of the balloting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;5	More than half of the 38 million voters cast their ballots across the two states Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;6	In Andhra Pradesh , police said they also killed three militants of the Peoples War Group , a rebel group fighting for poor farmers that carried out a series of sabotage incidents in the final weeks of the campaign to disrupt the voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;7	At least 29 people were killed in land mine explosions blamed on the group .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;8	Two of the deaths in the state were blamed on explosives hurled during clashes political rivals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;9	The third death occurred when a truck carrying crude bombs and activists of the Telugu Desam Party overturned while being chased by police .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;10	Four of the 38 bombs exploded and killed one person and injured another , police said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;11	Police received many cases of villagers looting ballot boxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;12	Voting for state legislatures in the two south Indian states was seen as an important bellwether for Congress , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;13	A loss in Rao 's own state could unleash rivalries in the governing party that he suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;14	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for elections in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0244;15	The voting is staggered to allow police forces to move from one to another to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;0	A Russian ultimatum demanding an end to Chechnya 's civil war expired early Thursday but Moscow appeared to back away from threats to send troops into the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;1	Russia had threatened on Tuesday to impose a state of emergency on the Caucasus Mountain region if its president , Dzhokhar Dudayev , and the rebels opposing him do not surrender prisoners and stop fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;2	Neither side showed any indication of doing so .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;3	But on Thursday evening , President Boris Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of Yeltsin 's original ultimatum saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses of the document . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;4	The reissued document skipped all reference to any introduction of a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;5	Meanwhile , Yeltsin issued a limited amnesty to Chechens who lay down their arms and are not implicated in grave crimes against civilians , ITAR-Tass said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;6	A delegation of Russian lawmakers and other leaders arrived in Grozny on Thursday afternoon and began closed-door talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;7	In Grozny , jet flyovers jangled nerves for a third day , and dropped bombs at least once .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;8	Dudayev , looking tired under neon lights in the basement of his presidential palace , told a news conference his house had been bombed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;9	A small airport near the city was hit Thursday and a woman 's corpse was seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;10	The ITAR-Tass news agency said two women were killed in the raid at the military air base , and fuel depots were burning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;11	Meanwhile , a trickle of heavily loaded cars and trucks continued leaving Grozny before a feared attack by Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;12	Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991 , soon after Dudayev 's election .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;13	The fighting , which intensified last week after months of skirmishes , pits forces loyal to Dudayev against the rebels , who Dudayev says are armed and led by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;14	Moscow openly supports Dudayev 's opponents politically , but denies offering military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;15	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters Saturday , Moscow said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;16	A single military jet roared over Grozny as the Russian deadline passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;17	Later , heavy machine-gun fire rang out from the city center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;18	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;19	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots , danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;20	Russian media reported troop movements around the borders of Chechnya , in southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;21	The Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said Russian army units would support Interior Ministry forces to `` ensure stability in the region , safety of the population and avert the spread of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;22	The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;23	The Caucasus region has been especially fractious , with fighting in the Ossetian and Abkhazian regions of Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;24	For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;25	No other region has gone as far as Chechnya and declared independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;26	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' Yeltsin 's spokesman Vyascheslav Kostikov said , referring to those captured Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;27	Dudayev told reporters the prisoners would be `` judged by a court . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;28	Most of the residents fleeing Grozny went only a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- to stay with relatives in the countryside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;29	`` Already , the majority of people have left the city , '' said 43-year-old Lyuba Ishkirchira , a Russian woman married to an ethnic Bashkir .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;30	`` I have no relatives to go to , and my father and mother are ill here -- I can not leave them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;31	Grozny 's central bazaar , once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;32	A few old women trudged through the mud and wet leaves in search of bread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;33	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : Distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;34	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said one restaurant owner who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;35	Wrapped in an old leather coat and a thick , gray scarf , a 60-year-old Chechen woman walking among the bazaar 's empty stalls said Russia would have a tough time trying to overrun Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0245;36	`` Whoever fights the Muslims never wins , '' Tamara Ofsayeva said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;0	The Clinton administration has swung to the viewpoint of NATO allies that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;1	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;2	It is the first time in the post-World War II history of the alliance that the Europeans led by France prevailed over the United States in formulating a major policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;3	It is a difficult assignment for Christopher , putting him in the awkward position of shifting gears even while denying U.S. policy on the war has changed or that there is a trans-Atlantic rift .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;4	Trying to patch over the embarrassing dispute , Christopher pronounced the alliance strong and he charted a plan for growth through absorption of East European countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;5	A ceremony was scheduled to establish links to Russia , for decades the direct target of NATO 's massive military preparedness program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;6	The plan was adopted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;7	Over the next 12 months , bureaucrats will study the financial , structural and nuclear implications of taking in Eastern and Central European countries -- despite Russia 's reservations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;8	Christopher told the allies in a speech that `` the tragedy of the war and bloodshed in Bosnia does not diminish our responsibility to build a comprehensive European security architecture . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;9	`` America 's interests in Europe have not changed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;10	`` Neither have the basic principles guiding our engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;11	And at the top of the list , Christopher said today , was that `` the United States has enduring political , military , economic and cultural links to Europe that must and will be preserved . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;12	Earlier , at breakfast with Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;13	Christopher and Hurd said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;14	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;15	However , his aides spread the word a trip by Christopher to Belgrade was unlikely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;16	Asked if the troops would be withdrawn , Hurd replied grimly : `` We certainly hope not . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;17	By chance , it was the Unites States ' turn to preside over a meeting today of the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's policy-making arm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;18	This puts Christopher under an even brighter spotlight , and he was responding both with a brief speech opening the session and a detailed one outlining U.S. plans for NATO 's expansion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;19	On Friday , Christopher intends to lay out the U.S. approach to the Bosnian war in a meeting with Hurd and Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe of France , Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and Klaus Kinkel of Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;20	It is centered on a call for an international peace conference that would give the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity to demand changes in the peace plan they have rejected repeatedly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;21	They already have strong intimations of support from the Clinton administration in pressing for cross-border political ties to the Serb-dominated government in Belgrade -- a big step toward their goal of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;22	`` This alliance will continue to be the anchor of American engagement in Europe , the linchpin of trans-Atlantic security , '' Christopher said in a brief statement opening the North Atlantic Council session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;23	He also assured the 15 foreign ministers that the Clinton administration was committed to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe `` as part of our continuing engagement . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;24	The European allies , particularly France and Britain , have managed to limit NATO air strikes despite U.N. assurances that Bihac , the mostly Muslim town on the verge of falling to the Serbs , was a `` safe area '' from which heavy weapons were to be excluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;25	They also hemmed in the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;26	Christopher , having threatened the Serbs in the past with NATO might , abandoned the threat when asked what `` sticks '' the United States was using to persuade the Serbs to relinquish their grip on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;27	If they kept fighting , Christopher said , they risked Serbia closing its border and a tightening of sanctions -- measures that are far less threatening than attacks by NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;28	Seeking to limit the damage to the alliance , which successfully stood up to the Soviet Union but has caved on Bosnia , Christopher said he wanted to stress that `` the crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia ; it 's not about NATO and its future . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;29	The other foreign ministers eagerly joined in his campaign to smooth over the disagreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;30	`` We had a lot of tension in the past few days , '' Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;31	`` Fortunately , this has passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;32	We all agree the only way to end this conflict is in a negotiated way . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;33	Kinkel , the German foreign minister , acknowledged U.S. policy on Bosnia had changed , and on dealing with the expansion of NATO as well .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;34	German Ambassador Hermann von Richthofen had filed a cable to his foreign ministry accusing the United States of sowing mistrust over Bosnia and the eastward expansion of the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0246;35	It is `` divided and in crisis , '' he concluded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;0	The planned European Union-wide police force will not have its marching orders this year , as the dozen governments ended talks Thursday by failing to agree on rules for Europol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;1	Despite growing public concern about organized crime and international drug trafficking , justice and interior ministers here for a 2-day meeting again spent it squabbling over details on how to coordinate their police forces .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;2	The ministers have already missed an October deadline for adopting a convention for the Netherlands-based Europol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;3	Germany has sought an FBI-style agency , independent and with a long arm to track individuals or organizations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;4	But France wants national police forces to have easy access to Europol data , and would limit the exchange of information between member states .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;5	British officials are reluctant to feed sensitive information to a data bank that authorities in other member states can inspect any time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;6	Crime fighting remains the responsibility of individual governments , who have agreed to work together on the subject .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;7	Their lack of progress has caused frustration among EU officials , who remain powerless on the matter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;8	Commissioner Padraig Flynn , the EU 's justice and immigration chief , railed against the ministers Thursday , criticizing their slow pace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;9	`` We have made no progress '' on Europol , he told reporters after the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;10	`` There are some very obvious questions and they have to be faced up to . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;11	Flynn also complained that governments have not yet fixed immigration rules , and that `` nothing has happened '' with a plan to seal the union 's external frontiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0247;12	Both are necessary to allow free movement for people inside the trade bloc , a prime goal of the group 's border-free , single market that took effect Jan. 1 , 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;0	A Russian ultimatum demanding an end to Chechnya 's civil war expired early Thursday but Moscow appeared to back away from threats to send troops into the breakaway southern republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;1	Russia had threatened on Tuesday to impose a state of emergency on the Caucasus Mountain region if its president , Dzhokhar Dudayev , and the rebels opposing him do not surrender prisoners and stop fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;2	Neither side showed any indication of doing so .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;3	But on Thursday evening , President Boris Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of Yeltsin 's original ultimatum saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses of the document . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;4	The reissued document skipped all reference to any introduction of a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;5	Meanwhile , Yeltsin issued a limited amnesty to Chechens who lay down their arms and are not implicated in grave crimes against civilians , ITAR-Tass said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;6	A delegation of Russian lawmakers and other leaders arrived in Grozny on Thursday afternoon and began closed-door talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;7	In Grozny , jet flyovers jangled nerves for a third day , and dropped bombs at least once .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;8	Dudayev , looking tired under neon lights in the basement of his presidential palace , told a news conference his house had been bombed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;9	A small airport near the city was hit Thursday and a woman 's corpse was seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;10	The ITAR-Tass news agency said two women were killed in the raid at the military air base , and fuel depots were burning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;11	Meanwhile , a trickle of heavily loaded cars and trucks continued leaving Grozny before a feared attack by Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;12	Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991 , soon after Dudayev 's election .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;13	The fighting , which intensified last week after months of skirmishes , pits forces loyal to Dudayev against the rebels , who Dudayev says are armed and led by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;14	Moscow openly supports Dudayev 's opponents politically , but denies offering military assistance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;15	After Dudayev 's forces captured Russian fighters Saturday , Moscow said mercenaries were fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;16	A single military jet roared over Grozny as the Russian deadline passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;17	Later , heavy machine-gun fire rang out from the city center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;18	In Freedom Square outside the presidential building , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;19	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots , danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;20	Russian media reported troop movements around the borders of Chechnya , in southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;21	The Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said Russian army units would support Interior Ministry forces to `` ensure stability in the region , safety of the population and avert the spread of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;22	The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;23	The Caucasus region has been especially fractious , with fighting in the Ossetian and Abkhazian regions of Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;24	For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;25	No other region has gone as far as Chechnya and declared independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;26	`` All necessary measures are being taken to save the Russian soldiers , '' Yeltsin 's spokesman Vyascheslav Kostikov said , referring to those captured Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;27	Dudayev told reporters the prisoners would be `` judged by a court . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;28	Most of the residents fleeing Grozny went only a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- to stay with relatives in the countryside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;29	`` Already , the majority of people have left the city , '' said 43-year-old Lyuba Ishkirchira , a Russian woman married to an ethnic Bashkir .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;30	`` I have no relatives to go to , and my father and mother are ill here -- I can not leave them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;31	Grozny 's central bazaar , once thronged with thousands of people , was nearly empty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;32	A few old women trudged through the mud and wet leaves in search of bread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;33	Although the Chechens are fighting among themselves , many agreed that they have one thing in common : Distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;34	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said one restaurant owner who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;35	Wrapped in an old leather coat and a thick , gray scarf , a 60-year-old Chechen woman walking among the bazaar 's empty stalls said Russia would have a tough time trying to overrun Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0248;36	`` Whoever fights the Muslims never wins , '' Tamara Ofsayeva said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;0	President Clinton will name retiring Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to be a special adviser for economic initiatives in Ireland , White House officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;1	The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the appointment will be part-time , and not tied directly to peace talks between Britain and Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;2	Mitchell , who did not run for re-election , will not be involved in the peace talks between Britain and Northern Ireland , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;3	Mitchell will be a special adviser to the president and the secretary of state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;4	The Maine Democrat is ending a 12-year Senate career after the Senate votes Thursday on ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact .
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;5	Even if Mitchell had run for re
APW_ENG_19941201.0249;6	In addition to being majority leader , Mitchell has served on the Senate Finance Committee and its subcommittee on international trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0250;0	Air services are soon to begin between Dubai and the Comoros following the signing Thursday of a memorandum of understanding between the two governments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0250;1	The national airline , Emirates , is expected to operate the service .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;0	Unions extracted concessions from Premier Silvio Berlusconi 's government Thursday in exchange for calling off a general strike .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;1	The agreement , reached during all-night talks , was a big step toward gaining support from the leftist opposition in the Senate for approval of the deficit-reducing budget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;2	`` The pension war is over , '' said Berlusconi told a news conference after emerging from a meeting with his Cabinet and union leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;3	The unions declared themselves satisfied with the settlement and revoked a strike set for Friday which would have been the second general strike in six weeks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;4	The agreement restores so-called old age pensions giving the green light to people with 35 years of work under their belt to receive full pension benefits .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;5	It also includes measures that will increase social security benefits for large or poor families and provide more assistance to Italy 's less industrialized southern regions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;6	However , Berlusconi insisted the government had not backed down on its austerity plan and still intended to cut 50 trillion lire -LRB- dlrs 31 billion -RRB- of the country 's dlrs 100 billion budget-deficit as planned .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;7	`` I have always said that not one , not two , not even 10 strikes would have modified the figures -LRB- of the budget cuts -RRB- , '' said Berlusconi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;8	As part of the agreement the government pledged to turn its attention to a full-scale permanent pension reform that would bring Italy 's generous welfare and pension system in line with other European countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;9	The reforms must be approved by June 30 if the accord between the government and unions is respected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;10	`` More money is taken out of the social security safe than what gets put in ... and it 's not possible to continue like this , '' Berlusconi said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;11	`` We are talking about a very satisfactory agreement that concludes a complex dispute , '' Giancarlo Fontanelli leader of the UIL union told the ANSA news agency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;12	The budget is being discussed in the Senate after it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Nov. 16 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0251;13	The Berlusconi government has a comfortable majority in the chamber but falls just short in the Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;0	In a further challenge to the crumbling U.N. bid to stop fighting in Bosnia , Serb forces on Thursday detained peacekeepers , blocked humanitarian supplies and fired missiles at Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;1	In embattled northwest Bosnia , where Serb forces have nearly surrounded the Muslim enclave of Bihac , machine-gun and small-arms fire raged a day after a failed peace mission by U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;2	Military intervention by the allies on behalf of the besieged Muslim-led government grew more unlikely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;3	In Brussels , Belgium , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told NATO allies the Clinton administration now agrees with European allies that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;4	U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia , that Bosnian Serb units crossed into Croatia and kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;5	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;6	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has not been able to make contact with its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;7	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes following three allied bombing raids on Serb targets last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;8	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs ignored 21 requests to allow food and fuel supply convoys to pass through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;9	He said U.N. supplies were running low in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;10	Humanitarian convoys were also blocked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;11	In downtown Sarajevo , two buildings of the Interior Ministry were hit by anti-tank missiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;12	Four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;13	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed because Serbs denied flight clearance , ruling out any relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;14	Neither side seemed ready for peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;15	The Bosnian government rejected a cease-fire plan proposed by Boutros-Ghali during a brief visit on Wednesday , and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused even to meet with the U.N. chief .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;16	The intransigence on both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;17	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan that they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;18	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire , but Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;19	Comments by the Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;20	He said Bihac would not fall , and that the Bosnian army eventually would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;21	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;22	Radovan would not come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali refused to enter Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;23	But the U.N. chief executive will be in Geneva between Friday and Sunday to `` continue his intensive diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution , especially for a cease-fire '' in Bosnia , his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;24	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;25	Ivanko said later that Bosnian Serb forces kept the heat on the government 's hard-pressed 5th Corps , with significant fighting reported to the southwest and south of the Bihac pocket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;26	But there was no immediate information on any changes in the frontlines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;27	Serbs are holding 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;28	One civilian was killed near the Bihac stadium by small-arms fire , while a number of shells exploded near the Bihac hospital , badly injuring one person , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;29	In Brussels , Christopher and Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;30	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;31	Some senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they long have desired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;32	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;33	At a breakfast with Hurd , Christopher reviewed the Boutros-Ghali 's warning that that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission , the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;34	The threat reflects a growing frustration as the Serbs continue their assaults and the government refuses new concessions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;35	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0252;36	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict begun by Serbs who rebelled when Muslims and Croats voted for independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;0	Under a furious lobbying barrage from the Clinton administration and a small army of corporate executives , the Senate stood on the verge Thursday of ratifying a sweeping expansion of global free trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;1	The climatic vote will not occur until the end of a second full day of debate , but supporters were claiming they now had an ample number of votes for the agreement itself and , more importantly , a small cushion for the three-fifths majority they need on a budget waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;2	`` By the time the vote is actually taken tonight , we expect GATT will pass , '' said presidential press secretary Dee Dee Myers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;3	While administration officials and Senate supporters said their vote counts showed victory in their grasp , they did not let up in their lobbying efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;4	President Clinton met at the White House with a group of mostly undecided senators in an attempt to build the victory margin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;5	Opponents , while conceding that the momentum was not going their way , did not let up in their efforts , either .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;6	A group of two-dozen protesters , one dressed as a lame-duck , chanted outside the White House as senators arrived for breakfast with Clinton .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;7	Sen. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina said that the new trade agreement was a bad deal that , by lowering trade barriers , would subject American workers to even more unfair competition from low-wage countries , further weakening the country 's economic standing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;8	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;9	Everybody knows that , '' said Hollings , whose home-state textile industry will be one of the biggest losers in the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;10	`` Wake up , Washington . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;11	However , GATT supporters said that the Senate 's choice on the last day of the 103rd Congress was between continuing to hold a position of economic leadership in the global economy or retreating behind protectionist barriers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;12	The House endorsed the accord , negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , by a 288-146 vote on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;13	Thirty-three other countries already have ratified the 124-nation accord and supporters said other countries are poised to act before Jan. 1 if the Senate follows the House .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;14	According to an Associated Press survey , GATT proponents appeared on the verge of victory , when counting those who were leaning in favor but not firmly committed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;15	The AP head count had 60 senators for or leaning for waiving budget rules , 26 against or leaning against and 14 undeclared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;16	Opponents ' only hope was to change enough senators ' minds to muster 41 votes in favor of the procedural hurdle imposed by Sen. Robert Byrd .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;17	Under Senate rules , the implementing bill must offset all of the projected dlrs 43 billion in lost tariff revenues over the first decade of the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;18	To make up for the lost tariffs , the administration is cutting farm subsidies and raising revenue with a number of measures , including changing the minimum rate on savings bonds and auctioning licenses for a new generation of wireless broadcast services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;19	Byrd said the bill falls dlrs 14.5 billion short and some senators , while declaring themselves in favor of free trade , said they would not vote to bust the budget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;20	Byrd and others also complain that a new Geneva-based World Trade Organization , created to referee trade disputes , will inevitably infringe on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;21	The administration is predicting 500,000 new American jobs as a result of increased U.S. export sales under GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;22	In addition to bringing foreign tariffs closer to U.S. levels , it reduces barriers to trade in agricultural goods and services and protects U.S. intellectual property , such as computer programs , from being pirated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0253;23	Opponents charge the trade agreement would simply make it easier for big companies to move more jobs to low-wage countries , including Third World nations where child labor is prevalent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;0	ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- AP -RRB- - The main opposition party on Thursday accused Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 's government of paying bribes to win the support of key politicians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;1	The opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , and Ms. Bhutto have been making charges and counter-charges of corruption for months , and the attacks have become increasingly personal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;2	Both have denied allegations of wrongdoing and none of the charges has been proven in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;3	Sharif told a news conference that Ms. Bhutto , her husband Asif Zardari , and President Farooq Leghari all took part in a scheme that set aside 260 million rupees -LRB- dlrs 8.5 million -RRB- of government money for personal use and for paying bribes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;4	`` The trail of corruption leads to the very top , including Farooq Leghari , Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari , '' Sharif said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;5	Sharif claimed a large chunk of the money was used to buy the support of independent legislators in the Northwest Frontier Provincial Assembly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;6	Sharif 's conservative Pakistan Muslim League headed a coalition that controlled the province until a number of independents defected earlier this year to support Ms. Bhutto 's liberal Pakistan People 's Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;7	Ms. Bhutto 's coalition now controls the province , and Sharif said her party paid bribes to get the independents to switch sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;8	Ms. Bhutto is on a trip to London and was not immediately available for comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;9	She has said repeatedly that her party is not guilty of corruption and has put a stop to abuses initiated by Sharif when he was prime minister from 1990-93 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;10	Even Pakistani politicians acknowledge that the country 's political system is riddled with graft , though they inevitably accuse their opponents of the worst offenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;11	Ms. Bhutto 's government arrested Sharif 's father , Mohammed Sharif , last month on charges of fraud and tax evasion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;12	Ms. Bhutto also said that the Sharif business empire , one of the largest in Pakistan , was built through extensive fraud .
APW_ENG_19941201.0254;13	Sharif 's accusations Thursday were seen largely as a response to Ms. Bhutto 's charges against him and his family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;0	In a further challenge to the crumbling U.N. bid to stop fighting in Bosnia , Serb forces on Thursday detained peacekeepers , blocked humanitarian supplies and fired missiles at Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;1	In embattled northwest Bosnia , where Serb forces have nearly surrounded the Muslim enclave of Bihac , machine-gun and small-arms fire raged a day after a failed peace mission by U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;2	Military intervention by the allies on behalf of the besieged Muslim-led government grew more unlikely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;3	In Brussels , Belgium , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told NATO allies the Clinton administration now agrees with European allies that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;4	U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia , that Bosnian Serb units crossed into Croatia and kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;5	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;6	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has not been able to make contact with its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;7	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes following three allied bombing raids on Serb targets last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;8	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs ignored 21 requests to allow food and fuel supply convoys to pass through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;9	He said U.N. supplies were running low in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;10	Humanitarian convoys were also blocked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;11	In downtown Sarajevo , two buildings of the Interior Ministry were hit by anti-tank missiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;12	Four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;13	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed because Serbs denied flight clearance , ruling out any relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;14	Neither side seemed ready for peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;15	The Bosnian government rejected a cease-fire plan proposed by Boutros-Ghali during a brief visit on Wednesday , and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused even to meet with the U.N. chief .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;16	The intransigence on both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;17	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan that they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;18	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire , but Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;19	Comments by the Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;20	He said Bihac would not fall , and that the Bosnian army eventually would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;21	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;22	Radovan would not come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali refused to enter Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;23	But the U.N. chief executive will be in Geneva between Friday and Sunday to `` continue his intensive diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution , especially for a cease-fire '' in Bosnia , his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;24	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;25	Ivanko said later that Bosnian Serb forces kept the heat on the government 's hard-pressed 5th Corps , with significant fighting reported to the southwest and south of the Bihac pocket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;26	But there was no immediate information on any changes in the frontlines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;27	Serbs are holding 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;28	One civilian was killed near the Bihac stadium by small-arms fire , while a number of shells exploded near the Bihac hospital , badly injuring one person , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;29	In Brussels , Christopher and Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;30	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;31	Some senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they long have desired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;32	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;33	At a breakfast with Hurd , Christopher reviewed the Boutros-Ghali 's warning that that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission , the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;34	The threat reflects a growing frustration as the Serbs continue their assaults and the government refuses new concessions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;35	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0255;36	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict begun by Serbs who rebelled when Muslims and Croats voted for independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;0	American manufacturing surged in November to its strongest level in 10 years , said a widely followed survey of manufacturers released Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;1	The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index of manufacturing growth rose to 61.2 percent in November from 59.7 percent in the previous month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;2	It is the fifteenth consecutive month of growth and the highest reading of the index since February 1984 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;3	A reading above 50 percent indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding , while a reading below 50 percent indicates a decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;4	Factory production advanced to its highest level since December 1983 , indicating that factories are buzzing to keep up with demand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;5	The production index rose to 66.7 percent from 64.2 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;6	The NAPM report 's prices-paid index dipped in November to 77.9 percent from 79.9 percent in October , indicating that manuacturers saw fewer price increases for the raw materials they need .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;7	But the decline was due to seasonal factors , the NAPM said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;8	The price index was at its second highest level in six years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;9	The highest level was in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;10	The purchasing managers assocation , based in Tempe , Ariz. , surveys managers at more than 300 industrial firms nationwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0256;11	The data , which represents the latest evidence on how the economy is performing , is widely followed by economists and the financial markets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;0	U.S. construction spending rose 0.9 percent in October , the second straight gain , but the advance was limited to non-residential and government spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;1	Residential spending , nearly half of construction outlays , fell .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;2	The Commerce Department said Thursday that spending on residential , non-residential and government projects totaled dlrs 518.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate , up from a revised dlrs 513.4 billion in September .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;3	The initial September estimate was dlrs 515.1 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;4	Spending had slipped 0.3 percent in August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;5	But in October , it still was 8.4 percent higher than a year earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;6	Residential spending , 45.4 percent of construction outlays , dropped 1.3 percent to a dlrs 235.2 billion rate , lowest since dlrs 232.3 billion last February .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;7	This sector has been curbed by six interest-rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve this year to slow the economy and contain inflation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;8	Spending on single-family homes slipped 0.8 percent , the fifth consecutive decline as rising mortgage rates continued to dampen consumer demand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;9	Thirty-year mortgages averaged 8.93 percent in October , up from 8.68 percent in September and 6.74 percent a year earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;10	They averaged 9.25 percent last week , highest since 9.27 percent in August 1991 , according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;11	The often-volatile multi-family spending plunged 12.2 percent , nearly wiping out a 13.9 percent surge a month earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;12	Non-residential outlays rose 0.9 percent , to a dlrs 101.7 billion rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;13	The increase was led by a 0.9 percent advance in spending on industrial buildings , a 0.6 percent gain in `` other commercial '' that includes shopping centers and a 5.7 percent boost in hotel and motel outlays .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;14	Government spending increased for the sixth straight month , rising 4.2 percent to a dlrs 137.6 billion rate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0258;15	Outlays for public housing and redevelopment were up 14.6 percent ; schools , 8.7 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;0	City Fathers have decided to spice up this town 's night life by letting bars stay open as late as 4 a.m.
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;1	`` We have to compete with cities like Berlin where cafes can stay open until whenever .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;2	They are big competition , '' Joop Brouwer of the city 's restaurant and cafe owners ' interest group , said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;3	`` We want to have more offerings for our tourists . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;4	Council members voted Wednesday to permit cafes and bars to push back closing times by an hour , so that the latest they can stay open is 4 a.m. on weekends and 3 a.m. during the week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;5	`` Lots of tourists come to Amsterdam and this will allow them more possibilities when going out in the evenings , '' said city council spokesman Martin Lekkerkerker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;6	The new regulations , effective Jan. 1 , were also sought by locals tired of their neighborhood bars closing down just when they wanted another beer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;7	`` Most young people do n't go until after midnight these days , '' said Brouwer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;8	`` Cafes and bars are empty sometimes during the early evening hours and by the time customers come in later , owners have to close . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0259;9	There are about 2,850 cafes in the city , said Lekkerkerker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;0	Bosnian Serbs crossed into Croatia and kidnapped U.N. peacekeepers today , in a further challenge to the United Nations ' crumbling efforts to keep control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;1	A day after U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali 's failed peace mission , the Serbs also repeatedly ignored a U.N. request to allow convoys with food and fuel to pass through Serb-held territory , the United Nations said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;2	Serbs also fired missiles at Sarajevo and traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire with government troops around embattled Bihac , the U.N. declared `` safe area '' in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;3	The seven Ukrainian peacekeepers kidnapped in Croatia , along with a U.N. armored carrier , were taken to Serb-held territory , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;4	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has been unable to contact its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;5	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;6	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs failed to respond to 21 requests to allow the passage of its convoys .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;7	He said food and fuel supplies for the United Nations were running low in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .

APW_ENG_19941201.0260;10	Four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;11	In the Bihac area , Bosnian Serb forces kept the heat on the government 's hard-pressed 5th Corps , with significant fighting reported to the southwest and south of the Bihac pocket , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;12	But there was no immediate information on any changes in the front lines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;13	Serbs are holding 30 percent to 40 percent of the so-called safe area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;14	The Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic , pledged that despite recent losses , Bihac would not fall into Serb hands and the government would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;15	His comments , published in a Sarajevo newspaper today , underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further to reach a cease-fire and a comprehensive peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;16	Boutros-Ghali has warned that the U.N. may have to withdraw its peacekeepers if fighting continues , but the Serbs -- who refused to even meet with the secretary-general Wednesday -- seem unfazed by that prospect .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;17	A withdrawal would likely lead to more fighting and could be dangerous for the departing troops , as both Bosnian Serbs and government forces rush U.N. camps to seize equipment before it can be destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;18	It also would cause widespread hardship because the United Nations feeds an estimated 3 million people across the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;19	Most are in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;20	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher told NATO allies today that the Clinton administration now agrees with its European allies that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;21	Christopher and Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , said they may go to Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;22	`` We will redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;23	Russia 's foreign minister , Andrei Kozyrev , said in Paris today that diplomatic alternatives remained to be explored .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;24	`` We see some elements which could be promoted , tendencies which are encouraging , '' Kozyrev told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;25	But NATO continues to prepare for the possibility of more airstrikes against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;26	Today it asked Germany to contribute fighter planes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;27	The move would engage Germany 's military in its first hot war in 49 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;28	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the 2 -LCB- - year Bosnian conflict launched by Serbs after Bosnia 's Muslim-Croat majority voted to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0260;29	Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their war-won land holdings to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;0	In a sweeping cost-cutting effort , Chemical Banking Corp. said Thursday that it will eliminate 3,700 positions , sell off most of its New Jersey operations and put nearly dlrs 1 billion in bad realty loans on the block .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;1	The actions will cost the nation 's fourth largest banking company approximately dlrs 410 million before taxes in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 30 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;2	That includes dlrs 260 million for severance and eliminating certain facilities and dlrs 150 million for the cost of selling bad realty loans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;3	Chemical said the moves , which were expected , will reduce expenses by dlrs 440 million , with dlrs 210 million of the savings realized this year and dlrs 230 million recorded next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;4	The cost-cutting program will allow Chemical to get out of businesses that do n't generate enough revenues and concentrate investments on areas that yield bigger profits .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;5	To this end , Chemical said it will spend dlrs 180 million over the next two years on `` high growth businesses , '' including corporate and investment banking and national consumer services such as mortgage lending and credit cards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;6	The workforce reductions account for 9 percent of the bank 's 42,500 employees worldwide and will be achieved through attrition and layoffs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;7	Around half of the planned job cuts , to be carried out over the next two years , will occur in Chemical 's New York headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;8	The other half will come from operations in Texas , where Chemical owns a bank , and from other locations around the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;9	The reductions do not include employees who work for Chemical Bank New Jersey , based in East Brunswick , according to spokesman Ken Herz .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;10	The bank will sell 60 percent of the operation , retaining branches located in the northeast quadrant of the state nearest to New York City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;11	Chemical Bank New Jersey has 140 branches and employs over 2,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;12	Herz declined to comment about whether the bank is in talks with potential buyers for the operation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;13	Chemical also wants to sell its 40 percent stake in the CIT Group Holdings Inc. , a New Jersey-based lending company .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;14	Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan owns the other 60 percent of CIT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;15	Chemical has been struggling to reduce its expense base ever since it merged with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;16	The bank eliminated 6,200 jobs after the merger and closed more than 80 overlapping branches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0261;17	In January , the bank announced that it would close another 50 branches because many customers are banking by telephone , computer or at automated teller machines , rather than at branches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;0	Three Italians working for a wood company have been kidnapped by separatist guerrillas in the northern Angolan enclave of Cabinda , an army spokesman said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;1	According to Col. Manuel Paiva , the three employees of the Trivestral timber processing company were seized Tuesday by a group of soldiers about 40 kilometers -LRB- 24 miles -RRB- from the capital , Cabinda , on the road to the town of Tandu Zinze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;2	Paiva said the fighters belonged to FLEC-Renovada -- one of the four factions of the Cabinda Enclave Liberation Front , which wants independence for the tiny , oil-rich province 380 kilometers -LRB- 235 miles -RRB- north of Luanda , separated from Angola proper by Zaire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;3	He did not release the trio 's names but said the army 's 15,000-strong force in the enclave were trying to locate them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;4	He said he assumed they were still alive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;5	Trivestral is a company which fells and processes tropical wood from Cabinda 's jungles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;6	Paiva said FLEC-Renovada , which recently has been fighting alongside the larger National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , or UNITA , counted between 150 and 200 men in the province .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;7	Angola 's war erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;8	Fighting , mainly between the government and UNITA , has killed a half-million Angolans and left millions more threatened by starvation and disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;9	UNITA and FLEC have both taken foreign hostages in the past .
APW_ENG_19941201.0262;10	Last month , a UNITA ambush killed two Portuguese working in the northern provinces for Angolan state companies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;0	A Jerusalem court on Thursday barred eight Jewish extremists from entering the Temple Mount after they illegally prayed at the holy site earlier this week and were kicked out by angry Muslim guards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;1	The eight may not visit the Temple Mount during Jewish holidays for the next six months , ruled Magistrate 's Court Judge Miriam Mizrahi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;2	The Temple Mount is among the flashpoints of the Arab-Israeli conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;3	The raised platform , once site of the Jewish Temple that was destroyed in A.D. 70 , today houses Al Aqsa Mosque , the third holiest shrine of Islam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;4	Jewish extremists demand that Israel expel the Muslims from the Temple Mount and rebuild the temple there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;5	Generally , Jews can visit the Temple Mount , but can not pray there in groups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;6	On Tuesday , Jewish extremists from the group `` Hai Vekayam '' -LRB- Alive and Well -RRB- held a Jewish prayer session on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;7	They were grabbed by Muslim guards and worshipers and kicked out amid curses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;8	The leader of the group , Yehuda Etzion , said Thursday that Jews must demonstrate their presence on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;9	`` The right of Jews to pray on the Temple Mount is interpreted by us as an obligation and not just a right , '' Etzion told Israel radio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;10	Etzion was a leader of an underground ring that waged a four-year campaign of terror against Palestinians in the 1980s , including car bombings that maimed two West Bank mayors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0263;11	He served four years in prison for conspiracy in an aborted plot to blow up the Dome of the Rock Mosque , which is also on the Temple Mount .
APW_ENG_19941201.0264;0	Stocks were mostly lower after one hour of trading Thursday morning as bonds lost ground after the government reported a surge in personal income .

APW_ENG_19941201.0264;8	The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down about dlrs 2 per dlrs 1,000 face value and yielding 8.01 percent , following a Commerce Department report that Americans ' income surged 1.4 percent in October , the ninth straight increase and the biggest jump in eight months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0264;9	In another report , the Labor Department said first-time filing for state unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in two months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0264;10	The increases reported Thursday for both income and spending were higher than many analysts predicted , indicating that the economy may be growing at an inflationary pace and encouraging the Federal Reserve to further tighten short-term interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0264;11	`` I think there 's an aura of caution out there , '' said Alan Ackerman , executive vice president at Reich and Co. `` I 'm not satisfied that there is a major inflation or interest-rate reality ahead , but I am convinced that the scare aspect of this is real , and this morning 's numbers possibly rekindled those fears .

APW_ENG_19941201.0265;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday agreed to try to restart negotiations to end the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;1	They also approved a proposal to study how to expand the alliance to include former Warsaw Pact foes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;2	The plan to open up to the East was to be the centerpiece of the two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;3	But unprecedented strains between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia overshadowed the talks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;4	After a turnaround in U.S. policy , NATO ministers also agreed to relaunch diplomatic efforts to end the Bosnian war -- steering away from Washington 's previous calls to step up air strikes on the Serbs and end the ban on arms supplies to the Muslim-led government in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;5	In an effort to heal the divisions , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;6	`` An agreement has been reached on the idea of relaunching the negotiations , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;7	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that may allow Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;8	That plan requires them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;9	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;10	Juppe said he hoped a meeting Friday with Christopher and the foreign ministers of Germany , Britain and Russia would launch `` a new initiative '' to end the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;11	Juppe added he will travel to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;12	However , in an apparent attempt to beef up its air power over Bosnia , NATO has asked Germany to add its warplanes to the allied forces on hand in case air strikes are called against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;13	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government was considering the request .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;14	The ministers endorsed a 12-month study to consider how to expand the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include East European democracies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;15	Issues will include financing , integrating the newcomers ' armies and nuclear issues , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;16	Anxious to ease Russian fears about the expansion , the foreign ministers emphasized the alliance was not trying to create a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;17	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in their final communique .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;18	The study will not name candidates for membership -- although Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners -- nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;19	Instead , the study will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0265;20	To counter Russian worries about NATO 's eastward expansion , the allies intend on Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Moscow and agree to hold regular talks on security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;0	They 're magazine cover boys , the hottest team -- and the hottest ticket -- around .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;1	They 're collecting nicknames , national attention and notoriety , just like the Pittsburgh Steelers of the '70s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;2	Suddenly , the Steelers are chic again , the team to beat in the American conference of the U.S. National Football League , the favorites to be the NFC 's 11th consecutive victim in the Super Bowl .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;3	Tired of living forever in the 1970s , they 're forging a new identity in the '90s and , even , catchy new nicknames .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;4	The `` Steel Curtain '' defense is retired , along with the four U.S. Pro Football Hall of Famers who made it special .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;5	Now , Pittsburgh is rallying around , and America is learning all about , a new , dominating , colorful , full-of-characters Steelers ' defense -- the Steel Trap .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;6	Jack Lambert is out , Greg Lloyd is in .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;7	Jack Ham finally can enjoy his retirement ; the Steelers have another sacking , attacking , havoc-wrecking linebacker , Kevin Greene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;8	The widely circulated weekly magazine Sports Illustrated is in on the secret , slapping Steelers defensive lineman Brentson Buckner across this week 's cover as he mauls a Los Angeles Raiders ' ballcarrier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;9	`` Wait until my dad goes to buy it and sees his son 's picture on the cover , '' Buckner said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;10	`` Is he going to be surprised . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;11	With four consecutive victories , seven in their last eight , the AFC 's best record and its best defense , the Steelers -LRB- 9-3 -RRB- are proving just as surprising .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;12	Driven and dominant again , they finally may be capable of returning to ... dare the words be said ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;13	As Pittsburgh resident Fred Rogers might say , `` Can you say Super Bowl ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;14	`` There 's a lot of similarities here to what we had going in San Francisco , '' said cornerback Tim McKyer , who played in two Super Bowls with the 49ers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;15	`` We 're a closeknit team , everybody gets along ... and we feel like we 're going to win in the fourth quarter . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;16	Or , as McKyer said when he signed with the Steelers last summer : `` I 'm here to win a championship . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;17	Apparently , so are the Steelers who walked around their locker room Wednesday with black-and-gold T-shirts proclaiming `` January 29 , 1995 '' on the front and `` We Believe '' on the back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;18	The significance of Jan. 29 , 1995 ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;19	Super Bowl XXIX will be played that day in Miami .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;20	`` But I do n't think these guys are worried about championships , '' Lloyd said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;21	`` We know what 's ahead of us ... and it wo n't come unless we take it game-to-game , week-to-week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0266;22	We all realize that if you play well , -LRB- championships -RRB- come . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;0	NATO on Thursday asked Germany to send fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia in a mission that would put the German military into its first hot war since World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;1	It will be a thorny decision for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his aides , who have shied from involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the history of Nazi atrocities in former Yugoslavia , and anti-German sentiment among many Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;2	It will also be a difficult request for Germany to turn down because of Kohl 's repeated assertions that his nation , seeking more international influence , must bear its share of peacekeeping responsibilities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;3	Lt. Col. Joe Cato , spokesman for NATO 's European military headquarters in Casteau , Belgium , said that the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe `` has requested -LRB- that -RRB- the German armed forces provide some combat aircraft to support NATO air operations over parts of former Yugoslavia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;4	NATO requested German Tornado planes equipped with electronic gear that can locate and identify radar sites , and rockets designed to destroy such sites , a German defense official said , speaking on background .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;5	The Tornado planes could help prevent Serb attacks on NATO planes patrolling Bosnia to enforce the U.N. humanitarian mission , and also could protect supply flights to Sarajevo , the official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;6	He and other officials could not confirm a report in the weekly Rheinische Merkur newspaper that the German planes would replace fighters that Britain planned to withdraw .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;7	A July decision of the German constitutional court enabled the government to engage in peacekeeping missions outside the NATO area for the first time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;8	German supply troops were involved in missions in Somalia and Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;9	`` Whether we , after the constitutional court ruling , should really choose former Yugoslavia as the place to step up our engagement , is something I believe we should consider very carefully , '' Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in Brussels , Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;10	Kohl has said Germany can not send peacekeepers to former Yugoslavia because of the bitter memories over the hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews and others murdered by the German army and SS officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;11	Earlier this week , Kohl described the Serb attacks and the NATO allies ' inability to stop them as a `` disgrace for civilized Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;12	Kohl added that he morally was in favor of lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the Muslim-led Bosnian government , but felt he had to support the embargo out of solidarity with European colleagues who have troops on the ground .
APW_ENG_19941201.0267;13	France , Britain and other governments oppose lifting the embargo because they fear it will expand the fighting and could bring Bosnian Serb reprisals against their soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0268;0	NATO foreign ministers on Thursday agreed to try to restart negotiations to end the war in Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941201.0271;0	Governments worldwide must improve crop production or face shortage of food in the future because of population explosion , water shortage and shrinking amounts of cultivable land , scientists said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;1	`` At the moment there is no shortfall but looking 20 years down the road we see a different picture , '' Randolph Barker , the new head of the International Irrigation Management Institute told scientists at the 10th anniversary of the organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;2	`` There is an alarming complacency that everything is all right on the food front .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;3	But we must learn to make more food with less land and water , and the research must start now because science takes time , '' said Roberto Lenton , the outgoing director-general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;4	`` The nightmare of world hunger that was stopped by the green revolution in agricultural production in the 1960s may return to haunt us , '' said M.S. Swaminathan , chairman of institute .

APW_ENG_19941201.0271;6	The amount of water available for irrigation is declining due to increased demands from growing population .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;7	At present , 80 percent of the water is for irrigation , but competition is increasing from household and industrial consumers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;8	The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research , the world body co-ordinating research on food production , is organizing a global initiative on increased water management to solve the problem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0271;9	The irrigation institute , headquartered in Colombo , has been designated the convening center .

APW_ENG_19941201.0272;2	Jamal Abdel Hamid Yussef , 23 , recounts operations of his unit of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades , the military wing of the Islamic group Hamas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;3	Yussef , who is wanted by both Israel and the PLO , describes the ambush of an Israeli jeep in which an officer was wounded and says his unit later kidnapped a soldier who was killed after being ordered to strip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;4	`` Our suicide operations are a message ... that our people love death .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;5	Our goal is to die for the sake of God , and if we live we want to humiliate Jews and trample on their necks , '' he says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;6	Yussef 's chilling confessions are part a videocassette which can be bought for dlrs 5 or rented for 30 cents in Gaza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;7	Similar ones are available in the West Bank and the Old City of Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;8	The videos , along with books and audio cassettes , are part of a well-orchestrated propaganda campaign which is funded in part by money raised in the United States , Arab oil states and Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;9	It is designed to win over Palestinians , especially young ones , who have lost hope in PLO leader Yasser Arafat 's ability to deliver change .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;10	The videotapes , usually poor quality , appear to be made locally and began appearing in the open only after the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho became autonomous in May .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;11	They intersperse songs , speeches of militant Islamic preachers , rallies , and TV footage of riots and the aftermath of suicide attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;12	Some like the tape starring Yussef 's underground group also provide instruction on how to use weapons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;13	After recounting the group 's attacks on Israelis , Yussef demonstrated how to assemble , load and fire the M-16 and AK-47 automatic rifles on the table in front of him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;14	The message in the videotapes is often far bloodier and direct than can be found in slogans painted on walls or even in underground leaflets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;15	The preachers promise a life of plenty in paradise -- where there are rivers of honey and 72 brides for any hero who is martyred fighting the enemies of Islam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;16	An attractive afterlife is a powerful recruiting message to jobless youths in refugee camps who see no future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;17	On one tape Sheikh Jamil Hamami , the leader of Hamas in Jerusalem , praises three Hamas activists who were killed during a siege of their hideout by Israeli soldiers in March , saying they restored pride to Palestinians who had been victimized by Israeli occupation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;18	`` There is a big , big difference between this group of martyrs who restored our dignity to us , restored our honor , and increased our confidence in God and our just cause , and the ones who want us to surrender and accept humiliation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;19	He condemns the Israel-PLO peacemaking that brought autonomy to the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank as a sellout of Palestinian dreams for statehood and independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;20	Israeli officials see such videotapes as a threat and selling or possessing them can lead to arrest and jail terms of two to five years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;21	Because people regard the words and speeches of recognized religious leaders as authoritative religious commandments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;22	In as much as people wish to be devout and obedient , they will strive to fulfill these demands , '' said Yigal Carmon , the government 's former terrorism adviser .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;23	Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has declared war on Hamas , arresting more than 400 Hamas activists and warning that the peace process has been imperiled by attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;24	Islamic militants are blamed for most of 94 people killed since September 1993 when the Israel-PLO accord was signed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;25	Two of those arrested earlier this month held American passports , although they have not been identified by name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0272;26	They were carrying large amounts of money and indoctrination material , including videotapes , according to Palestinian and Israeli sources .

APW_ENG_19941201.0273;0	President Clinton will name retiring Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to be a special adviser for economic initiatives in Ireland , White House officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;1	The appointment will be part-time , and not tied directly to peace talks between Britain and Ireland , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;2	British Ambassador Robin Renwick , after a visit to the White House Thursday , said Mitchell 's appointment will `` help with economic involvement and the future of Northern Ireland and to help support the peace process . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;3	Renwick lauded the appointment , saying the U.S. effort to bring investment and jobs to Northern Ireland `` is absolutely vital to the future of Northern Ireland . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;4	White House officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that Mitchell 's appointment does not mean the United States is getting directly involved in the peace process .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;5	They said he will try to improve the country 's economic condition , a development that would aid the peace effort .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;6	The appointment likely will not exclude Mitchell from other work after leaving office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;7	He has reportedly been considered for the post of U.S. baseball commissioner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;8	Mitchell , who has been involved in Irish issues for years , did not run for re-election .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;9	His efforts to pass President Clinton 's health care legislation this year failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;10	Mitchell will be a special adviser to the president and the secretary of state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;11	The Maine Democrat is ending a 12-year Senate career after the Senate votes Thursday on ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact .
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;12	Even if Mitchell had run for re
APW_ENG_19941201.0273;13	In addition to being majority leader , Mitchell has served on the Senate Finance Committee and its subcommittee on international trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;0	An elderly Briton who collapsed while being evacuated from the burning Achille Lauro was one of the two people killed on the cruise ship , officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;1	The Foreign Office identified the dead Briton as Arthur Morris , 68 , who -- like many of the 581 passengers -- lived in South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;2	A German passenger also died after fire broke out Wednesday in the cruise ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;3	One British newspaper report said Morris hit his head while trying to get to a lifeboat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;4	Other reports said he collapsed from stress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;5	One of the first British survivors to reach a rescue ship described how passengers , many still in evening dress , waited on the deck for hours as the fire billowed out of control , children sobbing and some passengers panicking .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;6	Tony Webb , 44 , who won the cruise as a competition prize , said his 2-year-old son Michael clung to him terrified as they looked back from a lifeboat `` at the Achille Lauro and the sight was amazing . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;7	`` The flames were leaping up and there was smoke all around , '' Webb , who now lives in Cape Town , said in an interview by radio with London 's Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;8	`` The fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down towards the cabins . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;9	Webb added , `` As we waited the smoke became thicker and thicker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;10	The crew were wonderful .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;11	They tried to keep us all calm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;12	At about 8 a.m. the captain said the fire was too strong and we would have to abandon the ship . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;13	Some 75 British passengers were taken on board a Greek cargo ship , Chios , on Thursday , the British news agency Press Association reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;14	Petankis Pringis , radio officer on the Chios , said most were in good spirits and would be telephoning relatives .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;15	`` Their relatives should not be worried .
APW_ENG_19941201.0274;16	They are better here than on the Achille Lauro , '' said Pringis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;0	When Irmgard Moeller went to prison 22 years ago for blowing up three American soldiers , the United States was fighting a war in Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;1	When she walked out Thursday , she heard the same anti-war songs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;2	Just about everything else was different .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;3	`` It still feels unreal , '' she said after stepping out the blue steel prison gate into the crisp air of this Baltic city , freed early from a life sentence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;4	About 200 supporters waved red flags , chanted revolutionary slogans and presented flowers as Germany 's longest-held female prisoner walked free , wearing jeans , a black leather jacket and a red sweater .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;5	`` I have to think first about what I 'll do in future , '' Moeller told reporters as she hugged friends and leftist activists , bearing Christmas presents and flowers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;6	The fall of communism has blunted the leftist cause , for which Moeller had remained a powerful symbol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;7	Gone is East Germany , where many terrorists on the run had found refuge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;8	United Germany is slowly assuming a more assertive role in world affairs , and its soldiers have served in peace missions abroad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;9	With NATO now asking for German fighter planes for the skies over Bosnia , the country 's military involvement abroad could again send leftists into the streets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;10	Moeller , her activities subject to approval by a probation officer for the next five years , promised to work for the release of other jailed terrorists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;11	`` The others must not stay in prison as long as I have , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;12	`` Free all political prisoners , '' the crowd chanted and carried banners with the same message .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;13	As she was driven away in her lawyer 's car , a loudspeaker mounted on a van blared out `` Internationale , '' the revolutionary socialist hymn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;14	Moeller 's release could lead to freedom for the seven other Red Army Faction serving long sentences .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;15	Unlike some other previously released former Red Army Faction members , Moeller did not renounce her terrorist past .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;16	But authorities could be hoping that her release will cement a truce with the leftist group that once had been seen as a possible threat to democracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;17	Three years ago , then President Richard von Weizsaecker said it was time to start a dialogue with former terrorists and to try to reintegrate them into society .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;18	After killing a German official in 1991 and blowing up a prison in 1993 , the Red Army Faction said it was ending its 20-year campaign of violence , during which it often targeted the American military and other symbols of what it called `` imperialism . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;19	Moeller was convicted of driving one of the explosives-laden cars that blew up in a parking lot at U.S. Army Headquarters in Heidelberg on May 24 , 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;20	The bomb killed Capt. Clyde R. Bonner and two enlisted men , Charles L. Peck and Ronald A. Woodward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;21	Moeller was arrested six weeks after the attack and sentenced to life in prison , plus 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;22	The Red Army Faction issued a statement after the bombing , calling it a protest against the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;23	Moeller was freed because of her poor health , although she has shown no remorse and refused to cooperate with psychiatric evaluations to determine if she was still dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;24	A court in the state of Schleswig-Holstein , where the prison is located , determined that she was not likely to commit another violent crime .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;25	The state prosecutor 's office agreed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;26	The U.S. State Department and relatives of the victims objected to her release , but many Germans feel 22 years was long enough for Moeller , regardless of the seriousness of her crimes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;27	Most prisoners sentenced to life in Germany are released after 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;28	There was no domestic protest , and newspaper articles about the case in the past weeks have focused on Moeller 's history and prison conditions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;29	`` While we recognize the independence of German courts , we are disappointed that an unrepentant terrorist who murdered three U.S. soldiers has been freed from prison , '' said a U.S. State Department statement issued in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;30	`` Prior to this parole , the United States formally reiterated to the government of Germany our view that convicted terrorists should serve their full prison terms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;31	In a 1992 interview with the magazine Der Spiegel , Moeller was asked if she felt sympathy for the victims of Red Army Faction violence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;32	` I ca n't deal with this so personally and individually , '' she replied .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;33	A striking , dark-haired woman when she went to jail , Moeller 's pale complexion , lined face and streaks of gay hair speak of the life behind bars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;34	She is suffering from skin , eye and other ailments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;35	Moeller lived through 12 hunger strikes and was the only survivor in the night of Oct. 18 , 1977 , when three other Red Army Faction leaders -- Andreas Baader , Jan-Carl Raspe and Gudrun Ensslin , committed suicide in the top-security Stammheim prison in Stuttgart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0275;36	Discovered with four stabs in her chest , Moeller has always claimed the terrorists were the victims of state violence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;0	The planned European Union-wide police force will not have its marching orders this year , as the dozen governments ended talks Thursday by failing to agree on rules for Europol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;1	Despite growing public concern about organized crime and international drug trafficking , justice and interior ministers here for a meeting again spent it squabbling over details on how to coordinate their police forces .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;2	The ministers have already missed an October deadline for adopting a convention for the Netherlands-based Europol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;3	Germany has sought an FBI-style agency , independent and with a long arm to track individuals or organizations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;4	But France wants national police forces to have easy access to Europol data , and would limit the exchange of information between member states .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;5	British officials are reluctant to feed sensitive information to a data bank that authorities in other member states can inspect any time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;6	Crime fighting remains the responsibility of individual governments , who have agreed to work together on the subject .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;7	Their lack of progress has caused frustration among EU officials , who remain powerless on the matter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;8	Commissioner Padraig Flynn , the EU 's justice and immigration chief , railed against the ministers Thursday , criticizing their slow pace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;9	`` We have made no progress '' on Europol , he told reporters after the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;10	`` There are some very obvious questions and they have to be faced up to . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;11	Flynn also complained that governments have not yet fixed immigration rules , and that `` nothing has happened '' with a plan to seal the union 's external frontiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0277;12	Both are necessary to allow free movement for people inside the trade bloc , a prime goal of the group 's border-free , single market that took effect Jan. 1 , 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;0	Riddick Bowe may have sold some extra tickets by punching Larry Donald at a prefight press conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;1	If he was trying to scare the mild-mannered former Olympian , Donald said it did n't work .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;2	`` When most big guys try to intimidate someone , they become intimidated , '' Donald said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;3	`` I think that 's what happened in this case . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;4	Donald skipped a final prefight press conference Wednesday , two days after being hit twice by Bowe at a similar gathering in Los Angeles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;5	`` It 's very hard to be in the room with a former world heavyweight champion when he pulls a stunt like that , '' Donald said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;6	Instead , Donald held his own press conference next door to the main event , where his manager , Steve Nelson , tried to get Bowe to apologize for Monday 's incident in Los Angeles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;7	`` The lack of class demonstrated by Riddick Bowe does not allow Larry to lower himself by appearing with him , '' Nelson said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;8	`` Riddick Bowe violated all rules of proper conduct as a boxer and a member of the human race . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;9	Bowe , who will fight Saturday for only the second time since losing his heavyweight titles last November to Evander Holyfield , was n't in an apologetic mood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;10	`` I 'm getting tired of being Mr. Nice Guy , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;11	`` People mistake my kindness for weakness .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;12	I told him not to say anything to me .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;13	He just kept running his lips . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;14	Although Bowe 's left-right combination in Los Angeles did n't land fully on Donald , it did cut the 1992 Olympian on the inside of his mouth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;15	It also left the mild-mannered fighter puzzled about his first foray into big-time boxing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;16	`` I 'm upset , '' Donald said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;17	`` Every time I turn around and I see the tape of it , it makes me upset . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;18	Donald , undefeated in 16 professional fights , said he and his handlers decided at the last minute to skip the press conference as a protest of Bowe 's actions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;19	Donald said the punches by Bowe came without warning as the two were talking about the fight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;20	`` I was shocked , '' said Donald , who did not fight back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;21	`` I always think before I react .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;22	I ca n't remember the last time I lost my temper . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;23	Marc Ratner , executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission , said no action would be taken by the commission since the incident occurred in California .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;24	Bowe is a 4-1 favorite to beat Donald in the scheduled 12-round fight Saturday at Caesars Palace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;25	Bowe , 34-1 , has fought only once since losing to Holyfield , getting a no-decision after hitting Buster Mathis Jr. while he was down in their August fight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0278;26	Donald , who lost in the quarterfinals of the Barcelona Olympics , is 16-0 with 12 knockouts and is ranked No. 5 by the WBC .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;0	Despite its public ban on war aid to Bosnian Serbs , Yugoslavia has assisted in a crucial attack on northwest Bosnia , according to Bosnian , Serb , and U.N. reports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;1	The reports released this week raise doubts about Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 's commitment to the aid cutoff he announced in August to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;2	The attack on Bihac in northwest Bosnia called NATO 's bluff to use large-scale force against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;3	It has led to a rapid deterioration in the United Nations ' authority , and on Wednesday , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the 24,000 peacekeepers might have to be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;4	In October , the Bosnian army 's 5th Corps broke out of the Bihac area where government forces are completely surrounded by Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;5	They pushed the Serbs back in a surprise attack to the east and south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;6	But the Serbs counter-attacked furiously , and now control 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared Bihac `` safe area , '' which encompasses the town of Bihac and environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;7	Fighting there is continuing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;8	Classified U.N. reports , claims by the Bosnian government , and reports by media and reliable sources in Yugoslavia all suggest that fighters and supplies from Yugoslavia have been involved in the Bihac combat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;9	`` It is so obvious that ... Serbs received new weapons , fresh troops ... and fuel to move ` dry ' tanks , '' charged Gen. Jovan Divjak , a Serb who serves as deputy commander of the Bosnian army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;10	`` Otherwise , they would n't have been able to put Bihac under such strong pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;11	Bosnian government officials said intelligence reports indicated fuel and ammunition trucks had crossed the border into Bosnia from Serbia , the main republic in Yugoslavia , and that armor , helicopters and rockets all had been provided .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;12	In a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday , Charles Thomas , the U.S. representative on a five-nation group seeking peace in Bosnia , told reporters that Milosevic 's clampdown was generally successful , but that the border was `` somewhat porous . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;13	Several hundred international monitors are assigned to check the roughly 500-kilometer -LRB- 300-mile -RRB- Yugoslav-Bosnian border for violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;14	Their reports so far have revealed no violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;15	But reports from Yugoslavia and from U.N. observers indicate that Milosevic may have used the involvement of Serbs from Croatia to get assistance to the Bihac combatants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;16	While Milosevic said he was cutting off help to the Bosnian Serbs , he did not make a similar pledge regarding the Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;17	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had noticed armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;18	The presence of fighters from Yugoslavia in Bosnia also was reported in Milosevic 's Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;19	The Svet weekly , based in the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad , said a special Serbian police unit of up to 1,000 men headed by a top police officer had joined the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;20	The weekly said the policemen crossed into Bosnia as civilians , and traveled through Bosnia to Croatia , where they received weapons and uniforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;21	A senior Serbian police official denied the Svet report .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;22	But reliable sources in Belgrade confirmed that Yugoslav army and police detachments actively took part in the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0280;23	Svet also claimed that the only other republic in Yugoslavia , Montenegro , had shipped a large supply of fuel to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;0	Under a furious lobbying barrage from the Clinton administration and a small army of corporate executives , the Senate stood on the verge Thursday of ratifying a sweeping expansion of global free trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;1	The climatic vote will not occur until the end of a second full day of debate , but supporters were claiming they now had an ample number of votes for the agreement itself and , more importantly , a small cushion for the three-fifths majority they need on a budget waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;2	`` By the time the vote is actually taken tonight , we expect GATT will pass , '' said presidential press secretary Dee Dee Myers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;3	While administration officials and Senate supporters said their vote counts showed victory in their grasp , they did not let up in their lobbying efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;4	President Clinton met at the White House with a group of mostly undecided senators in an attempt to build the victory margin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;5	Sen. Kent Conrad said the president told senators `` they will regret the vote the rest of their lives '' if they oppose GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;6	Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned the accord 's defeat would have an `` adverse reaction '' in both the stock and bond markets , Conrad said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;7	Opponents , while conceding that the momentum was not going their way , did not let up in their efforts , either .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;8	A group of two-dozen protesters , one dressed as a lame-duck , chanted outside the White House as senators arrived for breakfast with Clinton .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;9	Sen. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina said that the new trade agreement was a bad deal that , by lowering trade barriers , would subject American workers to even more unfair competition from low-wage countries , further weakening the country 's economic standing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;10	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;11	Everybody knows that , '' said Hollings , whose home-state textile industry will be one of the biggest losers in the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;12	`` Wake up , Washington . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;13	However , GATT supporters said that the Senate 's choice on the last day of the 103rd Congress was between continuing to hold a position of economic leadership in the global economy or retreating behind protectionist barriers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;14	The House endorsed the accord , negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , by a 288-146 vote on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;15	Thirty-three other countries already have ratified the 124-nation accord and supporters said other countries are poised to act before Jan. 1 if the Senate follows the House .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;16	According to an Associated Press survey , GATT proponents appeared on the verge of victory , when counting those who were leaning in favor but not firmly committed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;17	The AP head count had 60 senators for or leaning for waiving budget rules , 26 against or leaning against and 14 undeclared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;18	Opponents ' only hope was to change enough senators ' minds to muster 41 votes in favor of the procedural hurdle imposed by Sen. Robert Byrd .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;19	Under Senate rules , the implementing bill must offset all of the projected dlrs 43 billion in lost tariff revenues over the first decade of the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;20	To make up for the lost tariffs , the administration is cutting farm subsidies and raising revenue with a number of measures , including changing the minimum rate on savings bonds and auctioning licenses for a new generation of wireless broadcast services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;21	Byrd said the bill falls dlrs 14.5 billion short and some senators , while declaring themselves in favor of free trade , said they would not vote to bust the budget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;22	Byrd and others also complain that a new Geneva-based World Trade Organization , created to referee trade disputes , will inevitably infringe on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;23	The administration is predicting 500,000 new American jobs as a result of increased U.S. export sales under GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0281;24	In addition to bringing foreign tariffs closer to U.S. levels , it reduces barriers to trade in agricultural goods and services and protects U.S. intellectual property , such as computer programs , from being pirated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;0	Chrysler Corp. increased its dividend 60 percent Thursday , announced it would buy back dlrs 1 billion in stock and relaxed its anti-takeover defenses , three of four steps proposed by the company 's largest shareholder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;1	Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian , who owns 9 percent of Chrysler , also had asked the company to split its stock , but no split was announced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;2	The quarterly dividend was increased to 40 cents a share from 25 cents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;3	The company had announced 5-cent increases twice in the past year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;4	The stock repurchase program will start after the first of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;5	`` We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value , and this is a very effective method for doing so , '' Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said in the announcement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;6	The company 's `` poison pill '' anti-takeover provision was modified so that it is not triggered until a stockholder acquires 15 percent of the outstanding shares .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;7	The previous trigger was 10 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;8	Kerkorian has asked federal regulators ' permission to increase his stake in the company to up to 15 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;9	Eaton said the `` poison pill ' change was prompted by Kerkorian 's actions , but that the other measures had been under consideration for some time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0282;10	The company also announced it was increasing its five-year capital spending program to dlrs 22.9 billion from the current level of dlrs 20.8 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0284;0	Nigeria 's budget for 1995 will be based on crude oil sales estimated at dlrs 16 a barrel , the government-owned Daily Times newspaper reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0284;1	Oil provides 80 percent of government earnings and more than 90 percent of foreign exchange revenue for the West African nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0284;2	This year 's budget of dlrs 4.87 billion was based on a crude oil price of dlrs 14 a barrel , though actual sales averaged dlrs 17 a barrel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0284;3	The government has yet has to publish the report of a commission that found that dlrs 12.2 billion made from extra oil sales during the Gulf War has not been accounted for .
APW_ENG_19941201.0284;4	Nigeria produces 1.9 million barrels of oil daily , and exports 1.5 million of that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;0	A Pennsylvania company has found evidence of soil and groundwater contamination at U.S. Navy base on this British colony scheduled to close next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;1	Curtis Kimbel , environmental director of Naval Air Station Bermuda , said petroleum products apparently leaked from some of the base 's 130 underground storage tanks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;2	The tanks stored jet fuel , diesel fuel and heating oil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;3	The 1,200-acre base , which opened during World War II , is scheduled to close next Sept. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;4	RT Environmental Services Inc. of King of Prussia , Pa. has been drilling and performing other tests for the last two months under a $ 480,000 contract with the Bermuda government , which will inherit the base property .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;5	A report from RT is expected in two weeks and the government has n't commented on the findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;6	But Kimbel and other Navy officials said RT has shared information with them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;7	`` Their preliminary results have shown some soil contamination and some potential groundwater contamination , '' said Cmdr. Mike Donnelly , the Navy 's public works officer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;8	Donnelly said the Navy will study RT 's report before deciding how much cleanup is required .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;9	The Navy 's policy is to eliminate known risks to health and safety .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;10	Under an agreement with Great Britain , the Americans have occupied the land rent-free , also running Bermuda 's commercial airport on the base free of charge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;11	The Navy has placed a $ 140 million price tag on improvements it has made to the Naval Air Station and another smaller base on the island .
APW_ENG_19941201.0285;12	But Bermuda argues that the money spent will be more than offset by the cost of environmental damage and of demolishing or maintaining base buildings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;0	Liverpool fans , take heart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;1	Ian Rush has rediscovered his scoring touch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;2	After a drought of seven games without a goal , the Welshman scored three times in Liverpool 's 3-1 victory over Premier League leaders Blackburn in the League Cup on Wednesday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;3	Rush 's hat trick came in his 600th appearance for Liverpool and brought his career total with the club to 329 goals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;4	Of those , 46 have come in the League Cup , just three short of Geoff Hurst 's all-time record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;5	Blackburn striker Mike Newell led the accolades for the 33-year-old Rush .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;6	`` I 've watched Rushie as a Liverpool fan and he 's just a born scorer , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;7	`` What he did out there was a lesson in finishing for all of us .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;8	He 's showed again that you can never write him off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;9	He 's proved over the last 10 years that he 's the No. 1 striker in the country . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;10	Blackburn manager Kenny Daglish paid tribute to his former teammate at Anfield .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;11	`` A lot of people have been saying he 's a bad player this season , but this will bring them to their senses , '' Daglish said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;12	`` His record speaks for itself and always will . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;13	Rush said he was just happy to have ended his scoring slump .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;14	`` When you 're not scoring you 've got to battle your way through it , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;15	`` Even though I 've not scored for a while , I 've had two or three disallowed when I did n't think I was offside but you 've got to accept that you will go through those spells . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;16	Rush hopes he can replicate his League Cup heroics when Liverpool plays at Coventry on Saturday in the Premier League .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;17	Liverpool lies in fourth place with 30 points from 16 games , six points behind Blackburn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;18	The Reds are counting on a victory after collecting just one point from a possible six .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;19	Another team coming off a big League Cup win is Arsenal , which downed Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 and plays at Nottingham Forest on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;20	It was a morale-boosting win for the Gunners , reeling from Paul Merson 's admission that he was addicted to cocaine and news that the FA was looking into alleged financial irregularities at the club involving the signing of foreign players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;21	But Arsenal 's victory came at a high price as several players went down to injury and are doubtful for Saturday 's game : goalkeeper David Seaman -LRB- cracked rib -RRB- , Steve Morrow -LRB- back -RRB- , Alan Smith and Paul Dickov -LRB- ankle -RRB- and Eddie McGoldrick -LRB- hamstring -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;22	On top of that , Tony Adams is scheduled for achilles tendon surgery .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;23	Nottingham Forest , in fifth place with 28 points , needs a win over Arsenal to keep in title contention .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;24	Blackburn will be looking to bounce back after the League Cup exit to Liverpool .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;25	But the Rovers face a stern test at Wimbledon -- the side that dented their championship hopes last season with a 4-1 triumph .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;26	The ` Dons , who went on to beat eventual champions Manchester United , have shown signs in recent weeks that they are returning to form .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;27	Injury-hit Newcastle , which last weekend slipped out of the top two for the first time this season , plays at Tottenham .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;28	Kevin Keegan 's club played without eight first-team regulars in Wednesday 's League Cup draw at Manchester City and the reserves are likely to be needed again at White Hart Lane .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;29	Manchester United , one point adrift of Blackburn , plays at home against a Norwich side that has scored just four goals in eight away matches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;30	United has won nine straight at Old Trafford and has yet to concede a goal at home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;31	Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar 's perfect record since being accused of match-fixing will be put to the test when Southampton plays host to Chelsea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;32	Brian Little returns to Leicester as manager of Aston Villa in a relegation battle between two clubs separated by just two points at the bottom of the standings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;33	In other games , Ipswich hosts Manchester City while Sheffield Wednesday is home against Crystal Palace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;34	On Sunday , it 's Queens Park Rangers vs. West Ham .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;35	In Division One , Middlesbrough should maintain its lead with a home win against Portsmouth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;36	Wolverhampton , two points off the lead , plays Sunday at Millwall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0286;37	In the Scottish Premier Division , second-place Motherwell plays at Celtic , while leaders Rangers travel to Dundee on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;0	NATO foreign ministers approved an American proposal today to study expanding the alliance to include central and east European countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;1	Anxious to ease Russian fears about the expansion of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the foreign ministers emphasized the alliance was not trying to create a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;2	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a draft of their final statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;3	The plan to move toward expanding NATO was planned as the centerpiece of two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;4	But the unprecedented strains between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia overshadowed the talks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;5	In an effort to heal the divisions , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;6	That marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;7	With the policy turnaround , ministers agreed to relaunch diplomatic efforts to end the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;8	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters he hoped a meeting Friday with Christopher and the foreign ministers of Germany , Britain and Russia would launch `` a new initiative '' to end the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;9	Juppe added he will travel to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;10	Christopher has also said he may go .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;11	At the same time , in an apparent attempt to beef up its air power over Bosnia , NATO has asked Germany to add its warplanes to the allied forces in case airstrikes are called against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;12	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government was considering the request .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;13	The request is highly sensitive because of Germany 's postwar pacifist tradition , and the history of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans during World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;14	The foreign ministers were anxious their talks not be entirely hijacked by the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;15	They ordered a study that would set out the terms for the acceptance of east European countries as new members .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;16	It should be ready when the ministers meet in Brussels a year from now .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;17	The United States had initially proposed a six-month study of enlargement , but the Europeans , mindful of Russia 's fears of isolation , extended it to 12 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;18	The study will not name candidates for membership -- although Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners -- nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;19	Instead , the study will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states , how much enlargement will cost and how to integrate the newcomer 's army into NATO 's command structure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0287;20	To counter Russian worries about NATO 's eastward expansion , the allies intend later today to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Moscow and agree to hold regular talks on security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;0	Princess Diana comforted a 4-year-old girl dying of AIDS on Thursday and joked with a man who has had the disease for 11 years , continuing a commitment to raise AIDS-awareness .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;1	The princess , resuming more public engagements two years after her separation from Prince Charles , visited the new Mortimer Market Clinic in London on World AIDS day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;2	Chatting with one patient , Chris Keegan , who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1983 , she teased him that his tie and shirt not matching .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;3	`` You obviously have n't seen my socks , '' replied Keegan , and proceeded to show her them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;4	`` She has a remarkable talent ... of being able to engage people , talk to them and comfort them , '' said National Aids Trust chairman Mike Adler , who accompanied Diana on her tour of the clinic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;5	Diana made headlines in 1987 when she opened London 's first Aids ward , and was photographed shaking hands with patients .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;6	The publicity helped decrease the pariah status of AIDS-afflicted patients in Britain .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;7	The new clinic , the Mortimer Market Center , is expected to become Europe 's largest clinic for the treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases , administering to 80,00 patients a year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0288;8	Diana was attending a rock concert to raise funds for AIDS research at London 's Wembley arena on Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;0	Upstart vs. traditional power , explosive offense vs. stingy defense , Batistuta vs. Baggio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;1	Well , two out of three is n't bad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;2	When surprising Fiorentina travels to Juventus of Turin for the 12th round 's best matchup on Sunday , the hosts likely will be without injured star striker Roberto Baggio , the 1993 FIFA player of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;3	He took a kick to the knee in last Sunday 's 2-1 victory over Padova , keeping him out of Juve 's Italian Cup quarterfinal match with AS Roma on Thursday and making him doubtful for the encounter with Fiorentina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;4	After an injury-hampered start to the season , Baggio had begun to show flashes of his usual brilliance , with two goals in a UEFA match last week and a goal against Padova .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;5	Twenty-year-old sensation Alessandro Del Piero starts in his place .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;6	The Florence squad probably wo n't mind Baggio 's absence , and will have on display its own talented forward : Argentine Gabriel Batistuta , who leads the league with 13 goals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;7	He 'll look to extend his record-setting scoring streak to 12 games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;8	For fans , it would be a great encounter with the two bombers on the field at once .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;9	But the game is still intriguing without Baggio .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;10	It pits two of the top three teams in the league .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;11	Juventus is 7-2-1 with a game in hand and out of first place only on goal differential ; Fiorentina is one standings point behind with a 6-4-1 record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;12	While the clubs are producing similar results this season , their stories are quite different .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;13	Juventus is the most decorated club in Italian history , with 22 league championships to its credit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;14	The team has finished lower than fourth place only three times in the last 25 seasons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;15	Fiorentina , conversely , has not finished higher than fourth in the past 10 years and was relegated to Serie B for last season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;16	Juve has a veteran-laden roster , including several members of the squad that captured the 1992 UEFA Cup .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;17	It plays a very controlled game , attacking precisely and rarely opening its backfield to rushes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;18	Juve has allowed just six goals in its 10 games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;19	Fiorentina is very young , with Batistuta , 25 , leading by example .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;20	Five regulars are 24 or younger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;21	The squad plays an exciting , open game , scoring by the bushel but also careless on defense at times .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;22	While its league-leading offense has 26 goals , the defense has allowed 15 , more than all but the last five teams in the standings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;23	Fiorentina will not be at full strength , however , with midfielders Sandro Cois and Fabrizio Di Mauro having suffered injuries in last round 's 2-2 draw with Sampdoria of Genoa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;24	The squad those two trail in the standings , AC Parma , gets an apparent breather on Sunday against winless Brescia , which is 17th in the 18-team league .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;25	Parma looked impressive in defeating Fiorentina 2-0 in a first-leg quarterfinal match of the Italian Cup on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;26	The goals came from forward Marco Branca and Italian international Gianfranco Zola , the squad 's offensive leaders all year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;27	Fifth-place AS Roma looks to follow up its rousing 3-0 derby win over Lazio of Rome by picking on visiting Padova and its league-worst defense .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;28	U.S. defender Alexi Lalas and mates have allowed 26 goals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;29	Argentine Abel Balbo -LRB- eight goals -RRB- and Uruguayan Daniel Fonseca -LRB- four -RRB- should find plenty of room to operate and keep Roma on the leaders ' heels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;30	Lazio , in fourth , hopes to rebound at Cagliari .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;31	This week features the Genoa derby , pitting two struggling squads .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;32	Sampdoria is in ninth place , having been unable to put together two good halves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;33	Genoa stands on the cusp of the relegation zone and lost 1-0 to lowly Cremonese last Sunday in the debut of coach Pippo Marchioro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;34	Other games Sunday : Bari hosts Foggia in a regional derby ; Cremonese plays Internazionale of Milan ; and Torino is at Napoli .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;35	AC Milan 's match against Reggiana has been postponed until Jan. 11 because the three-time champions played the Intercontinental Cup final Thursday in Tokyo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0289;36	Milan lost 2-0 to Argentina 's Velez Sarsfield .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;0	Clashes among rival political groups left at least four persons dead and 20 injured Thursday in two states elections considered tests of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's popularity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;1	The clashes occurred mostly in Andhra Pradesh , the home state of Rao , where leftist guerrillas called for a boycott of the elections in their northern stronghold to protest successive corrupt governments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;2	In the neighboring state of Karnataka , one political activist was killed when a mob hurled rocks at him while he tried to mobilize voters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;3	The election was considered to be peaceful by Indian standards , where dozens of people have in the past been killed on the day of the balloting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;4	More than half of the 38 million voters cast their ballots across the two states Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;5	In Andhra Pradesh , police said they also killed three militants of the Peoples War Group , a rebel group fighting for poor farmers that carried out a series of sabotage incidents in the final weeks of the campaign to disrupt the voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;6	Two of the deaths in the state were blamed on explosives hurled during clashes political rivals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;7	The third death occurred when a truck carrying crude bombs and activists of the Telugu Desam Party overturned while being chased by police .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;8	Four of the 38 bombs exploded and killed one person and injured another , police said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;9	Police received many cases of villagers looting ballot boxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;10	Voting for state legislatures in the two south Indian states was seen as an important bellwether for Congress , which already has suffered setbacks in the north and must retain its support in the south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;11	A loss in Rao 's own state could unleash rivalries in the governing party that he suppressed with difficulty last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;12	Results will be announced Dec. 9 for elections in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and two other states that voted last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0291;13	The voting is staggered to allow police forces to move from one to another to protect polling stations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;0	Pro-Iranian guerrillas in Lebanon once fired Israeli-made shells at northern Israel , Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;1	The lesson , he told his ruling Labor party 's central committee , was `` be careful about who you sell weapons to . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;2	He stressed the extremist Islamic movements financed by Iran were Israel 's worst enemies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;3	`` For the sake of employment , we , the state of Israel , once sold weapons to Iran , '' Rabin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;4	He did not specify when the sales took place .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;5	Israel was accused during the Iran-Contra scandal of selling weapons to Teheran as part of an arms-for-hostages deal and during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;6	Hezbollah , the militia fighting Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon since 1984 , has since fired Israeli-made 120mm shells at Israel , and four struck near the towns of Margaliot and Manara , Rabin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;7	He did not say when the shells were fired or whether they caused any casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;8	It was the first time Rabin admitted Israel sold arms to enemy nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;9	But weapons experts have previously suggested the possibility , given Israel 's financially troubled arms industries and some illegal deals uncovered in the past .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;10	`` The most important thing is n't the existence of the defense industries but who we sell to , '' Rabin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0292;11	State-owned defense firms , once a symbol of Israeli self-sufficiency and industrial prowess , are losing about dlrs 1 billion annually because of declining orders worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;0	A law enforcer called it `` white-collar crime at its worst . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;1	A Bulgarian diplomat , two lawyers , a policeman , a stockbroker , a firefighter and two rabbis were among those accused of laundering more than $ 100 million in drug proceeds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;2	The organization operated in Puerto Rico , New York , Los Angeles , Houston , Chicago and Miami as well as in Germany , Switzerland , Italy and Colombia , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;3	Carlo A. Boccia of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the defendants had a common motivation -- `` greed , a true example of how drug profits do corrupt at all levels of society . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;4	Boccia , special agent in charge of the New York office , said Wednesday that the defendants were part of a money laundering cell that enabled tens of millions of dollars to flow between major U.S. cities and Germany , Switzerland and Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;5	Boccia joined U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White , New York FBI head William A. Gavin and Police Commissioner William Bratton in condemning the alleged participation of otherwise respected professionals in the drug trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;6	`` Money became the narcotic , '' Gavin said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0293;8	`` It is white-collar crime at its worst , '' White said , likening the defendants ' alleged deeds to those of street dealers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;9	`` The range of professions involved in this was surprising and somewhat depressing , '' said White , noting that a lawyer who was arrested practiced often at the federal courthouse in Manhattan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;10	A federal complaint charged 23 defendants with participating in a major international ring that laundered tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;11	Among the group was an assistant manager at Citibank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;12	During the probe , investigators seized $ 5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;13	They arrested all but four of those named in a complaint , which was sealed until Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;14	Some were arrested at their offices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;15	According to court documents , the leaders of the organization in the United States were Richard Spence , a businessman who was formerly a New York City firefighter ; lawyer Harvey Weinig ; and Robert Hirsch , Weinig 's law partner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;16	Hirsch , 41 , has pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges in a plea bargain with prosecutors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;17	White charged that the three arranged for the pickup of narcotics proceeds from street corners and hotel rooms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;18	Among those allegedly sent as couriers were police Officer Michael T. Kalanz , firefighter Charles Bruno , hospital administrator Gary Salerno , Los Angeles-based stockbroker Donald J. Hayden and rabbis Alexander Schwartz and Menashe Leifer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;19	Also arrested was Latchezar Christov , an honorary consul general for the Republic of Bulgaria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0293;20	Those arrested were charged with conspiracy and money laundering .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;0	The condition of Prince Bernhard , father of Dutch Queen Beatrix , continued to improve Thursday after weekend cancer surgery , a Royal House spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;1	`` His stomach function is recovering .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;2	The medical team thinks that 's a very important improvement , '' said the spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;3	The 83-year-old German-born prince underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation Saturday to remove a cancerous tumor from his large intestine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;4	Bernhard , husband of ex-Queen Juliana , is still suffering from pneumonia which he contracted following the operation at the Academic Hospital in the central Dutch city of Utrecht .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;5	`` The pneumonia is developing as doctors thought it would .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;6	It 's slow but he is not young any more , '' the spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0294;7	The debonair prince , renowned for his vigor and active interests despite his age , is one of the nation 's most visible and popular public figures .
APW_ENG_19941201.0295;0	President Clinton putting dlrs 25 billion into military readiness , Pentagon officials say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;0	Ernesto Zedillo becomes president Thursday , promising profound political and legal reforms to match the market-opening that resulted in a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;1	The 42-year-old U.S.-trained economist caps an unlikely journey when he assumes the red , green and white presidential sash to start a six-year term as leader of this country of 90 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;2	Hundreds of soldiers lined the parade route Zedillo will take after his inauguration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;3	Shops were closed and major boulevards nearly deserted for the national holiday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;4	Police blocked off entrances to the Chamber of Deputies where dozens of world leaders , including U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Cuba 's Fidel Castro would witness the transition to the 63rd presidency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;5	Argentine President Carlos Menem was the last to arrive , flying into Mexico City around dawn to join the more than 1,500 guests who will watch the oath-taking in the legislature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;6	Zedillo , a former Mexicali shoeshine boy achieved a Yale doctorate in economics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;7	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , he was thrust into the campaign by the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , first choice of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;8	He won the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;9	Zedillo has pledged to use the near-absolute powers of Mexico 's presidency to weaken his own office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;10	He says he will give greater independence to the congress , the courts and local governments as well as the PRI itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;11	He says he will end the practice of having the president select all top PRI candidates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;12	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , is sure to continue his predecessor 's free-market economic policies -- a commitment underlined by the Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;13	Leading negotiators of the North American Free Trade Agreement were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;14	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;15	Zedillo also showed signs of a political opening with the appointment of a conservative opposition party member , Antonio Lozano , as attorney general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;16	The post is crucial for Zedillo , who made fighting government corruption a major part of his campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;17	His Cabinet includes three women -- the most ever appointed at the outset of a Mexican administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;18	They are Norma Samaniego as controller ; Silvia Hernandez for tourism ; and biologist Julia Carabias for fisheries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;19	On Tuesday , Zedillo reached out to the left as well , meeting with leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party and promising reforms to help make Mexico more democratic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;20	Salinas never met publicly with leaders of that main leftist opposition during his administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;21	The party apparently responded by pulling some 4,000 protesters out of the capital 's main plaza Wednesday , indicating an effort to avoid the confrontations that marred Salinas ' inauguration in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;22	The demonstrators were protesting alleged vote fraud in recent state elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;23	A protest was planned Thursday by leftist supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels of southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;24	That rebellion , stalled since January by a cease-fire , is one of the toughest problems facing the new president .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;25	Last week , a deputy attorney general investigating the Sept. 28 assassination of his own brother , a top PRI official , resigned angrily , charging that top government and party officials were involved in a cover-up .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;26	Lozano 's appointment marks the first time a Cabinet post has been given to an opposition party member , and it `` opens the possibility of an important change , '' said Carlos Castillo Pedraza , the president of the National Action Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;27	On Tuesday , Zedillo reached out to the left as well , meeting with leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party and promising reforms to help make Mexico more democratic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;28	Salinas never met publicly with leaders of that main leftist opposition during his administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;29	The party apparently responded by pulling some 4,000 protesters out of the capital 's main plaza Wednesday , indicating an effort to avoid the confrontations that marred Salinas ' inauguration in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;30	The demonstrators were protesting alleged vote fraud in recent state elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;31	Despite Zedillo 's moves , other discontent remains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;32	A protest was planned Thursday by leftist supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels of southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0296;33	That rebellion , stalled since January by a cease-fire , is one of the toughest problems facing the new president .
APW_ENG_19941201.0297;0	President Clinton is prepared to put an additional dlrs 25 billion into the military budget to help improve the readiness of forces and the quality of life for the troops , Pentagon officials said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0297;1	Clinton was slated to make the announcement at the White House later in the day , the officials said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0297;2	The money would help cover a dlrs 40 billion shortfall over five years that had been created by a congressionally required pay raise , and by inflation , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0297;3	`` It focuses , however , on the issue of readiness -- making sure the force is able to conduct and win the nation 's wars , '' one of the senior officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0298;0	The move is also expected to help Clinton quell Republican charges that the administration has , through its budget cuts , hurt the nation 's defense posture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0298;1	The new funds are expected to cover several initiatives that would also improve such things as housing and other quality-of-life programs , building on an recent announcement by Defense Secretary William Perry that more money would be put into such things , a second official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0298;2	Perry and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. John Shalikashvili , were to be present for the announcement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0298;3	`` This means that there will be more flying hours for pilots , more steaming hours for ships , '' which helps the force remain ready to conduct combat operations at a moment 's notice , the second official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;0	Scottish driver David Coulthard , one of the hottest new stars of Formula One racing , has left the Williams Formula One team to sign with rival McLaren , according to British news reports Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;1	Williams , however , could still try to block the move , The Times reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;2	Coulthard , 23 , emerged as a rising star after he was promoted from test driver following the death of Ayrton Senna .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;3	He was paired with Damon Hill for the rest of the season until Nigel Mansell returned from the Indy car series to race in the final three races .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;4	Coulthard 's best performance was a second-place finish behind Hill in the Portuguese Grand Prix .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;5	The Williams team has been debating whether to sign Coulthard or Mansell for next season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;6	The Times reported that Coulthard , 23 , signed for McLaren before the Australian Grand Prix last month and is set to be paired next season with Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;7	McLaren issued a statement Thursday saying , `` David Coulthard is one of the drivers McLaren has been looking at .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;8	This means that there are ongoing negotiations , but until these have been resolved , McLaren considers it not proper to comment . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;9	According to The Times , Williams could seek to have Coulthard 's contract with McLaren ruled invalid at a meeting of the Formula One Contract Recognition Board in Geneva , Switzerland , on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0299;10	Williams argues that the deal was signed while Coulthard was still under option to Williams , The Times said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;0	Bebeto is laid up with a bad cold and Romario 's hair is falling out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;1	As Deportivo de La Coruna and Barcelona prepare for a titans ' battle Saturday , their respective Brazilian aces are ailing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;2	The match is vital for both teams .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;3	Deportivo , 7-4-1 and 18 points , is just behind league-leading Real Madrid -LRB- 8-2-2 -RRB- on goal difference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;4	Barcelona -LRB- 7-2-3 -RRB- is two points back in fourth place and still smarting from its first defeat at home in 10 months against Sevilla last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;5	That result followed the humiliating defeat by Turkey 's Galatasaray in European Champions League play which left Barcelona 's path to the cup 's quarterfinals in danger .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;6	Both Deportivo and Barcelona place much stock in their respective Brazilian World Cup aces , Bebeto and Romario .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;7	But on Saturday , at least , Deportivo will be without its top striker , who on Wednesday was ordered to stay indoors for at least two weeks while antibiotics work on a chest cold .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;8	The news was welcomed by Barcelona goalkeeper Carlos Busquets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;9	`` Bebeto is a magnificent player and it 's one less problem for us , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;10	Meanwhile , Barcelona 's star Romario is likely to be physically fit for the game , but he told a Brazilian daily this week that life at the top is wasting him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;11	`` It 's now that I 'm feeling the pressure of the responsibility I took on in the U.S. -LRB- World Cup -RRB- , '' Romario told the Jornal do Brasil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;12	`` I promised to win a fourth world title for Brazil and that brought a lot of pressure on me .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;13	I 'm stressed out . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;14	`` The worst part is that there 's nothing I can do ... my hair is falling out non-stop , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;15	Romario , the league 's top scorer last season with 30 goals , has scored only three in 12 rounds so far this fall , nine fewer than at the same point last season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;16	But under stress or not , Romario like his other teammates still had to endure a training session Wednesday reported to have been the longest and most excruciating since coach Johan Cruyff took over Barcelona .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;17	Cruyff undoubtedly is aware that although the season is only about a third finished , a defeat Saturday could allow Real Madrid and Deportivo to put some distance between themselves and Barcelona and seriously hurt its chances of winning a fifth straight title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;18	Also on Saturday , Madrid travels north to play Real Sociedad , which is struggling in 17th , three places from the cellar , and still recovering from the sacking of long-time coach Welshman John Toshack last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;19	While all of Madrid 's three losses this season have been on the road , Sociedad has managed to win only one of six home games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;20	One club hoping Madrid , Deportivo and Barcelona all trip up is Zaragoza , which is in third-place a point behind the leaders going into its match Sunday against Sporting de Gijon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;21	Saturday also sees two other first-division games : Athletic de Bilbao traveling to Atletico de Madrid ; and Valencia hosting Albacete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0300;22	The rest of the 13th round will be played Sunday with Betis at Oviedo , Valladolid at home to Celta ; Logrones at Tenerife , Racing going to Compostela , and Sevilla hosting Espanol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0304;0	Both officials said it was unclear to them exactly where the administration hoped to obtain the additional funds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0304;1	They said the announcement will not include decisions about potential weapons program cuts that were being pondered by Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch , and that had been expected to be revealed this month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0304;2	Deutch had been looking at the potential for canceling , stretching out or cutting back ten major weapons programs , including such things as the Air Force 's F-22 fighter jet , the Army 's Comanche helicopter , the TSSAM Tri-service Standoff Attack Missile and the Marine 's AAAV Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0304;3	This year , the administration 's Pentagon 's fiscal 1995 budget amounted to dlrs 264 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;0	Stefan Edberg will lead off Sweden 's campaign to win its fifth Davis Cup title when he faces Alexander Volkov in Friday 's opening match of the final against Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;1	Edberg , ranked No. 7 in the world , is appearing in his seventh final in 11 years , but it will be the first final for Volkov and teammate Yevgeny Kafelnikov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;2	The 27-year-old Volkov , who won last month 's Kremlin Cup tournament in Moscow , could have trouble with the seasoned Edberg at Moscow 's Olympic Stadium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;3	The two have met five times , with Edberg leading 3-2 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;4	Kafelnikov , ranked No. 11 , is favored against Magnus Larsson in Friday 's second singles match and is the key to Russia 's bid .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;5	He 's won seven straight Davis cup matches since losing in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;6	Russian team captain Vadim Borisov was worried that Sweden could gain momentum early .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;7	`` Frankly , we would have preferred for Kafelnikov to play Larsson in the first match , '' Borisov said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;8	`` But Volkov ... is in great form and I hope that Edberg has big trouble against him . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;9	Sweden should have the edge in Saturday 's doubles competition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;10	Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell are the world 's No. 1 ranked doubles team , and last week they won the ATP world doubles championship in Jakarta .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;11	They will face Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;12	On Sunday , Kafelnikov plays Edberg in their third meeting ; so far they 're tied at 1-1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;13	Volkov plays Larsson , whom he has defeated in their only previous match .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;14	Sweden leads Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup competition , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0305;15	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title ; it is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;0	A Bulgarian diplomat , a stockbroker , two rabbis and a Swiss couple were among 23 people accused of laundering more than dlrs 100 million in drug proceeds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;1	Carlo A. Boccia of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the defendants had a common motivation -- `` greed , a true example of how drug profits do corrupt at all levels of society . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;2	Boccia , special agent in charge of the New York office , said Wednesday that the defendants were part of a money laundering cell that enabled tens of millions of dollars to flow between major U.S. cities and Germany , Switzerland and Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;3	Boccia joined U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White , New York FBI head William A. Gavin and Police Commissioner William Bratton in condemning the alleged participation of otherwise respected professionals in the drug trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;4	`` Money became the narcotic , '' Gavin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;5	`` It shows the pervasive influence of drugs in our society . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;6	`` It is white-collar crime at its worst , '' White said , likening the defendants ' alleged deeds to those of street dealers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;7	`` The range of professions involved in this was surprising and somewhat depressing , '' said White , noting that a lawyer who was arrested practiced often at the federal courthouse in Manhattan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;8	A federal complaint charged 23 defendants with participating in a major international ring that laundered tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;9	Among the group was an assistant manager at Citibank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;10	The organization operated in New York , Los Angeles , Houston , Chicago and Miami in the United States as well as in Germany , Switzerland , Italy , Puerto Rico and Colombia , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;11	During the probe , investigators seized dlrs 5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;12	They arrested all but four of those named in a complaint , which was sealed until Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;13	According to court documents , the leaders of the organization in the United States were Richard Spence , a businessman who was formerly a New York City firefighter ; lawyer Harvey Weinig ; and Robert Hirsch , Weinig 's law partner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;14	Hirsch , 41 , has pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges in a plea bargain with prosecutors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;15	White charged that the three arranged for the pickup of narcotics proceeds from street corners and hotel rooms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;16	Also arrested were Leon Weinmann and his wife , Rachel , of Switzerland , who were lured to the United States for a meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;17	The complaint charged that the Zurich couple received cash and wire transfers and remitted them to bank accounts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;18	Among those allegedly sent as couriers were police Officer Michael T. Kalanz , firefighter Charles Bruno , hospital administrator Gary Salerno , Los Angeles-based stockbroker Donald J. Hayden and rabbis Alexander Schwartz and Menashe Leifer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;19	Also arrested was Latchezar Christov , an honorary consul general for the Republic of Bulgaria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0307;20	Those arrested were charged with conspiracy and money laundering .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;0	Sunburned and scattered on an improvised armada of U.S. Navy ships and cargo boats in the Indian Ocean , the nearly 1,000 survivors of a blaze that swept through the Achille Lauro began the first leg Thursday of their return home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;1	The fire broke out Wednesday morning , reportedly in the engine room , on the bad luck cruise ship -- the Achille Lauro was hijacked in 1985 and an American passenger killed by Palestinian terrorists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;2	Passengers and crew who escaped the blaze by scrambling into lifeboats were transferred Thursday to 10 ships that would take them to Kenya or Djibouti .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;3	Many of the survivors , some dressed in evening or bed clothes , had spent hours aboard the deck of the oil tanker Hawaiian King and other merchant ships that had plucked them to safety immediately after the evacuation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;4	Two elderly passengers died -- an Englishman during the evacuation and a German man of a heart attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;5	Eight people were injured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;6	Starlauro , the Achille Lauro 's owners , said in Naples they were trying to determine if the German died because of the fire or if he had the attack before the early-morning blaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;7	`` The fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down toward the cabins , '' one survivor , Tony Webb , was quoted as telling the London Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;8	Webb , a 44-year-old Briton who now lives in Cape Town , South Africa , had taken his wife and 2-year-old son on the cruise after winning a contest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;9	He said he was still wearing his dinner jacket after a ship dance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;10	`` People were in their evening suits and dressing gowns , '' the paper quoted Webb as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;11	Children screamed and people clung to each other as the Achille Lauro listed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;12	With his son Michael holding on to him in terror Webb looked back and saw flames `` leaping up and there was smoke all around . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;13	'' The crew was wonderful , '' Webb said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;14	`` They tried to keep us all calm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;15	At about 8 a.m. , the captain said the fire was too strong and we would have to abandon the ship . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;16	Starlauro , the cruise ship 's owners , said an SOS was sent at just before 7 a.m. local time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;17	It was unclear what time the fire began .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;18	`` Quite a few people were injured in the transfer -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- -- there 's a few broken bones and some pretty tortured souls , '' John Briand , captain of the oil tanker Lima , told the BBC .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;19	The Achille Lauro 's captain , Giuseppe Orsi , talking by phone Thursday aboard the Hawaiian King , told Italy 's transport minister in Rome that survivors ' morale was high but that clothing was needed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;20	Two Navy ships , the USS Gettysburg and the Halyburton , took on a total of 208 survivors Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;21	'' Many had tears of relief '' as they came aboard the Gettysburg , that ship 's commander , Capt. Pete Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;22	They were offered '' a hot shower , the crew were feeding them ... -LRB- and -RRB- donating clothes for them to wear , as a lot abandoned ship in nightclothes . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;23	Many had bad sunburn after being exposed for hours on the deck of the Hawaiian King , Navy officials reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;24	By Thursday evening , survivors were spread aboard a total of 10 ships .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;25	Five vessels were headed for Djibouti , on the Horn of Africa ; and five for Mombasa , Kenya , with the first due , the Liberian-registered Bar Du , in Djibouti , at 2 p.m. local time -LRB- 1100 gmt -RRB- , the Italian Coast Guard reported Thursday evening .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;26	Others were due in later Friday or Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;27	The ship had carried 581 passengers and 404 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;28	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch or British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;29	RAI state TV said the Italian state airline , Alitalia , would dispatch jumbos to fly out the survivors , except for South Africans , to Italy once they reached port and had a chance to rest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;30	The Achille Lauro set sail Nov. 19 from Genoa , Italy ; stopped in Haifa , Israel , and then plied on to Africa 's east coast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;31	The ship had been bound for South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;32	The Italian liner itself Thursday still hung on , although listing badly to port .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;33	White steam and gray smoke poured out of port side and smaller plumes of smoke drifted out of the lower starboard deck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;34	The pilot of a plane carrying Associated Press cameramen and a reporter put the ship 's position at 160 miles east of the small Somali fishing village of Eil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;35	Heat and soot blackened the Achille Lauro 's two smokestacks , and its blue-and-white paint was scorched and mottled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;36	The ship 's captain reportedly has put the fire 's origin in the engine room , apparently contradicting the company 's initial assertion that the blaze began in the passenger area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;37	Starlauro 's director-general , Franco Zuccherino , told RAI TV Thursday that the fire 's dynamics were yet to be determined .
APW_ENG_19941201.0308;38	`` We have to talk extensively with the captain '' first , Zuccherino said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;0	Governments worldwide must improve crop production or face food shortages due to population growth , dwindling water supplies and shrinking amounts of cultivable land , scientists said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;1	`` At the moment there is no shortfall but looking 20 years down the road we see a different picture , '' Randolph Barker , the new head of the International Irrigation Management Institute told scientists at the 10th anniversary of the organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;2	`` There is an alarming complacency that everything is all right on the food front .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;3	But we must learn to make more food with less land and water , and the research must start now because science takes time , '' said Roberto Lenton , the outgoing director-general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;4	`` The nightmare of world hunger that was stopped by the green revolution in agricultural production in the 1960s may return to haunt us , '' said M.S. Swaminathan , chairman of institute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;5	Global population is projected to total 7.1 billion by the year 2010 , compared to 5.2 today , according to the World Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;6	The amount of water available for irrigation is declining due to increased demands from growing population .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;7	At present , 80 percent of the water is for irrigation , but competition is increasing from household and industrial consumers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;8	The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research , the world body co-ordinating research on food production , is organizing a global initiative on increased water management to solve the problem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0309;9	The irrigation institute , headquartered in Colombo , has been designated the convening center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;0	Computer hackers claiming to represent a shadowy terrorist group breached security codes at a news agency Thursday and sent a message boasting their strength and disavowing links with an alleged police-led crime ring .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;1	Magistrates seized computer disks at the agency , Adnkronos , forcing them to temporarily suspend transmission of news to Italian newspapers and other subscribers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;2	The message -- signed by the `` Falange Armata , '' or Armed Phalanx -- said the group has an arsenal and connections that could `` make the Irish Republican Army shudder . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;3	It said the group planned to carry out more attacks in 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;4	The group has taken credit for many bombings and attacks in the past , but authorities have never proven it was an authentic terrorist cell .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;5	Italian media reports have linked the Falange Armata to an alleged murder and robbery ring led by several police officers in Bologna and surrounding cities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;6	But the computer message said it had no ties to the gang .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;7	The message appeared on computer screens after journalists turned on their terminals , said Carlo Bassi , head of foreign news for the agency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;8	`` It really is worrisome that someone could crack into the system like this , '' said Bassi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0310;9	`` Is showed that it is not far-fetched to think that people could break in and begin sending fake stories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;0	Nick Faldo of England fired eight birdies Thursday en route to a six-under 66 and a two-stroke lead after the first round of the Million Dollar Challenge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;1	A second-place finisher three times in the tournament with golf 's richest first prize -- dlrs 1 million -- Faldo rekindled the precision of his record 77-week run as the world 's top-rated player on a blustery day at the Gary Player Country Club course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;2	In second place were U.S. Open champion Ernie Els of South Africa and Bernhard Langer of Germany , both at four-under-par 68 and three strokes ahead of British Open champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe and Americans Corey Pavin and Tom Lehman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;3	Another threesome -- American Hale Irwin , Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe and Colin Montgomerie of Scotland -- sat a shot back at even par , one stroke ahead of South African David Frost , the only three-time winner of the tournament being held for the 14th straight year at Sun City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;4	Seve Ballesteros of Spain , having trouble off the tees , finished four over par at 76 , still four strokes better than Vijay Singh of Fiji , who had a disastrous back nine to limp home with an 80 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;5	The 12-member field includes six of the world 's 10 top rated players and 11 of the top 20 , including Price , the defending champion and world 's best player this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0311;6	Both Langer and Ballesteros have won the tournament twice previously , while McNulty also is a former champion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;0	Despite its promise to stop delivering military aid to Bosnian Serbs , Yugoslavia has assisted in a crucial attack on northwestern Bosnia , according to Bosnian , Serb , and U.N. reports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;1	The reports released this week raise doubts about Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 's commitment to the aid cutoff he announced in August to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;2	The attack on Bihac in northwest Bosnia called NATO 's bluff to use large-scale force against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;3	It has led to a rapid deterioration in the United Nations ' authority , and on Wednesday , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the 24,000 peacekeepers might have to be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;4	In October , the Bosnian army 's 5th Corps broke out of the Bihac area where government forces are completely surrounded by Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;5	They pushed the Serbs back in a surprise attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;6	But the Serbs counterattacked furiously , and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared Bihac safe haven , which encompasses the town of Bihac and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;7	Fighting there is continuing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;8	Classified U.N. reports , claims by the Bosnian government , and reports by media and reliable sources in Yugoslavia all suggest that fighters and supplies from Yugoslavia have been involved in the combat in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;9	`` It is so obvious that ... Serbs received new weapons , fresh troops ... and fuel to move ` dry ' tanks , '' charged Gen. Jovan Divjak , a Serb who serves as deputy commander of the Bosnian army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;10	`` Otherwise , they would n't have been able to put Bihac under such strong pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;11	Bosnian government officials said intelligence reports indicated fuel and ammunition trucks had crossed the border into Bosnia from Serbia , the main republic in what remains of Yugoslavia , and that armor , helicopters and rockets all had been provided .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;12	In a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday , Charles Thomas , the U.S. representative on a five-nation group seeking peace in Bosnia , told reporters that Milosevic 's clampdown was generally successful , but that the border was `` somewhat porous . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;13	Several hundred international monitors are assigned to check the roughly 500-kilometer -LRB- 300-mile -RRB- Yugoslav-Bosnian border for violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;14	Their reports so far have revealed no violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;15	But reports from Yugoslavia and from U.N. observers indicate that Milosevic may have used the involvement of Serbs from Croatia to get assistance to the Bihac combatants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;16	While Milosevic said he was cutting off help to the Bosnian Serbs , he did not make a similar pledge regarding the Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;17	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had noticed armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;18	The presence of fighters from Yugoslavia in Bosnia also was reported in Milosevic 's Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;19	The Svet weekly , based in the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad , said a special Serbian police unit of up to 1,000 men headed by a top police officer had joined the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;20	The weekly said the policemen crossed into Bosnia as civilians , and traveled through Bosnia to Croatia , where they received weapons and uniforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;21	A senior Serbian police official denied the Svet report .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;22	But reliable sources in Belgrade confirmed that Yugoslav army and police detachments actively took part in the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0312;23	Svet also claimed that the only other republic in Yugoslavia , Montenegro , had shipped a large supply of fuel to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0313;0	Israeli stocks fell 1.6 percent Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0313;1	The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange 's Mishtanim Index stood at 168.3 at the close of trading , down from 171.0 , the exchange announced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0313;2	The index fell some six percent this week , in apparent reaction to a 1.5 percent interest rate hike by the central bank .

APW_ENG_19941201.0315;0	Carlos Graca , this island nation 's new premier , on Thursday declared his private wealth and property to justice officials as part of an anti- corruption campaign that was a key election pledge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;1	Attorney General Silvestre Leite said Graca had listed details of his personal income from sources at home and abroad and had urged other members of his government to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;2	Graca , a 62-year-old doctor , campaigned for and won Oct. 2 elections on a ticket that focussed heavily on stamping out corruption on these idyllic but poor islands of 120,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;3	The move , which is supposed to permit justice officials to spot any irregularities in politicians ' accounts , was unprecedented in Sao Tome and rare for most of the rest of Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;4	Earlier this year , former Trade Minister Alzemiro dos Prazeres was accused of diverting dlrs 20,000 from his ministry 's coffers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;5	Sao Tome has a legally fixed minimum salary of 10,000 dobras -LRB- dlrs 12.50 -RRB- but many islanders earn even less .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;6	The former government 's popularity slumped in the October poll and Graca 's Liberation Movement for Sao Tome and Principe , a formerly Marxist party that now calls itself Social Democrat , returned to power .
APW_ENG_19941201.0315;7	It had established a one-party state in Sao Tome after independence from Portugal in 1975 but then allowed first multi-party elections in 1991 and went into opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;0	National Hockey League officials began arriving Thursday in a downtown hotel for talks they hope will solve the labor dispute and save the North American ice hockey season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;1	`` I am always hopeful , '' commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday as he walked past television cameras and into an elevator .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;2	`` It 's fair to say that with each passing day , the meeting that is coming up is more crucial , '' Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden said Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;3	To show how serious the negotiators are : They have reserved room space in a Chicago hotel for three days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;4	Both sides agree that the latest meetings are pivotal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;5	`` There is an urgency , '' said Troy Loney , player representative of the New York Islanders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;6	`` The meetings here in Chicago in the next couple of days are vital to find out whether there 's going to be a season or not , '' said Jeremy Roenick of the Chicago Blackhawks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;7	`` We have to make sure we let everybody know we did n't strike .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;8	The owners locked us out . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;9	`` It 's getting to the point where they are going to have to make a decision -LRB- on the Collective Bargaining Agreement -RRB- , '' a management source told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;10	The owners lockout has forced a work stoppage that is now in its 62nd day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;11	So far , 347 games have been called off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;12	The schedule is already down from 84 to 60 games , following the cancellation of 24 for each of the 26 teams .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;13	Owners have said they will accept no less than a 50-game schedule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;14	A settlement beyond the middle of December would sorely test that ideal , given the fact that players need at least two weeks to get ready for the season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;15	The main issue is the owners ' desire for a salary cap , a limit each team could spend on player salaries , as a way to control costs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;16	They have amended that to a `` luxury tax '' -- meaning teams could spend over a set limit , but must pay an additional `` tax '' into a pool that smaller-market teams could utilize to strenghen their rosters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;17	At one time strongly opposed to any kind of cap , players have softened their stance on a salary cap for first-year or rookie players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;18	But they still have n't come to terms on the numbers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;19	Reportedly , owners would like a maximum cap for rookie salaries set at around dlrs 750,000 a season , while players would prefer around dlrs 1.5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;20	Players on Thursday were expected to present the owners with their thoughts on other major issues such as free agency and salary arbritration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;21	The contentious luxury tax issue is another story , however .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;22	`` If the tax is on the table , there 's trouble , '' Loney said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;23	It may not get to that point if the negotiators can find a way to put a drag on rising salaries in other areas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;24	`` We just have n't finished the review process of anything outside of the tax , '' Sinden told The Canadian Press on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;25	`` Until we do , I do n't think Bettman can make any statement about the tax .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;26	`` It depends if we can slow down the problems the league is trying to correct .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;27	But that has not been determined because we have not reached agreement on all these points .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;28	We have not had a chance to add it up . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;29	Until now , owners have insisted on a tax of team payrolls that go over the average team salary and give the money to those under the prescribed limit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;30	The players have been against such a tax , believing it has the same effect as a salary cap .
APW_ENG_19941201.0316;31	Players reportedly would accept a diminished version of the payroll tax if owners share the burden by taxing gate receipts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0319;0	The decision to support the expansion of the alliance came on the opening day of a two-day conference of allied foreign ministers whose talks were likely to be overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0319;1	`` Today , we take an important step in the process that will lead to NATO expansion , '' said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in addressing his counterparts at the opening session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0319;2	`` The United States believes it is time to begin the process -- to begin deliberate consideration of the practical requirements for adding new members to the alliance , '' he said in the text of his speech .
APW_ENG_19941201.0319;3	The decision to authorize the study , though , is a cautious move forward in drawing former adversaries anxious for membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0319;4	`` We have a moral duty not to squander this historic opportunity to anchor the new democracies of central and eastern Europe permanently in the West , '' said NATO Secretary-general Willy Claes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;0	The study -- dubbed an `` owner 's manual '' for NATO membership -- will take a year to complete .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;1	It will not name candidates for membership , nor will it set a deadline for admittance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;2	Instead , it will focus on such questions as whether NATO troops will need to be based in new member states ; how much enlargement will cost ; how to integrate the newcomers army into NATO 's command structure
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;3	To counter Russian worries about an eastward expansion of NATO , the allies intend later Thursday to endorse a sweeping military cooperation program with Russia and agree to hold regular talks with Moscow on security matters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;4	Russian officials have registered apprehension about the movement of NATO 's territory farther east , and alliance leaders have gone out of their way to try to strengthen separate ties with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;5	`` Russia is a part of Europe , '' said the NATO source , who insisted on anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;6	`` You can not have a security system without the participation of Russia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;7	The ministers , he said , emphasized the importance of `` increasing the momentum '' of consultations between NATO and Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;8	The United States had initially proposed a six-month study of enlargement , but the Europeans , mindful of Moscow 's concerns , extended it to 12 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;9	`` We should avoid premature enlargement that gives the impression that we seek a redivision of the European continent , '' said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , according to a spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;10	The allies do not intend to identify candidates for membership , nor set a date for admission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;11	But the NATO source said , `` Central European states would be first . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;12	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered front-runners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;13	Despite attempts to keep the focus on new members , the Bosnian crisis will no doubt occupy a large amount of the ministers ' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;14	During the talks , Christopher was expected to tell the allies the Clinton administration has swung behind their view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;15	It marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the European allies , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;16	The change in U.S. policy will help heal an unprecedented rift within the alliance over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;17	At a breakfast with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , Christopher reviewed the warning U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delivered Wednesday that unless warring Serbs and Muslims cooperate with the U.N. mission the peacekeepers might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;18	Hurd said he may go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , this weekend to preach reconciliation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;19	Officials said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe may join him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;20	The latest American approach centers on a call for an international peace conference that would let Bosnian Serbs seek changes in the peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;21	That plan would require them to cut their holdings in Bosnia from 70 percent to 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;22	The Clinton administration , officials say , is also leaning toward approval of political ties between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia proper -- a big step toward their aim of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;23	On Friday , Christopher will meet with here his counterparts from France , Germany , Britain and Russia to discuss new plans to revive their moribund peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;24	France and Britain have been criticized in the U.S. Congress for refusing to let the United Nations use the Western military alliance 's air power to the full .
APW_ENG_19941201.0320;25	In turn , Congress has forced the Clinton administration to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia 's Muslim-led government , something the European NATO allies oppose for fear it would escalate the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;0	Gulf Daily News , Manama , Bahrain , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;1	Bosnian Serbs were ... on the verge of military victory in Bihac -- and five major world powers seeking a peace settlement seem powerless to stop them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;2	The statement issued after ... French talks feebly demanded an immediate cease-fire -- and Washington , Moscow , Paris , London and Bonn are clinging to a facade of unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;3	Pledges to continue diplomatic efforts are now not enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;4	An ultimatum is needed followed by strong NATO intervention to save Bihac and prevent the resulting massacre .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;5	This could be preceded by an extension of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' around the town , using NATO air power to enforce it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;6	For this , European allies would need to plough in extra ground troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;7	Without such drastic action the Western alliance 's already discredited policy in Bosnia will completely collapse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;8	Jerusalem Post on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;9	The new sniping between Europeans and the United States over the humiliation of the United Nations in Bosnia is a disturbing sign of how deeply this cancerous war has eaten into the monolithic Atlantic alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;10	What has also emerged from the fall of the Bihac `` safe area '' is that European states have been tilting steadily toward a Russian , rather than American , foreign policy perspective .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;11	This is a development which has implications far beyond the mess in what was once Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;12	The grand coalition of over 30 states that converged to liberate Kuwait from the grasp of -LRB- Iraq 's -RRB- Saddam Hussein now seems as far away as the Cold War itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;13	le Figaro , Paris , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;14	The conflict in Bosnia has revealed the true state of relations between the United States and Europe in the area of defense .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;15	It 's no exaggeration to say the divergences are deep , for the basic reason that the U.S. administration does n't consider its strategic interests threatened by the torching of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;16	The Europeans , in contrast , fear that the rewards given to the aggressor will encourage him to pursue his policy of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Macedonia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;17	... It is high time to engage in a deep reflection on NATO , and that the Europeans and Americans become aware of the danger of this family quarrel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;18	Nihon Keizai Shinbun , Tokyo , on guns :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;19	Recent shooting incidents like the one in which a waitress was shot in the head in a restaurant robbery are on the rise in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;20	... What really points up the seriousness of the problem is that now it is n't just gangsters , but ordinary citizens who are being targeted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;21	What 's really terrifying about guns is that , compared with the powerful effort and will to kill required to murder with a knife or sword , there 's very little psychological deterrent for someone killing from a distance with a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;22	Serious discussion is needed to make sure that Japan , which was the safest country in the world , does not become a gun society like America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;23	The Australian , Sydney , Australia , on Japan 's `` comfort women '' :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;24	Japan 's rejection of the recommendation by the International Commission of Jurists that it should pay compensation to surviving `` comfort women '' forced into sexual slavery during World War II is regrettable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;25	It indicates a return to the attitude that predominated among Japan 's immediate postwar generations -- to disguise the past by contriving not to discuss it -- and represents a setback for the gradual attempts of recent years to reflect on the war through more open , honest and mature debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;26	The Geneva-based ICJ took 19 months to find that up to 200,000 women -- mainly from Korea but also from the Philippines , Taiwan and China -- were forced to work as prostitutes in military brothels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;27	However , the Japanese government rejected the report within 24 hours , saying it did not recognize the ICJ and would not be responding to its findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;28	If Japan is serious about properly mending its international relationships , and participating fully in the regional economy on any footing other than economic mastery , it needs to do more to acknowledge its wartime record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;29	Making due reparations to survivors of brutality in the occupied countries should be part of that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;30	The Financial Times , London , on the European Union :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;31	In the hearts of Europe 's policy makers , hope springs eternal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;32	Faster-than-expected recovery from recession has revived the idea that a group of countries centered on Germany could attain economic and monetary union as early as 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;33	Yet there is an unfortunate corollary to the improved prospects for the European `` core . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;34	Economic divergences in the Continent 's periphery , particularly the European Union 's southern members , are increasing at a disconcerting pace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;35	Action to cope with the south 's economic challenges has been half-hearted or curbed by political difficulties or both .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;36	The south 's structural weaknesses can not be overcome without painful measures , particularly in reforming labor markets and welfare systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;37	... Yet without such restructuring , the task of adjustment will become still more difficult .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;38	If growth migrates permanently from the south , the EU is unlikely to be robust enough to enlarge itself to the east .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;39	Al-Arab , Doha , Qatar , on the European Union :
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;40	The European Union 's steps to reinstate its own independent decision-making by rebuffing U.S.-diktat and shedding off the Israeli hegemony is laudable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;41	The newest evidence of this orientation is the opening by the EU of a new chapter of understanding with Syria by lifting the arms embargo imposed in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;42	The EU move would restore the Continent 's key Mideast role , which had dwindled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;43	The strong words by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on the European move unveils Israel 's intention to dictate its own version of the settlement conditions on Syria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;44	The lifting of the arms embargo on Syria caused serious dissatisfaction for the Israelis , who wanted to pressure Syria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;45	The German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , who is also the present EU chairman , should be praised for asserting that the statements of Peres are offending to the entire Europe , a key aid-donor to the Middle East peace process and the Palestinian national self-rule authority .
APW_ENG_19941201.0321;46	Kinkel 's response is a strong-worded message to various sides , especially Israel and the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;0	A solid knock by Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar helped India establish a comfortable 230 for four against West Indies on the opening day of the second test , which was otherwise marred by mobs that hurled rocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;1	The game was stopped twice -- for a total of one hour -- as West Indies skipper Courtney Walsh led his team off the field as the crowd in this central Indian city hurled soft drink bottles , fruit and rocks on to the field .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;2	Referee Raman Subba Row blamed the local authorities for poor crowd control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;3	Police later ringed the field .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;4	It was not immediately clear why the crowd became irate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;5	`` We are lucky that no one was seriously hurt , '' Row said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;6	Stuart Williams was hit before lunch , while Phil Simmons at deep extra cover region was hit with a piece of fruit just after tea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;7	In the morning , India , which is 1-0 in the three-test series , won the toss and opted to bat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;8	Sidhu and Tendulkar established a splendid 177 partnership in about three hours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;9	Sidhu scored 107 , his sixth test century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;10	His strokes were confident as he hit a total of 17 fours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;11	But he offered a simple catch to wicketkeeper Murray off Carl Hooper .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;12	Tendulkar was unbeaten with 81 and at the end of the day , he had hit a dozen boundaries off 155 balls in just over three hours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;13	Venkatapathy Raju came in to bat as the night watchman after Sidhu was sent to the stands , but he could not stay long and ell to paceman Walsh caught by Brian Adams for two .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;14	Off-spinner Hooper struck as soon as he pressed into the attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0324;15	Bowling a good line and turning the ball just enough to beat the bat , he dislodged Manoj Prabhakar and Vinod Kambli in quick succession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;0	Speakers and activists at a 42-nation summit on AIDS pleaded Thursday for compassion for homosexuals , drug users and prostitutes often shunned by politicians and the public .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;1	Governments should redouble their efforts to end discrimination against these groups , at high risk of becoming infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS , participants said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;2	`` All laws which deny the freedom of people to cross borders because of HIV must be abolished , '' said Richard Burzynski , an HIV sufferer with a Canada-based AIDS rights group , ICASO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;3	`` This means all laws which criminalize or discriminate against homosexuals , drug users , migrants and refugees , and sex workers must be abolished . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;4	Governments tend to ignore or isolate homosexuals , worsening rather than addressing the AIDS epidemic , the International Gay and Lesbian Association said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;5	Homosexuals must be accepted , educated and protected by legislation , the group said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;6	Officials of the 42 participating nations endorsed a declaration pledging to strengthen cooperation between developed and Third World countries and to fight discrimination against those suffering from AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;7	`` We are not meeting here simply to issue a further warning , but to declare a planetary emergency , '' said U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;8	`` Every day , AIDS kills children , destroys families , drains economies , threatens communities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;9	We must act without delays . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;10	The non-binding declaration says signatories will act to `` ensure that all persons living with HIV\/AIDS are able to realize the full and equal enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;11	The declaration promised efforts to provide health care , jobs , education and housing to people with HIV or AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;12	It also supported `` empowerment of women '' by raising their economic and social status and including them in decision-making .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;13	The summit was a focal point of World AIDS Day , observed around the world with education programs and fund-raising events .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;14	Australians attended special church services commemorating 3,500 compatriots killed by AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;15	In the Ivory Coast , where AIDS is the leading killer of young men , 2,000 people marched through Abidjan with banners declaring , `` Condoms for life ; AIDS for death . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;16	In South Africa , where the disease is spreading rapidly , health officials and politicians wrapped a huge red ribbon around St. George 's Cathedral in Cape Town as part of efforts to increase AIDS awareness .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;17	In Paris , hundreds of teen-agers visited a `` village '' set up across the Seine river from the Eiffel Tower , with scores of stands offering brochures , condoms and other educational material .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;18	About 50 members of the AIDS group Act Up lay on the Champs Elysees to show solidarity with HIV victims .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;19	They blocked traffic for several minutes before leaving the boulevard .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;20	At the summit , there were numerous calls for more AIDS spending , starting with Federico Mayor , head of the U.N. Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;21	`` In our budgets we have funds to pay the price of war , but we have made no provision for the cost of the fight against AIDS , '' Mayor said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;22	Funding `` must be accompanied by ethical surveillance to prevent or check any measures ... that would tend to exclude or discriminate against people who are ill from the disease , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;23	The World Bank , the biggest donor in the campaign against AIDS , pledged dlrs 150 million annually to combat the disease in developing countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;24	Britain announced an allocation of 230 million pounds -LRB- dlrs 358 million -RRB- on AIDS services for 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;25	Currently , however , more than 90 percent of the money pledged to fight AIDS goes toward helping only the 8 percent of those afflicted in developed countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;26	Some 17 million people are known to have been infected with the HIV virus , about two-thirds in Africa , the World Health Organization says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;27	Up to 40 million will have been infected by 2000 , and 10 million will have died , according to WHO , co-sponsor of the summit with the French government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;28	Some French media pronounced the summit a failure even before it began .
APW_ENG_19941201.0325;29	The daily Liberation criticized the final declaration as `` banal , '' predicted that little new funding would materialize , and noted that senior U.S. , British or German leaders rebuffed summit invitations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;0	Despite its promise to stop delivering military aid to Bosnian Serbs , Yugoslavia has assisted in a crucial attack on northwestern Bosnia , according to Bosnian , Serb , and U.N. reports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;1	The reports released this week raise doubts about Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 's commitment to the aid cutoff he announced in August to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;2	The attack on Bihac in northwest Bosnia called NATO 's bluff to use large-scale force against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;3	It has led to a rapid deterioration in the United Nations ' authority , and on Wednesday , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the 24,000 peacekeepers might have to be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;4	In October , the Bosnian army 's 5th Corps broke out of the Bihac area where government forces are completely surrounded by Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;5	They pushed the Serbs back in a surprise attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;6	But the Serbs counterattacked furiously , and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared Bihac safe haven , which encompasses the town of Bihac and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;7	Fighting there is continuing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;8	Classified U.N. reports , claims by the Bosnian government , and reports by media and reliable sources in Yugoslavia all suggest that fighters and supplies from Yugoslavia have been involved in the combat in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;9	`` It is so obvious that ... Serbs received new weapons , fresh troops ... and fuel to move ` dry ' tanks , '' charged Gen. Jovan Divjak , a Serb who serves as deputy commander of the Bosnian army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;10	`` Otherwise , they would n't have been able to put Bihac under such strong pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;11	Bosnian government officials said intelligence reports indicated fuel and ammunition trucks had crossed the border into Bosnia from Serbia , the main republic in what remains of Yugoslavia , and that armor , helicopters and rockets all had been provided .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;12	In a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday , Charles Thomas , the U.S. representative on a five-nation group seeking peace in Bosnia , told reporters that Milosevic 's clampdown was generally successful , but that the border was `` somewhat porous . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;13	Several hundred international monitors are assigned to check the roughly 500-kilometer -LRB- 300-mile -RRB- Yugoslav-Bosnian border for violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;14	Their reports so far have revealed no violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;15	But reports from Yugoslavia and from U.N. observers indicate that Milosevic may have used the involvement of Serbs from Croatia to get assistance to the Bihac combatants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;16	While Milosevic said he was cutting off help to the Bosnian Serbs , he did not make a similar pledge regarding the Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;17	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had noticed armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;18	The presence of fighters from Yugoslavia in Bosnia also was reported in Milosevic 's Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;19	The Svet weekly , based in the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad , said a special Serbian police unit of up to 1,000 men headed by a top police officer had joined the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;20	The weekly said the policemen crossed into Bosnia as civilians , and traveled through Bosnia to Croatia , where they received weapons and uniforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;21	A senior Serbian police official denied the Svet report .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;22	But reliable sources in Belgrade confirmed that Yugoslav army and police detachments actively took part in the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0326;23	Svet also claimed that the only other republic in Yugoslavia , Montenegro , had shipped a large supply of fuel to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;0	Michel Saleh of Lebanon in a Toyota Celica swept into the lead in the Dubai International Rally on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;1	The first day of the two-day 1994 FIA Middle East Championship produced a double early blow and a quick exit for the two national stars , who had been expected to dominate the event .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;2	Middle East champion Mohammed bin Sulayem of Dubai in a Ford Cosworth slipped five minutes off the pace while Sheik Suhail bin Khalifa al-Maktoum went out with mechanical problems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;3	At the end of four stages , Saleh led by 2 minutes and 12 seconds over Qatar 's Nasser Khalifa al-Attiyah in a Toyota , with Victory Rally Team 's Khalifa al-Mataywi in another Toyota Celica only two seconds back in third place .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;4	Saleh completed the four stages in 29 minutes , 27 seconds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;5	Sharjah 's Sheik Abdullah al-Qassimi in a Mitsubish Galant , with 34:14 , held fourth place and Germany 's national champion Karl-Heinz Lerch in a Ford Cosworth was fifth at 34:24 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;6	Middle East Group N champion Abdullah Bakhashab of Saudi Arabia was sixth in his Toyota , two seconds behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0327;7	British women 's national champion Stephanie Simmonite in a Volkswagon Golf was 11th in 43:32 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;0	The U.N. mediator for Angola was in Zaire Thursday trying to persuade UNITA rebel officials to return here for the first time in two years and help oversee a truce and power-sharing deal to end 19 years of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;1	U.N. officials said Alioune Blondin Beye had left for Zaire late Wednesday , delaying a planned visit Thursday to New York where he was to brief the U.N. Security Council on the shaky 10-day-old truce .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;2	Both UNITA and the government have accused each other of violating the cease-fire called Nov. 22 , two days after a peace treaty was signed in Lusaka , Zambia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;3	But there has been a general reduction in fighting across the war-ravaged nation and the U.N. mission here has deployed its first military observers to six sites .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;4	A 7,000-strong U.N. peace keeping force has been promised to anchor the treaty that should lead to power sharing between government and rebels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;5	But blue helmeted troops will only be deployed once the truce is seen to be holding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;6	Angola 's war erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 , has killed a half-million Angolans and left millions more threatened by starvation and disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;7	Peace accords in 1991 brought a brief respite but UNITA lost multiparty elections a year later , cried foul and returned to war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;8	Beye , broker of the year-long talks in Lusaka that produced the accord , last week announced UNITA officials would return to Luanda for the first time since losing the elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;9	But the rebels did not show , citing logistics difficulties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;10	Leaders of UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- have been on the run since their main base in the central city of Huambo fell to the government early November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;11	Rebel chief Jonas Savimbi has not been seen in public for months , prompting rumors he had been killed or wounded in a government attack , or that he was seriously ill and was being treated in Zaire or Morocco .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;12	The U.N. mission in Angola has posted military observers in six cities : Uige , Huambo , Luena , Menongue , Saurimo and Lubango .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;13	Government sources working closely with the U.N. mission say initial plans foresee deploying 7,450 blue helmeted peace keepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;14	The largest contingents are to be posted in the war-torn north and center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;15	The central provinces of Huambo , Bie , Benguela and Cuanza-Sul will receive 2,000 peacekeepers , while Luanda and the north will get 1,800 , according to the plans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0329;16	The rebels ' former southern headquarters , Jamba , is also to be a peace keeping base , the sources said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0330;0	Guy Debord , an avant-garde essayist who influenced the upheavals of French society in the late 1960s , has committed suicide .

APW_ENG_19941201.0330;3	Little-known outside France , Debord denounced what he called `` the show-biz society '' and declared that performing arts should be based on powerful emotions , passions and sexual desire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0330;4	His ideas were influential among theoreticians and essayists who achieved prominence in the May 1968 student-led cultural revolt that shook French society .
APW_ENG_19941201.0332;0	Relief pitcher Mitch `` Wild Thing '' Williams is getting a new life in American Major League Baseball with the California Angels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0332;1	Williams has n't pitched since a disappointing stint with the Houston Astros ended in his release May 31 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0332;2	He was 1-4 with six saves and a 7.65 ERA in 25 appearances last season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0332;3	The Angels said Wednesday that Williams agreed to a non-guaranteed contract .
APW_ENG_19941201.0332;4	It calls for a base salary of dlrs 500,000 , with dlrs 2 million in performance bonuses .

APW_ENG_19941201.0335;2	The money , which would have to be approved by the new Republican-controlled Congress , would help cover a dlrs 40 billion shortfall over five years that had been created by a congressionally required pay raise , and by inflation , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0335;3	`` It focuses , however , on the issue of readiness -- making sure the force is able to conduct and win the nation 's wars , '' one of the senior officials said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0343;15	A bloody broom handle was found near Dahmer , but investigators have said his head might have been beaten against a wall or the floor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0343;16	He was n't pronounced dead until he was taken to a hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;0	Arsenal striker Paul Merson agreed Thursday to check into a rehabilitation clinic for treatment of his self-confessed cocaine habit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;1	Merson , 26 , admitted in a newspaper interview last week that he regularly spent 150 pounds -LRB- dlrs 230 -RRB- a night supporting his addiction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;2	He also said he had run up large gambling debts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;3	`` Paul Merson was very frank about those problems , '' English soccer officials said in a statement following a meeeting with the player .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;4	`` They are considerable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;5	Taking drugs -- to which we are all bitterly opposed -- is only one of them , and arguably not the biggest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;6	In our view , a complex and unprecedented situation demands that the first priority must be rehabilitation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;7	The statement said Merson agreed to enter a clinic selected by the Football Association for a period of treatment of at least six weeks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;8	He will not be allowed to play during that time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;9	Following treatment , he will be subject to monitoring and random tests for up to 18 months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0345;10	When he returns to soccer will depend on the agreement of medical specialists , FA officials and Arsenal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;0	A rebel Serb assembly that met Thursday was expected to endorse an economic agreement with Croatia despite two days of artillery duels between the two sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;1	Croatia 's army and Serbs lobbed artillery shells at each other most of the past two days , said U.N. spokesman Paul Risley .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;2	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confronations since ending their 7-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;3	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;4	Artillery duels continued Thursday in the same locations close to Knin , Risley said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;5	Reporters in the nearby Croatian port of Split saw unusual activity by Croatian army helicopters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;6	Negotiations between the two sides have been stalled , but the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in this Croatian Serb stronghold approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;7	If accepted , it would be the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their seven-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;8	The draft agreement under discussion at the closed-door Knin meeting calls for restoration of water and electricity supply and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;9	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;10	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb Krajina region into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;11	Croatian Serb leaders rejected the economic accord two weeks ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;12	Now , after meeting Milosevic , they have dropped those objections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;13	However , the session started amid fresh threats of possible new warfare between Croatia and rebel Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;14	Croatia is chafing at Serb control over one-third of its territory , and holds out the option of taking the territory back by force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;15	And Croatian officials warned they were ready to intervene in the Bihac pocket in northwestern Bosnia when rebel Serbs from Croatia crossed the border to fight Bosnia 's Muslim-led army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;16	They say the fighting proves that Croats must look out for their own security .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;17	Nevertheless , officials in Knin seemed in a positive mood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;18	`` I expect the assembly to approve the agreement , '' Milan Babic , the Croatian Serb `` foreign minister '' told reporters before the session .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;19	He said that `` economic relations will not prejudge political solution . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;20	U.N. sources in Knin said that Borislav Mikelic , the rebel Serb prime minister , was expected to sign the agreement at a local U.N. headquarters on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;21	Croatian officials refused to sign the agreement Thursday because the first Yugoslavia , called The Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , was formed Dec. 1 , 1918 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;22	The Croats are expected to sign at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , the Croatian capital , on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;23	Croatian authorities , who reject any reminder of former Yugoslavia , have already endorsed the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;24	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since a tenuous cease-fire was reached in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0347;25	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941201.0348;0	Gasoline prices and the salaries of government workers will go up by 20 percent , the military government said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0348;1	A statement said the government had been subsidizing pump prices of fuel despite increased prices on the international market .
APW_ENG_19941201.0348;2	`` Regrettably , this situation is no longer tenable , especially when the government needs to generate optimum resources to pursue the rebel war , '' the statement explained .
APW_ENG_19941201.0348;3	Last week , the government launched a huge offensive against southern-based rebels who have been fighting to overthrow the government since 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0348;4	Gasoline goes up by 20 percent to 1,650 leones -LRB- dlrs 2.75 -RRB- a gallon -LRB- 3.8 liters -RRB- immediately , while government workers will get pay rises from January .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;0	President Hafez Assad on Thursday again held Israel responsible for the deadlock in peace talks with Syria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;1	Speaking in a joint news conference after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Assad said `` the situation of peace talks on the Syrian track is still unchanged and no progress has been made . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;2	The Syrian leader said Israel was `` making demands that Syria can never accept . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;3	He did not specify the demands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;4	Mubarak 's visit came a few days ahead of a scheduled trip to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher , his sixth this year in an effort to break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;5	These have been stalled since February over Syria 's demand that Israel declare its willingness to make a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;6	Israel captured the strategic plateau in southwestern Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;7	Israel has so far only offered a partial withdrawal phased over several years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;8	Damascus has rejected that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;9	In reply to a question , Assad denied that `` any side has discussed with Syria the question of deploying U.S. forces in the Golan . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;10	President Clinton assured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last month that he would consider sending U.S. troops to the Golan as part of an international peacekeeping force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;11	Egyptian sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Mubarak had been expected to brief Assad on the outcome of his recent tour of European capitals , where he sought financial aid for the Palestinian National Authority .
APW_ENG_19941201.0349;12	Mubarak flew back to Egypt after the news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;0	The U.N. mediator for Angola was in Zaire Thursday trying to persuade UNITA rebel officials to return here for the first time in two years and help oversee a truce and power-sharing deal to end 19 years of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;1	U.N. officials said Alioune Blondin Beye had left for Zaire late Wednesday , delaying a planned visit Thursday to New York where he was to brief the U.N. Security Council on the shaky 10-day-old truce .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;2	Both UNITA and the government have accused each other of violating the cease-fire called Nov. 22 , two days after a peace treaty was signed in Lusaka , Zambia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;3	But there has been a general reduction in fighting across the war-ravaged nation and the U.N. mission here has deployed its first military observers to six sites .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;4	A 7,000-strong U.N. peace keeping force has been promised to anchor the treaty that should lead to power sharing between government and rebels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;5	But blue helmeted troops will only be deployed once the truce is seen to be holding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;6	Angola 's war erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 , has killed a half-million Angolans and left millions more threatened by starvation and disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;7	Peace accords in 1991 brought a brief respite but UNITA lost multiparty elections a year later , cried foul and returned to war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;8	Beye , broker of the year-long talks in Lusaka that produced the accord , last week announced UNITA officials would return to Luanda for the first time since losing the elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;9	But the rebels did not show , citing logistics difficulties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;10	Leaders of UNITA - the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola - have been on the run since their main base in the central city of Huambo fell to the government early November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;11	Rebel chief Jonas Savimbi has not been seen in public for months , prompting rumors he had been killed or wounded in a government attack , or that he was seriously ill and was being treated in Zaire or Morocco .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;12	The U.N. mission in Angola has posted military observers in six cities : Uige , Huambo , Luena , Menongue , Saurimo and Lubango .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;13	Government sources working closely with the U.N. mission say initial plans foresee deploying 7,450 blue helmeted peace keepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;14	The largest contingents are to be posted in the war-torn north and center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;15	The central provinces of Huambo , Bie , Benguela and Cuanza-Sul will receive 2,000 peacekeepers , while Luanda and the north will get 1,800 , according to the plans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0350;16	The rebels ' former southern headquarters , Jamba , is also to be a peace keeping base , the sources said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;0	Yasser Arafat 's government on Thursday took control of the health and taxation systems in the West Bank , broadening Palestinian autonomy despite a pall cast on peacemaking by a series of Islamic terror attacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;1	The move completed the initial stage of handing over day-to-day affairs in the West Bank to Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;2	It also came amid growing calls in Israel for shutting off Palestinians from Israel because of a series of attacks in which 32 Israelis have been killed since early October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;3	About 1,000 people gathered Thursday in the northern Israeli town of Afula for the funeral of the latest victim , 19-year-old woman soldier Liat Gabai , who was axed to death on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;4	A suspect detained Wednesday , Wahib Abu Rub , 24 , from the West Bank town of Qabatiyah , has told interrogators he was from the Islamic Resistance Movement or Hamas , Israel radio said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;5	The same group claimed the Oct. 19 Tel Aviv bus bombing that killed 22 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;6	`` I killed the soldier , '' Abu Rub confessed on Israel television , as he was led by police to a West Bank court Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;7	Police Minister Moshe Shahal responded by calling Thursday for completely shutting off the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;8	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;9	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;10	A closure could also bring further violence , by preventing thousands of Palestinian day workers from entering Israel to earn a living .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;11	Palestinian and Israeli leaders have blamed growing support for Islamic radicals on economic troubles in the PLO-run Gaza Strip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;12	Despite the violence , talks were expected to begin next week on stage two of the autonomy given Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho last May -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;13	Israel 's concern for the safety of 120,000 Jewish settlers has prompted some officials to propose skipping the interim phase altogether and negotiating the final status of these territories now , rather than in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;14	Still , a gradual hand over of responsibilities to Palestinians proceeded in the West Bank where two ceremonies were held marking the transfer of the health and tax systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;15	The PLO has since August also taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;16	`` What we have completed gives the Palestinians a first entrance to the West Bank , '' said West Bank military governor Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar , signing over the tax department to Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi in Ramallah .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;17	In Brussels , foreign donors this week released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier , mostly to help the Palestinians meet running costs for a few months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;18	Deputy Finance Minister Atef Alawneh said he hoped to collect dlrs 300-400 million annually in taxes , and remarked , `` we can not depend for the rest of our lives on the donor countries and the foreign investors in building our Palestinian state . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;19	George Rishmawi , a Beit Zahour textile factory owner , once jailed by Israel for boycotting military government taxes was hopeful about what he called the start of `` a new era .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;20	We have paid the Israelis enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;21	They ripped us off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0351;22	They were thieves with licenses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;0	Egypt wants to buy 12 more Apache helicopters from McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems here in a deal valued at dlrs 318 million , federal officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;1	The Pentagon notified Congress on Wednesday of Egypt 's request .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;2	Lawmakers have about a month after convening in January to approve the proposed sale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;3	If there are no objections from Congress , negotiations would begin between the U.S. Army and Egypt on the final price and delivery dates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;4	The Army is responsible for the sale of Apaches to foreign governments under U.S. foreign military-sales regulations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;5	This is Egypt 's second Apache order .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;6	The country has taken delivery of all 24 Apaches ordered in January 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0352;7	A total of 104 Apaches , which are the U.S. Army 's main attack helicopter , have been sold to Egypt , Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates , Israel and Greece .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;0	Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar combined for a 177-run partnership and helped India establish a comfortable 230 for four Thursday , the opening day of the second test against the West Indies which was marred by a rock - and bottle-throwing crowd .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;1	The match was stopped twice -- for a total of one hour -- as West Indies skipper Courtney Walsh took his team off the field in the face of flying soft drink bottles , fruit and rocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;2	Referee Raman Subba Row blamed the local authorities for poor crowd control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;3	Police later ringed the field .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;4	It was not immediately clear why the crowd became irate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;5	`` We are lucky that no one was seriously hurt , '' Row said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;6	Stuart Williams was hit before lunch , while Phil Simmons at deep extra cover region was hit with a piece of fruit just after tea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;7	In the morning , India , which won the opener of the three-test series , won the toss and opted to bat .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;8	Sidhu scored his sixth test century , including 17 fours , and Tendulkar added an unbeaten 81 in sharing a three-hour third-wicket stand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;9	Sidhu was out for 107 offering a simple catch to wicketkeeper Murray off Carl Hooper .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;10	Tendulkar had a dozen boundaries off 155 balls in just over three hours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;11	Venkatapathy Raju came in to bat as the night watchman after Sidhu was sent to the stands , but he could not stay long and fell to paceman Walsh caught by Brian Adams for two .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;12	Off-spinner Hooper struck as soon as he pressed into the attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0353;13	Bowling a good line and turning the ball just enough to beat the bat , he dislodged Manoj Prabhakar and Vinod Kambli in quick succession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;0	Ernesto Zedillo , a mild-mannered economist whose rise to power capped a tragic and tumultous year of rebellion and political assassination , was sworn in Thursday as the 63rd president of Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;1	`` I assume the duties of president with honor , '' said Zedillo after taking up the red-green-and-white presidential sash in a ceremony before 1,500 Mexican and foreign leaders at the ornate Chamber of Deputies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;2	Zedillo vowed that the Mexican army will maintain the cease-fire in Chiapas state , where Indian rebels are threatening to resume fighting that erupted Jan. 1 at a cost of more than 145 lives .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;3	`` The Mexican army will unilateraly maintain the cease-fire , '' promised Zedillo , wearing a dark suit and silk tie in his first address to the nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;4	`` There will not be violence in Chiapas . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;5	He added that he hoped the guerrilla fighters would not renew their violent campaign , saying Mexico must unite in a common fight to eradicate the poverty that sowed rebellion and open a dialogue for peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;6	Zedillo promised to launch a war on poverty that would bring greater prosperity to millions of his 90 million compatriots untouched by the free-trade economic reforms of his predecessor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;7	Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada , was loudly applauded as Zedillo paid him tribute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;8	`` Carlos Salinas de Gortari will always have my gratitude and the appreciation of the people of Mexico , '' said Zedillo after taking up the presidential sash , which he will hold through the end of the century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;9	`` Mexico has prospered and our fathers achieved great advances .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;10	But those are n't enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;11	Millions of Mexicans are lacking the basics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;12	Millions live on the margin , millions live in undignified poverty , '' said Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;13	Outside the hall where Zedillo spoke , military bands struck up martial waltzes and Mexican mariachi musicians warmed up a huge street fiesta on the parade route to the National Palace , festive in red and green bunting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;14	Hundreds of soldiers and eight armored personnel carriers guarded the route on a national holiday when not all wanted to celebrated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;15	`` Out with Zedillo ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;16	and `` Zedillo No ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;17	more than 4,000 anti-government demonstrators shouted , some of them brandishing sticks and machetes , during a protest a mile away in downtown Mexico City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;18	The protesters , mostly farmers in straw sombreros , raised banners of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party , a vocal opponent of Mexico 's dominant rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;19	But police did not intervene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;20	U.S. Vice President Al Gore , one of 63 foreign dignitaries attending , said 1994 brought `` unprecedented progress in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico ... and we look forward to even greater improvement in the year ahead . '
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;21	Cuba 's Fidel Castro also was on hand along with most Latin American leaders , inspiring a protest by about 50 opponents of his Communist government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;22	Zedillo has promised to further the economic reforms of Salinas , who negotiated NAFTA , sold off hundreds of money-losing state businesses , and turned the economy around from an inflationary crisis of the 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;23	Zedillo , a former Mexicali shoeshine boy achieved a Yale doctorate in economics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;24	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , he was thrust into the campaign by the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , first choice of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;25	He won the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico , pledging to use the near-absolute powers of Mexico 's presidency to weaken his own office and give his own party greater independence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;26	`` As president I will not intervene in the affairs of the PRI , '' he said of his party , which has governed for 65 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;27	Zedillo also said he will give greater independence to the congress , the courts and local governments and end the practice of having the president handpick all top PRI candidates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;28	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under Salinas , signaled he would further free-market polices by his Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;29	Mexico 's leading negotiators of NAFTA were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0354;30	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;0	President Clinton on Thursday proposed spending dlrs 25 billion more for the military to help improve the readiness and working conditions of U.S. forces around the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;1	Flanked by the nation 's top military officers , Clinton announced support for the increase which would be spread over five years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;2	The proposal will be presented to the new Republican-controlled Congress next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;3	Republicans have promised to increase defense spending while cutting back on other programs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;4	`` I have pledged that throughout the life of this administration our military will remain the best trained , best equipped , the best fighting force on earth , '' Clinton said at the White House .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;5	`` We ask much of our military and we owe much to them , '' Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;6	The president disputed a suggestion that his request for additional Pentagon spending was an acknowledgement that he had cut too much last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;7	He said the request was because of unanticipated deployments to the Persian Gulf , Haiti and elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;8	The money would help cover a dlrs 40 billion shortfall over five years that had been created by a congressionally required pay raise , and by inflation , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;9	The move is also expected to help Clinton quell Republican charges that the administration has , through its budget cuts , hurt the nation 's defense posture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;10	Pentagon officials said it was unclear to them exactly where the administration hoped to glean the additional funds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;11	The announcement came just two weeks after the Army announced that due to operations in Rwanda , Haiti and elsewhere , had left three of the Army 's 12 divisions far below their peak readiness levels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;12	The new funds are expected to cover several initiatives that would also improve such things as housing and other quality-of-life programs , building on an recent announcement by Defense Secretary William Perry that more money would be put into such things , a second official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;13	Perry and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. John Shalikashvili , were to be present for the announcement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;14	`` This means that there will be more flying hours for pilots , more steaming hours for ships , '' which helps the force remain ready to conduct combat operations at a moment 's notice , a Pentagon official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;15	Officials said the announcement does not cover decisions about potential weapons program cuts that were being pondered by Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch , and that had been expected to be revealed this month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;16	Deutch had been looking at the potential for canceling , stretching out or cutting back 10 major weapons programs , including such things as the Air Force 's F-22 fighter jet , the Army 's Commance helicopter , the TSSAM Tri-service Standoff Attack Missile and the Marine 's AAAV Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0355;17	This year , the administration 's Pentagon 's fiscal 1995 budget amounted to dlrs 264 billion .

APW_ENG_19941201.0359;0	Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday the ministry 's central office and general staff will be trimmed , but not by 30 percent as reported earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;1	Grachev said the number of deputy defense ministers would be reduced , and several other areas of the ministry 's infrastrure would be reorganized , according to the Interfax news agency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;2	The cuts will take place in the near future , `` but not by 30 percent as the mass media reported earlier , '' Grachev was quoted as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;3	According to newspaper reports last week , President Boris Yeltsin has drafted a decree ordering deep cuts in the defense ministry 's central office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;4	The draft decree has received preliminary approval of the Cabinet and Yeltsin 's Security Council , the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported Tuesday , quoting well-informed sources .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;5	Yeltsin has already ordered cuts in the army rank and file .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;6	The army , which numbered 3.7 million men during the Cold War , is down to 1.9 million and is scheduled to gradually hit 1.5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0359;7	Grachev said the reductions in the central office will be carried out by uniting several departments of the Defense Ministry and other `` organizational rearrangements '' to prevent duplication of labor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;0	French petroleum group Total signed a three-year , dlrs 1 billion contract Thursday with China 's Sinochem on cross sales of petroleum and chemical products like resins , inks , adhesives and paints .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;1	Michel Chevet , Total 's representative in China , also stated that Total signed a frame contract to supply crude oil to Unipec , a joint subsidiary of Sinochem and Sinopec of China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;2	The supplies in 1995 will be 60,000 barrels per day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;3	Total meanwhile entered into a memorandum of understanding with the city of Dalian indicating its full backing for an oil terminal project in which Total will hold 24 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;4	The terminal will be able to receive crude oil from the Middle East and supply a nearby refinery in which Total has a 20 percent stake .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;5	It involves an overall investment of dlrs 100 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;6	Start-up is expected during 1995 , with Total to supply 50 percent of the crude oil requirements and receive 50 percent of the export products .
APW_ENG_19941201.0360;7	The joint venture involves Sinochem , the Ministry of Chemical Industry and two Chinese municipalities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0361;0	Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday the ministry 's central office and general staff will be trimmed , but not by 30 percent as reported earlier .

APW_ENG_19941201.0362;0	U.S. agricultural exports are expected to hit a record dlrs 45 billion in 1995 , an increase of dlrs 1.5 billion over this year , the U.S. Agriculture Department says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;1	If this estimate holds , the total would top the previous record of dlrs 43.8 billion in 1981 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;2	Although the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact is not cited as a cause , the world trade accord has been promoted as a boost to future U.S. agricultural exports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;3	A report by the House Ways and Means Committee said exports could be as much as dlrs 8.5 billion higher by the time GATT is fully implemented in 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;4	USDA estimates that agricultural imports for the upcoming year also will set a record , at dlrs 28 billion , up dlrs 1.6 billion from 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;5	That makes the projected agricultural trade surplus dlrs 17 billion for 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;6	Wheat and coarse grain exports are expected to rise 13 percent in volume .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;7	However , due to expected lower prices for corn , the overall value of grain exports is forecast to increase only 8 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;8	Prices for wheat are expected to stay strong through next year , according to the USDA forecast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;9	Soybean exports will also mark a gain in volume , up 28 percent from 1994 , although low prices again will hold down value , it says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0362;10	Other high-value products -- including fruit , vegetables , red meat and poultry -- also are seen making export gains in 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;0	A bid to salvage the near-bankrupt airline Iberia was stalled Thursday after overnight talks between management and the powerful pilots union ended in a stalemate over pay cuts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;1	Management and representatives of the carrier 's two main unions had reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a viability plan that entailed a wage freeze , salary cuts averaging 8.5 percent and a reduction of some 3,500 jobs through early retirements and pay-offs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;2	The viability plan is considered crucial if the European Commission is to consider allowing the Spanish government to grant Iberia a 130 billion peseta -LRB- dlrs 1 billion -RRB- capital injection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;3	However , a similar plan to bailout out Air France faces a court challenge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;4	Management of the state-owned company held talks Thursday with all of its unions -- except the pilots .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;5	The pilots union , meanwhile , said it would meet Friday with rank-and-file to evaluate the situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;6	It was not immediately clear whether the lack of an across-the-board agreement meant a much more drastic plan touted last week by Iberia -- involving 5,200 job cuts and the sale of company assets -- might be implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;7	That proposal triggered an one-day wildcat strike on Monday that paralyzed Spain 's airports and affected more than 100,000 travelers here and abroad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;8	The wildcat action apparently prompted unions to cancel a strike called several weeks ago for Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;9	Airline officials said flights would operate normally .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;10	Negotiations with the pilots reached a dead end as Iberia demanded a salary reduction of 15 percent based on 1992 earnings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;11	The pilots insisted that an existing wage agreement through 1995 must be implemented before the 15 percent salary cut could be enforced .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;12	`` The company has presented a generic plan that does not guarantee the future of Iberia and only concentrates on disproportionate salary cuts , '' said Armando Guajardo of the pilots union SEPLA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;13	`` Management has let the situation rot to such an extent so that it could enforce such a plan worked out in advance , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;14	SEPLA said the company needed a complete overhaul and not just a reduction in salaries and staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;15	He said SEPLA had sent a letter to Iberia warning of drastic action by the pilots if the current wage agreement was broken .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;16	Pilots represent some 5 percent of the 24,000-strong staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;17	Salas has warned that the company would be technically bankrupt by March 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;18	Iberia has posted losses since 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0363;19	It ended last year 67 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 530 million -RRB- in the red while losses for this year are expected to top 40 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 300 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;0	President Clinton pledged Thursday to seek a dlrs 25 billion increase in military spending over the next six years to improve the living conditions and readiness of U.S. troops around the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;1	Flanked by Defense Secretary William Perry and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Clinton also said he would ask Congress for an emergency increase in this year 's defense budget to pay for unanticipated military deployments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;2	The measures would be presented to the new Republican-controlled Congress next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;3	Republicans have called for increased defense spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;4	`` I have pledged that throughout the life of this administration our military will remain the best trained , best equipped , the best fighting force on earth , '' Clinton said at a White House announcement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;5	`` We ask much of our military and we owe much to them . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;6	Clinton disputed a suggestion that his request for additional Pentagon spending was an acknowledgement that he had cut too much last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;7	He said the request was mostly because of unanticipated deployments to the Persian Gulf , Haiti and elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;8	`` We have seen the military having to deal with an amazing variety of challenges , '' Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;9	Clinton did not say how much extra money he would request for the Pentagon this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;10	Without some increase , he said , the Pentagon would have to curtail training and find cuts elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;11	The dlrs 25 billion in additional spending beginning next year is designed to cover a projected dlrs 40 billion shortfall over five years that had been created by a congressionally required pay raise , and by inflation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;12	This fiscal year 's Pentagon 's budget was dlrs 264 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;13	Congressional Republicans have criticized Clinton for defense cuts they say have eroded military readiness , and the House Republican agenda proposes a dlrs 60 billion increase in defense spending .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;14	Clinton 's announcement was an effort to answer the criticism and counter the Republican budget proposal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;15	The president also seemed determined to answer Republican Sen. Jesse Helms ' recent suggestion that he was not fit to be commander in chief .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;16	In announcing his new spending initiative , Clinton rattled off a list of military actions he has ordered as president , including use of troops to help restore Haiti 's democracy and deployment of U.S. forces to Kuwait to counter an Iraqi troop buildup along the Iraq-Kuwait border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;17	`` Saddam Hussein got the message , '' Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;18	And in a holiday season reassurance to U.S. troops , Clinton guaranteed they will receive pay increases approved by Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;19	The amount of the increase is tied to inflation ; the last raise was about 2 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;20	Clinton said the increased spending next year and beyond would provide other `` quality of life '' improvements for U.S. forces and their families , including better housing , child care and family support services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;21	Clinton 's announcement came just two weeks after the Army announced that three of its 12 divisions had fallen below peak readiness levels because money that would have gone to training exercises had been diverted to pay for operations in Rwanda , Haiti and elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;22	Clinton said nothing about potential weapons program cuts being pondered by Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0364;23	Deutch has been looking at the potential for canceling , stretching out or cutting back 10 major weapons programs , including such things as the Air Force 's F-22 fighter jet , the Army 's Commance helicopter , the TSSAM Tri-service Standoff Attack Missile and the Marine 's AAAV Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;0	Serb fighters kidnapped more U.N. peacekeepers and pressed the stranglehold on the `` safe area '' of Bihac Thursday , underscoring their contempt for U.N. authority in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;1	The Bosnian Serbs did , however , agree to meet Yasushi Akashi , the top U.N. envoy , on Friday in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;2	They had refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday because he insisted talks be held in Sarajevo , capital of the internationally recognized government of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;3	They agreed to the Akashi meeting after Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , traveled to Pale for talks with Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;4	In addition to trying to calm the Bihac front , Rose is also concerned about the fate of more than 400 of his soldiers being held hostage by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;5	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said the latest kidnappings occurred Tuesday when Bosnian Serb units crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;6	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , and the United Nations has not heard from its troops since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;7	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , allowing for the unimpeded movement into Bosnia of equipment and personnel from Serb-held Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;8	Serb fighters from the two countries have joined forces in the Bihac offensive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;9	Rose 's talks in Pale were to have focused on Bihac and its demilitarization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;10	But there appeared to be no narrowing of differences that could end the siege .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;11	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the so-called Bosnian Serb assembly , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants , saying Serbs would accept only a permanent cease-fire , leading to a formal end of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;12	The Sarajevo government fears any permanent cease-fire agreement would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;13	An international peace plan , which the Bosnians have accepted and the Serbs rejected , would force Serbs to settle for 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;14	With new U.S. support for Europe 's position that diplomacy , not further NATO airstrikes , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian war , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his British counterpart , Douglas Hurd , planned to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;15	Milosevic is considered responsible for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;16	But he continues to wield the power , including with the Bosnian Serbs , with whom he allegedly broke ties last summer after they again rejected the international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;17	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs confederal links with Yugoslavia , a right the plan already gives Bosnian Croats with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;18	Critics say that is appeasement and a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;19	But Krajisnik said possible linkage with Yugoslavia was not as important as changing the proposed territorial maps , the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;20	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;21	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in the Bihac enclave , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;22	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;23	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;24	Between May and October , Serbs allowed only a dozen to pass through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;25	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were running increasingly short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;26	Heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire erupted around Bihac late Wednesday and early Thursday , along with heavy fighting southwest and south of the Bihac pocket , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;27	Two civilians were killed in Bihac Wednesday by gunfire , Ms. Tuffelli said , but overall the area was calmer Thursday morning with only sporadic shelling and small arms fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;28	Bosnian radio and Bihac regional officials painted a different picture by Thursday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;29	Radio said Serbs intensified their attacks later in the day on Bihac , Cazin and Velika Kladusa , all government-held towns in the Bihac enclave .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;30	Hamdija Kabiljagic , the regional mayor , also reported increased fighting along the perimeters of Bihac and shelling of the town itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;31	He accused the United Nations of deliberately downplaying the situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;32	There was no U.N. confirmation of the reported afternoon upsurge in fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;33	In downtown Sarajevo , Serbs targeted two government buildings with anti-tank missiles , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0365;34	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed , and the humanitarian airlift suspended , because Serbs had not given security guarantees and are able to threaten planes ' approach route with surface-to-air missiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0366;0	NATO on Thursday moved closer than ever to admitting its former Warsaw Pact adversaries into the alliance by ordering aides to set out the criteria for membership in the years ahead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0366;1	But , in an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev strongly criticized the alliance for going ahead with its plans for expansion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0366;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told grim-faced group of foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0366;3	The Russian had been invited to the allies ' meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0366;4	The special ties had been put together to try to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;0	Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the breakaway Chechnya republic , where leaders defied a Russian ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend their capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;1	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , and a Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;2	Meanwhile , residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;3	The city has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;4	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;5	Russia says it offers the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;6	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;7	President Boris Yeltsin threatened on Tuesday to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya if both sides did not surrender prisoners and stop fighting by Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;8	On Thursday evening , Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of the ultimatum saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;9	The reissued document skipped all reference to a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;10	Trying a different tack , Yeltsin offered limited amnesty Thursday to Chechens who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;11	`` The use of force in Chechnya is doomed to failure , '' said Sergei Yushenkov , head of the Russian parliament 's Defense Committee , who led the delegation to Grozny and met briefly with Dudayev , according to an aide in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;12	In another sign that Russia sought to avoid direct confrontation , Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that some Russian servicemen who `` carried out certain military tasks for material compensation '' from anti-Dudayev forces had been brought back to central Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;13	He said more would be evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;14	Grachev insisted such servicemen were volunteers who were not in Chechnya on Army orders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;15	Dudayev 's government captured up to 70 Russians in fighting last weekend and alleges that some were Army officers and soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;16	Chechen officials initially threatened to execute them ; Dudayev said Thursday they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;17	Despite Moscow 's softened tone , it still appeared to be beefing up troops on the borders of Chechnya , according to media reports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;18	Dudayev , who held a news conference in the basement of his presidential palace as jets roared overhead , remained defiant , calling Yeltsin 's government a `` satanic power . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;19	Looking tired under neon lights , Dudayev said his house had been bombed Thursday morning after the deadline on Yeltsin 's ultimatum passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;20	A small military air base near Grozny also was hit in an air raid Thursday and a woman 's corpse was seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;21	The ITAR-Tass news agency said two women were killed and fuel depots were burning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;22	Opposition air raids on the two previous days destroyed aircraft at military and civilian airports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;23	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;24	Elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;25	Grozny 's central bazaar , once thronged , was nearly empty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;26	Although life has gotten tougher and the economy is in shambles , many Chechens feel united in one thing : distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;27	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said a restaurant owner who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;28	Many Russians are content to let the Chechens go their own way , according to a poll Thursday by the International Opinion Research Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;29	The poll of 3,250 said 74.2 percent said Russia should recognize Chechnya 's independence , while 5.5 percent said it should n't and 20.3 said they could n't answer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0367;30	The firm said the poll 's margin of error was 1 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;0	Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the breakaway Chechnya republic , where leaders defied a Russian ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend their capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;1	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , and a Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;2	Meanwhile , residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;3	The city has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;4	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;5	Russia says it offers the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;6	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;7	President Boris Yeltsin threatened on Tuesday to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya if both sides did not surrender prisoners and stop fighting by Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0368;8	On Thursday evening , Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of the ultimatum saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0369;0	An 82-year-old man who guarded his garden shed with a shotgun was ordered Thursday to pay 3,633 pounds -LRB- dlrs 5,704 -RRB- to a burglar he wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;1	Six years ago Ted Newbury of Ilkeston , central England , fired a 12-gauge shotgun from about five feet -LRB- 1.5 m -RRB- away at Mark Revill , 27 , tearing a hole in his right arm and injuring his chest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;2	Doctors said Revill , 27 , can not straighten his fingers , had lost some feeling in his hand and still had pain in his chest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;3	`` To fire a gun when you have no idea who is there is a highly dangerous thing to do , '' Justice Richard Rougier told Newbury , a retired hospital porter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;4	`` To poke a shotgun through a hole and fire it with the knowledge that there are people outside constitutes negligence to the point of recklessness . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;5	The judge awarded a total of 12,100 pounds -LRB- dlrs 18,995 -RRB- to Revill , who had filed suit for compensation for his injuries , medical expenses and hardship finding work .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;6	But since Revill was found to be two-thirds at fault , Newbury was ordered to pay only 4,033 pounds -LRB- dlrs 6,332 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;7	But the judge also ordered Revill to pay 400 pounds -LRB- dlrs 628 -RRB- to Newbury for his shock and distress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;8	The judge noted that Newbury , who was fearful of burglars , had reinforced the shed with metal plates , padlocks and holes wide enough to fit his shotgun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;9	Newbury , who had been sleeping in the shed for four years , was awakened by Revill and another intruder in March 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;10	The judge said it was `` a shattering experience '' for Newbury to be awakened and hear one of the intruders say , `` If you are in there , you old bastard , we are having you . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;11	However , the judge added , `` Mr. Newbury has to face the obvious question as to why he did not scare off the intruders by some less drastic means .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;12	He could have switched on the light . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;13	Revill had been jailed for six months after pleading guilty to trespass and other offenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;14	Newbury had been acquitted of weapons offenses in a jury trial .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;15	`` I still ca n't understand what has happened .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;16	I will have to get an explanation from my solicitor -LRB- lawyer -RRB- , '' Newbury said Thursday after the hearing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0369;17	`` All I was trying to do was to protect my belongings . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;0	NATO asked Germany on Thursday to send fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia in a mission that would place the German military in a combat role for the first time since World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;1	Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said Germany must take on the mission but the foreign minister , Klaus Kinkel , raised doubts about it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;2	If Chancellor Helmut Kohl decides to accept , it could mean a bruising battle in the new parliament , where Kohl holds the narrowest of majorities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;3	The liberal opposition said it opposed any combat role in the Balkans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;4	Germany has shied from direct involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the history of Nazi atrocities in former Yugoslavia and anti-German sentiment among many Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;5	But Germany 's credibility in NATO could be threatened if it refuses the mission , given Kohl 's repeated assertions that his nation , seeking more international influence , must bear its share of peacekeeping responsibilities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;6	NATO requested German Tornado planes equipped with electronic gear that can locate and identify radar sites , and rockets designed to destroy such sites , a German defense official said , speaking on background .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;7	The Tornado planes could help prevent Serb attacks on NATO planes patrolling Bosnia to enforce the U.N. humanitarian mission and also could protect the air bridge to Sarajevo , the official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;8	The need for the specialized planes was highlighted last week , when supply flights to Sarajevo from Italy were broken off after Serbs fired missiles at two British Tornados .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;9	German officials could not confirm a report in the weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper that the request to Germany was made because Britain wanted to withdraw its fighters from the Bosnia mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;10	German acceptance of the mission could mean a greater say for Germany in NATO 's policy toward Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;11	German officials have ceded key decisions to nations like France and Britain , which have ground troops in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;12	In an interview distributed by the Defense Ministry , Ruehe said that if Germany turns down the mission , `` we lose the right to intelligently take part in the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;13	But ground troops are out of the question , Ruehe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;14	German soldiers would be `` part of the problem , not the solution '' because of the bitter memories over the hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews and others murdered by the German army and SS officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;15	The opposition Social Democrats said any German combat mission in Bosnia was unacceptable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;16	`` Every Serbian family mourns a victim of the Germans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;17	I have to ask whether it makes a difference if we 're on the ground or in the air , '' said Walter Kolbow , a defense expert for the party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;18	A July decision of Germany 's highest court gave the government the green light for the first time in the postwar era to engage in peacekeeping missions outside the NATO area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;19	But a majority of parliament must approve each mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0370;20	`` Whether we ... should really choose former Yugoslavia as the place to step up our engagement is something I believe we should consider very carefully , '' Foreign Minister Kinkel said in Brussels , Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;0	Here are excerpts of editorials from publications in various countries :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;1	Gulf Daily News , Manama , Bahrain , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;2	Bosnian Serbs were ... on the verge of military victory in Bihac -- and five major world powers seeking a peace settlement seem powerless to stop them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;3	The statement issued after ... French talks feebly demanded an immediate cease-fire -- and Washington , Moscow , Paris , London and Bonn are clinging to a facade of unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;4	Pledges to continue diplomatic efforts are now not enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;5	An ultimatum is needed followed by strong NATO intervention to save Bihac and prevent the resulting massacre .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;6	This could be preceded by an extension of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' around the town , using NATO air power to enforce it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;7	For this , European allies would need to plough in extra ground troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;8	Without such drastic action the Western alliance 's already discredited policy in Bosnia will completely collapse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;9	Jerusalem Post , Jerusalem , Israel , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;10	The new sniping between Europeans and the United States over the humiliation of the United Nations in Bosnia is a disturbing sign of how deeply this cancerous war has eaten into the monolithic Atlantic alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;11	What has also emerged from the fall of the Bihac `` safe area '' is that European states have been tilting steadily toward a Russian , rather than American , foreign policy perspective .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;12	This is a development which has implications far beyond the mess in what was once Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;13	The grand coalition of over 30 states that converged to liberate Kuwait from the grasp of -LRB- Iraq 's -RRB- Saddam Hussein now seems as far away as the Cold War itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;14	Le Figaro , Paris , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;15	The conflict in Bosnia has revealed the true state of relations between the United States and Europe in the area of defense .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;16	It 's no exaggeration to say the divergences are deep , for the basic reason that the U.S. administration does n't consider its strategic interests threatened by the torching of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;17	The Europeans , in contrast , fear that the rewards given to the aggressor will encourage him to pursue his policy of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Macedonia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;18	... It is high time to engage in a deep reflection on NATO , and that the Europeans and Americans become aware of the danger of this family quarrel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;19	Nihon Keizai Shinbun , Tokyo , on guns :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;20	Recent shooting incidents like the one in which a waitress was shot in the head in a restaurant robbery are on the rise in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;21	... What really points up the seriousness of the problem is that now it is n't just gangsters , but ordinary citizens who are being targeted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;22	What 's really terrifying about guns is that , compared with the powerful effort and will to kill required to murder with a knife or sword , there 's very little psychological deterrent for someone killing from a distance with a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;23	Serious discussion is needed to make sure that Japan , which was the safest country in the world , does not become a gun society like America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;24	The Australian , Sydney , Australia , on Japan 's `` comfort women '' :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;25	Japan 's rejection of the recommendation by the International Commission of Jurists that it should pay compensation to surviving `` comfort women '' forced into sexual slavery during World War II is regrettable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;26	It indicates a return to the attitude that predominated among Japan 's immediate postwar generations -- to disguise the past by contriving not to discuss it -- and represents a setback for the gradual attempts of recent years to reflect on the war through more open , honest and mature debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;27	The Geneva-based ICJ took 19 months to find that up to 200,000 women -- mainly from Korea but also from the Philippines , Taiwan and China -- were forced to work as prostitutes in military brothels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;28	However , the Japanese government rejected the report within 24 hours , saying it did not recognize the ICJ and would not be responding to its findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;29	If Japan is serious about properly mending its international relationships , and participating fully in the regional economy on any footing other than economic mastery , it needs to do more to acknowledge its wartime record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;30	Making due reparations to survivors of brutality in the occupied countries should be part of that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;31	The Financial Times , London , on the European Union :
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;32	In the hearts of Europe 's policy makers , hope springs eternal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;33	Faster-than-expected recovery from recession has revived the idea that a group of countries centered on Germany could attain economic and monetary union as early as 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;34	Yet there is an unfortunate corollary to the improved prospects for the European `` core . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;35	Economic divergences in the Continent 's periphery , particularly the European Union 's southern members , are increasing at a disconcerting pace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;36	Action to cope with the south 's economic challenges has been half-hearted or curbed by political difficulties or both .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;37	The south 's structural weaknesses can not be overcome without painful measures , particularly in reforming labor markets and welfare systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;38	... Yet without such restructuring , the task of adjustment will become still more difficult .
APW_ENG_19941201.0371;39	If growth migrates permanently from the south , the EU is unlikely to be robust enough to enlarge itself to the east .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;0	Bosnian Serbs detained more peacekeepers , denied resupply convoys and fired missiles at Sarajevo on Thursday in a further challenge to the United Nations ' crumbling bid to keep control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;1	A day after U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali 's failed peace mission , defenders and attacking Serbs also traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;2	U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia , that Bosnian Serb units had made an incursion across the border into Croatia and kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;3	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;4	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has not been able to make contact with its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;5	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;6	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs failed to react to 21 requests for convoy passage through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;7	He said food and fuel supplies for the United Nations were running increasingly short in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;8	Humanitarian convoys were also blocked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;9	In downtown Sarajevo , two buildings of the Interior Ministry were hit by one and three anti-tank missiles respectively , and four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;10	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed because Serbs denied flight clearance , ruling out any relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;11	Intransigence by both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;12	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;13	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;14	Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;15	Comments by the Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;16	He said Bihac would not fall , and that the Bosnian army eventually would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;17	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;18	Their leader , Radovan Karadzic , refused to come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali rejected entering Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;19	But the U.N. chief executive will be in Geneva Friday through Sunday to `` continue his intensive diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution , especially for a cease-fire '' in Bosnia , his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;20	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;21	Ivanko said later that Bosnian Serb forces kept the heat on the government 's hard-pressed 5th Corps , with significant fighting reported to the southwest and south of the Bihac pocket .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;22	But there was no immediate information on any changes in the frontlines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;23	Serbs are holding 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' consisting of Bihac town and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;24	One civilian was killed near the Bihac stadium by small-arms fire , while a number of shells exploded near the Bihac hospital , badly injuring one person , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;25	NATO ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday were to hear a proposal from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for a new international conference on former Yugoslavia at which the Serbs could make demands for new peace proposals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;26	Already , senior Western officials are proposing that the Bosnian Serbs be allowed links to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they long have desired .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;27	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;28	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0373;29	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;0	A rebel Serb assembly met Thursday in a session likely to endorse an economic agreement with Croatia despite two days of fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;1	Croatia 's army and Serbs lobbed artillery shells at each other most of Wednesday and Thursday , said U.N. spokesman Paul Risley .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;2	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confrontations since ending their 7-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;3	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;4	Artillery duels continued Thursday in the same locations close to Knin , Risley said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;5	Negotiations between the two sides have been stalled , but the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in this Croatian Serb stronghold approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;6	If accepted , it would be the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their seven-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;7	The draft agreement under discussion at the closed-door Knin meeting calls for restoration of water and electricity supply and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;8	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220-mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;9	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb Krajina region into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;10	Croatian Serb leaders rejected the economic accord two weeks ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;11	After meeting Milosevic , they dropped those objections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;12	But the session started amid fresh threats of possible new warfare between Croatia and rebel Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0374;13	Croatia is chafing at Serb control over one-third of its territory , and holds out the option of taking the territory back by force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;0	NATO asked Germany on Thursday to send fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia in a mission that would place the German military in a combat role for the first time since World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;1	Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said Germany must take on the mission but the foreign minister , Klaus Kinkel , raised doubts about it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;2	If Chancellor Helmut Kohl decides to accept , it could mean a bruising battle in the new parliament , where Kohl holds the narrowest of majorities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;3	The liberal opposition said it opposed any combat role in the Balkans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;4	Germany has shied from direct involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the history of Nazi atrocities in former Yugoslavia and anti-German sentiment among many Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;5	But Germany 's credibility in NATO could be threatened if it refuses the mission , given Kohl 's repeated assertions that his nation , seeking more international influence , must bear its share of peacekeeping responsibilities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;6	NATO requested German Tornado planes equipped with electronic gear that can locate and identify radar sites , and rockets designed to destroy such sites , a German defense official said , speaking on background .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;7	The Tornado planes could help prevent Serb attacks on NATO planes patrolling Bosnia to enforce the U.N. humanitarian mission and also could protect the air bridge to Sarajevo , the official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;8	The need for the specialized planes was highlighted last week , when supply flights to Sarajevo from Italy were broken off after Serbs fired missiles at two British Tornados .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;9	German officials could not confirm a report in the weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper that the request to Germany was made because Britain wanted to withdraw its fighters from the Bosnia mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;10	German acceptance of the mission could mean a greater say for Germany in NATO 's policy toward Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;11	German officials have ceded key decisions to nations like France and Britain , which have ground troops in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;12	In an interview distributed by the Defense Ministry , Ruehe said that if Germany turns down the mission , `` we lose the right to intelligently take part in the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;13	But ground troops are out of the question , Ruehe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;14	German soldiers would be `` part of the problem , not the solution '' because of the bitter memories over the hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews and others murdered by the German army and SS officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;15	The opposition Social Democrats said any German combat mission in Bosnia was unacceptable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;16	`` Every Serbian family mourns a victim of the Germans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;17	I have to ask whether it makes a difference if we 're on the ground or in the air , '' said Walter Kolbow , a defense expert for the party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;18	A July decision of Germany 's highest court gave the government the green light for the first time in the postwar era to engage in peacekeeping missions outside the NATO area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;19	But a majority of parliament must approve each mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0375;20	`` Whether we ... should really choose former Yugoslavia as the place to step up our engagement is something I believe we should consider very carefully , '' Foreign Minister Kinkel said in Brussels , Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;0	Al-Arab , Doha , Qatar , on the European Union :
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;1	`` The European Union 's steps to reinstate its own independent decision-making by rebuffing U.S.-diktat and shedding off the Israeli hegemony is laudable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;2	The newest evidence of this orientation is the opening by the EU of a new chapter of understanding with Syria by lifting the arms embargo imposed in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;3	The EU move would restore the Continent 's key Mideast role , which had dwindled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;4	The strong words by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on the European move unveils Israel 's intention to dictate its own version of the settlement conditions on Syria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;5	The lifting of the arms embargo on Syria caused serious dissatisfaction for the Israelis , who wanted to pressure Syria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;6	The German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , who is also the present EU chairman , should be praised for asserting that the statements of Peres are offending to the entire Europe , a key aid-donor to the Middle East peace process and the Palestinian national self-rule authority .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;7	Kinkel 's response is a strong-worded message to various sides , especially Israel and the United States . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;8	The Straight Times , Singapore , on Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;9	`` Who did Bosnia in ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;10	Who gave it to the Serbs ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;11	Who is responsible for the disgraceful surrender of the ` safe haven ' of Bihac ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;12	Who delivered the coup de grace ending an entire phase of contemporary Balkan history ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;13	The answer to each question can be found in the Byzantine corridors of power constituting the institution called the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;14	It is there that peacekeeping was allowed to descend into appeasement , a fiasco into a farce ...
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;15	However , a peacekeeping mission can hope to succeed only if its goals are clear and achievable , and if they are spelt out before troops are committed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;16	If they evolve in response to escalating stages of the conflict , then confusion , discord and deadlock are only to be expected ... '' ------
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;17	Der Bund , Bern , Switzerland , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;18	`` Symbol of Betrayal ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;19	`` Bihac : the U.N.-protected zone tormented by Karadzic 's Chetniks has become a further symbol of sadness of the Western failure in the Bosnian conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;20	Based on the conduct and positions of the international community , the assumption is that this protected zone wo n't be the last symbol of betrayal of a regligious community , which at best is suspect to Western countries and at worst is accused of fundamentalism .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;21	At the bitter end of a brutal tragedy logically stands the demise of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;22	`` Bihac : Under the hail of mortars from the Bosnian Serbs the Western concept of pacification of the Balkans through diplomatic means has collapsed like a house of cards -- a house of cards that was built from the beginning on illusions , on open and hidden partisanship favoring Serbia , an excessive regard for Yeltsin 's colossus with feet of clay ...
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;23	`` Bihac : the unimpeded invasion of the Serbs from Krajina and Bosnia into the protected zone confirmed the capitulation European diplomacy before the new destructive power that replaced communism -- ethno-nationalism . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;24	The Lyons Daily News , Lyons , Kansas , on GATT :
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;25	Three good reasons for supporting GATT are : Ross Perot , Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader , for a common opposition placing them among the strangest of bedfellows .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;26	In any other arena it would be a three-way dog fight ; but , that 's America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;27	The concerns are reminiscent of not so long ago when fear spread that rich Arabs were buying up America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;28	That fright lost its way when Japan went on a buying binge that stirred another round of foreboding predictions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;29	The vastness of America 's economy literally swallowed both , without a burp .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;30	There is a problem , but not with supposed intruders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;31	Rather , it is with certain narrowly-focused citizens blind to their own country 's presence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;32	If they are so insecure as to believe the Japanese or Arabs were going to tip the balance of greatness , then it stands to reason that GATT and WTO will stir anxiety .
APW_ENG_19941201.0376;33	For the majority of Americans , though , GATT holds more hope than despair , more promise than pain , tradeoffs that are well worth the investment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;0	Britain on Thursday announced its face-to-face showdown with the IRA 's political allies , at last confronting the difficult issues that imperil a budding peace in Northern Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;1	Peace talks next Wednesday between teams from Britain 's Northern Ireland Office and the Sinn Fein party will be the first formal , publicly acknowledged meeting between the two sides since the conflict over British rule of Northern Ireland ignited in 1969 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;2	The meeting will mark the transition from an at-a-distance `` peace process '' -- begun last December when the British and Irish governments offered Sinn Fein a place in talks if the IRA laid down its arms -- to deeply problematic negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;3	Prime Minister John Major 's private secretary , Roderic Lyne , informed Sinn Fein of the British decision in a fax to the party leader , Gerry Adams .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;4	`` The exploratory talks will be a vital step in the process of consolidating a lasting peace in Northern Ireland through a common commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and the democratic process , '' Lyne wrote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;5	Leading the Sinn Fein team will be Martin McGuinness , a former IRA commander who engaged Britain in secret contacts from 1990 to November 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;6	The outlawed group began an open-ended truce Sept. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;7	Leading the British side will be Quentin Thomas , a soft-spoken intellectual who has advised the government on political matters in Northern Ireland since 1988 but shied from the public eye .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;8	He has been a keen backer of the doctrine of denying Sinn Fein public contact in advance of a lasting IRA cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;9	`` Sinn Fein must be accorded the same equality of treatment and parity of esteem afforded all other political parties , '' said Adams , who next week will be in Washington to meet National Security Adviser Tony Lake and other U.S. officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;10	The peace talks are likely to take place at Stormont east of Belfast , the impressive setting for Northern Ireland 's Protestant-dominated parliament from the state 's foundation in 1921 to 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;11	Britain abolished the assembly because of its inability to draw Catholic support in the midst of the worst violence Northern Ireland had ever seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;12	Since then Britain has tried but failed to draw moderate Catholics into a reformed power-sharing government alongside Protestants , while shunning Sinn Fein and its working-class Catholic supporters because of the party 's IRA roots .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;13	The gap between Wednesday 's historic meeting and the creation of a round-table forum for Protestant politicians to sit down alongside Sinn Fein is wide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;14	The Rev. Ian Paisley , leader of the province 's hard-line Democratic Unionist Party , said it was wrong for Britain to talk with `` the men of blood . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;15	But the larger , more moderate pro-British party , the Ulster Unionists , said the time was right to test whether Sinn Fein had renounced IRA violence for good .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;16	`` We are now at the right stage to enter the next phase of this development , which is to establish if Sinn Fein really is to become a normal political party , '' said John Taylor , an Ulster Unionist lawmaker who survived an IRA assassination bid in 1972 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;17	`` They will have to learn that in the political arena , they have got to compromise , '' Taylor said , adding , `` We want to convert their cease-fire into real peace . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;18	British officials have indicated they will press Sinn Fein for a surrender of IRA arms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;19	For the first time , McGuinness said Thursday that the future of the IRA arsenal would be discussed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;20	Previously he has suggested that Sinn Fein could not discuss the handover of weapons and explosives -- most of them hidden in underground bunkers in the Irish Republic -- because Sinn Fein had no authority over the IRA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;21	But Sinn Fein sees `` demilitarization '' of all sides as the end result of a political settlement , not a precondition for negotiating one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0377;22	`` There is an awful lot of hard work ahead of us , '' McGuinness said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;0	But Kozyrev said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;1	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;2	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;3	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to draw in its one-time partners in the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;4	The Europeans in particular have been uneasy about pushing expansion for fear of upsetting Russia , still a formidable military power at the edge of allied territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;5	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;6	They had insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;7	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;8	A senior U.S. official , speaking a few hours before Kozyrev 's outburst , said , `` The Russians are undoubtedly ambivalent about this . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0378;9	He spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;0	Here are excerpts of editorials from publications in various countries :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;1	Gulf Daily News , Manama , Bahrain , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;2	Bosnian Serbs were ... on the verge of military victory in Bihac -- and five major world powers seeking a peace settlement seem powerless to stop them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;3	The statement issued after ... French talks feebly demanded an immediate cease-fire -- and Washington , Moscow , Paris , London and Bonn are clinging to a facade of unity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;4	Pledges to continue diplomatic efforts are now not enough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;5	An ultimatum is needed followed by strong NATO intervention to save Bihac and prevent the resulting massacre .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;6	This could be preceded by an extension of the U.N.-declared `` safe area '' around the town , using NATO air power to enforce it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;7	For this , European allies would need to plough in extra ground troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;8	Without such drastic action the Western alliance 's already discredited policy in Bosnia will completely collapse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;9	Jerusalem Post , Jerusalem , Israel , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;10	The new sniping between Europeans and the United States over the humiliation of the United Nations in Bosnia is a disturbing sign of how deeply this cancerous war has eaten into the monolithic Atlantic alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;11	What has also emerged from the fall of the Bihac `` safe area '' is that European states have been tilting steadily toward a Russian , rather than American , foreign policy perspective .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;12	This is a development which has implications far beyond the mess in what was once Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;13	The grand coalition of over 30 states that converged to liberate Kuwait from the grasp of -LRB- Iraq 's -RRB- Saddam Hussein now seems as far away as the Cold War itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;14	Le Figaro , Paris , on Bosnia :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;15	The conflict in Bosnia has revealed the true state of relations between the United States and Europe in the area of defense .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;16	It 's no exaggeration to say the divergences are deep , for the basic reason that the U.S. administration does n't consider its strategic interests threatened by the torching of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;17	The Europeans , in contrast , fear that the rewards given to the aggressor will encourage him to pursue his policy of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Macedonia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;18	... It is high time to engage in a deep reflection on NATO , and that the Europeans and Americans become aware of the danger of this family quarrel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;19	Nihon Keizai Shinbun , Tokyo , on guns :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;20	Recent shooting incidents like the one in which a waitress was shot in the head in a restaurant robbery are on the rise in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;21	... What really points up the seriousness of the problem is that now it is n't just gangsters , but ordinary citizens who are being targeted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;22	What 's really terrifying about guns is that , compared with the powerful effort and will to kill required to murder with a knife or sword , there 's very little psychological deterrent for someone killing from a distance with a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;23	Serious discussion is needed to make sure that Japan , which was the safest country in the world , does not become a gun society like America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;24	The Australian , Sydney , Australia , on Japan 's `` comfort women '' :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;25	Japan 's rejection of the recommendation by the International Commission of Jurists that it should pay compensation to surviving `` comfort women '' forced into sexual slavery during World War II is regrettable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;26	It indicates a return to the attitude that predominated among Japan 's immediate postwar generations -- to disguise the past by contriving not to discuss it -- and represents a setback for the gradual attempts of recent years to reflect on the war through more open , honest and mature debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;27	The Geneva-based ICJ took 19 months to find that up to 200,000 women -- mainly from Korea but also from the Philippines , Taiwan and China -- were forced to work as prostitutes in military brothels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;28	However , the Japanese government rejected the report within 24 hours , saying it did not recognize the ICJ and would not be responding to its findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;29	If Japan is serious about properly mending its international relationships , and participating fully in the regional economy on any footing other than economic mastery , it needs to do more to acknowledge its wartime record .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;30	Making due reparations to survivors of brutality in the occupied countries should be part of that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;31	The Financial Times , London , on the European Union :
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;32	In the hearts of Europe 's policy makers , hope springs eternal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;33	Faster-than-expected recovery from recession has revived the idea that a group of countries centered on Germany could attain economic and monetary union as early as 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;34	Yet there is an unfortunate corollary to the improved prospects for the European `` core . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;35	Economic divergences in the Continent 's periphery , particularly the European Union 's southern members , are increasing at a disconcerting pace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;36	Action to cope with the south 's economic challenges has been half-hearted or curbed by political difficulties or both .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;37	The south 's structural weaknesses can not be overcome without painful measures , particularly in reforming labor markets and welfare systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;38	... Yet without such restructuring , the task of adjustment will become still more difficult .
APW_ENG_19941201.0379;39	If growth migrates permanently from the south , the EU is unlikely to be robust enough to enlarge itself to the east .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;0	A rebel Serb assembly met Thursday in a session likely to endorse an economic agreement with Croatia despite two days of fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;1	Croatia 's army and Serbs lobbed artillery shells at each other most of Wednesday and Thursday , said U.N. spokesman Paul Risley .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;2	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confrontations since ending their 7-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;3	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;4	Artillery duels continued Thursday in the same locations close to Knin , Risley said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;5	Negotiations between the two sides have been stalled , but the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in this Croatian Serb stronghold approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;6	If accepted , it would be the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their seven-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;7	The draft agreement under discussion at the closed-door Knin meeting calls for restoration of water and electricity supply and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;8	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220-mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;9	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb Krajina region into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;10	Croatian Serb leaders rejected the economic accord two weeks ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;11	After meeting Milosevic , they dropped those objections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;12	But the session started amid fresh threats of possible new warfare between Croatia and rebel Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0380;13	Croatia is chafing at Serb control over one-third of its territory , and holds out the option of taking the territory back by force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;0	Under a furious lobbying barrage from the Clinton administration and a small army of corporate executives , the Senate stood on the verge Thursday of ratifying a sweeping expansion of global free trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;1	The climatic vote will not occur until the end of a second full day of debate , but supporters were claiming they now had an ample number of votes for the agreement itself and , more importantly , a small cushion for the three-fifths majority they need on a budget waiver .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;2	`` By the time the vote is actually taken tonight , we expect GATT will pass , '' said presidential press secretary Dee Dee Myers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;3	While administration officials and Senate supporters said their vote counts showed victory in their grasp , they did not let up in their lobbying efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;4	President Clinton met at the White House with a group of mostly undecided senators in an attempt to build the victory margin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;5	Sen. Kent Conrad , D-N.D. , said Bentsen told senators `` they will regret the vote the rest of their lives '' if they oppose GATT and that its defeat would have an `` adverse reaction '' in both the stock and bond markets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;6	Opponents , while conceding that the momentum was not going their way , did not let up in their efforts , either .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;7	A group of two-dozen protesters , one dressed as a lame-duck , chanted outside the White House as senators arrived for breakfast with Clinton .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;8	Sen. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina said that the new trade agreement was a bad deal that , by lowering trade barriers , would subject American workers to even more unfair competition from low-wage countries , further weakening the country 's economic standing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;9	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;10	Everybody knows that , '' said Hollings , whose home-state textile industry will be one of the biggest losers in the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;11	`` Wake up , Washington . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;12	However , GATT supporters said that the Senate 's choice on the last day of the 103rd Congress was between continuing to hold a position of economic leadership in the global economy or retreating behind protectionist barriers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;13	The House endorsed the accord , negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , by a 288-146 vote on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;14	Thirty-three other countries already have ratified the 124-nation accord and supporters said other countries are poised to act before Jan. 1 if the Senate follows the House .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;15	According to an Associated Press survey , GATT proponents appeared on the verge of victory , when counting those who were leaning in favor but not firmly committed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;16	The AP head count had 65 senators for or leaning for waiving budget rules , 28 against or leaning against and seven undeclared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;17	Opponents ' only hope was to change enough senators ' minds to muster 41 votes in favor of the procedural hurdle imposed by Sen. Robert Byrd .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;18	Under Senate rules , the implementing bill must offset all of the projected dlrs 43 billion in lost tariff revenues over the first decade of the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;19	To make up for the lost tariffs , the administration is cutting farm subsidies and raising revenue with a number of measures , including changing the minimum rate on savings bonds and auctioning licenses for a new generation of wireless broadcast services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;20	Byrd said the bill falls dlrs 14.5 billion short and some senators , while declaring themselves in favor of free trade , said they would not vote to bust the budget .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;21	Byrd and others also complain that a new Geneva-based World Trade Organization , created to referee trade disputes , will inevitably infringe on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;22	The administration is predicting 500,000 new American jobs as a result of increased U.S. export sales under GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0381;23	In addition to bringing foreign tariffs closer to U.S. levels , it reduces barriers to trade in agricultural goods and services and protects U.S. intellectual property , such as computer programs , from being pirated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;0	and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;1	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership cards and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;2	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;3	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;4	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;5	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;6	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;7	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;8	No list of front-runners for membership will be made ; no date set for the first admissions will be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;9	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;10	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;11	`` Not all countries will be able to obtain membership at the same time , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;12	`` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;13	Kozyrev 's criticism only added to the alliance 's troubles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;14	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;15	In an effort to heal the divisions , Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;16	That marks a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0383;17	With the policy turnaround , ministers agreed to relaunch diplomatic efforts to end the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;0	Bread price increased by 11 times Thursday as the government started implementing its ambitious market-reform plan aimed at freeing prices and slashing the deficit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;1	The government ordered bread price increased from 6 drams -LRB- 1.3 cents -RRB- to 66 drams -LRB- 15 cents -RRB- a kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;2	However , bread rationing remained in force with a daily norm of 350 grams -LRB- 12 ounces -RRB- per person in the capital , and 250 grams -LRB- 9 ounces -RRB- in the countryside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;3	Armenia is one of the poorest of the former Soviet republics with the average monthly salary at about dlrs 7 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;4	Its economy has been severely hit by an economic blockade imposed by Azerbaijan as part of a six-year war over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;5	Armenia 's only source of energy is a natural-gas pipeline from Georgia that has been repeatedly bombed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;6	The government has vowed to gradually deregulate all prices to meet requirements for international loans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;7	Armenia hopes to get dlrs 250-300 million in credits from the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and some Western governments over the next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;8	The authorities have said all prices would be freed until the fall of 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;9	On Thursday , the government also ordered a six-fold increase in the price of electricity , transport and communal services , and rent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;10	Other prices were expected to rise soon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;11	Officials have promised to ease the impact of price hikes by doubling wages and increasing aid to the poor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;12	The government has said its economic plan would result in cutting inflation from the current 8-9 percent a month to 1 percent by the end of next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;13	To ease the energy crunch , Armenia has also announced plans to build an oil refinery and is negotiating to get oil from Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0386;14	It also plans to reopen a nuclear power plant shut down after the December 1987 earthquake .
APW_ENG_19941201.0387;0	Key events in post-Soviet Russia 's struggle with Chechnya :

APW_ENG_19941201.0388;0	Bosnian Serbs detained more peacekeepers , denied resupply convoys and fired missiles at Sarajevo on Thursday in a further challenge to the United Nations ' crumbling bid to keep control .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;1	A day after U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali 's failed peace mission , defenders and attacking Serbs also traded heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire around embattled Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;2	U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Zagreb , Croatia , that Bosnian Serb units had made an incursion across the border into Croatia and kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;3	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;4	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , Ivanko said , and the United Nations has not been able to make contact with its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;5	More than 400 other U.N. soldiers are detained by the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;6	In Sarajevo , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Serbs failed to react to 21 requests for convoy passage through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;7	He said food and fuel supplies for the United Nations were running increasingly short in government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves and in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;8	Humanitarian convoys were also blocked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;9	In downtown Sarajevo , two buildings of the Interior Ministry were hit by one and three anti-tank missiles respectively , and four people were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;10	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed because Serbs denied flight clearance , ruling out any relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;11	Intransigence by both sides led Boutros-Ghali to suggest for the first time Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission might have to end .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;12	Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that his government would negotiate only after Serbs accepted a peace plan they repeatedly have rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;13	He reiterated his government 's offer of a three-month cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;14	Serbs want something more permanent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;15	Comments by the Bosnian army commander , Gen. Rasim Delic to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje underscored the government 's unwillingness to compromise further .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;16	He said Bihac would not fall , and that the Bosnian army eventually would win the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;17	Bosnian Serbs snubbed Boutros-Ghali altogether .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;18	Their leader , Radovan Karadzic , refused to come to the Sarajevo airport to meet him , and Boutros-Ghali rejected entering Serb-held territory for the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;19	But the U.N. chief executive will be in Geneva Friday through Sunday to `` continue his intensive diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution , especially for a cease-fire '' in Bosnia , his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;20	Maj. Herve Gourmelon , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , said heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire broke out around Bihac late Wednesday and in the predawn hours Thursday .

APW_ENG_19941201.0388;27	That would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;28	Bosnian Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0388;29	More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia .

APW_ENG_19941201.0391;0	An American collector paid more than dlrs 2.3 million Thursday for a `` lost '' manuscript by 19th century composer Robert Schumann , a record price for a music manuscript .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;1	The manuscript of Schumann 's second symphony , auctioned by Sotheby 's , contains a lost passage for the bassoon .

APW_ENG_19941201.0391;3	Some scholars had believed the manuscript , written in 1846-47 , destroyed during Allied bombing raids on Leipzig during World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;4	In fact , it was sold into private hands in 1950 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;5	Sotheby 's would not name the seller .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;6	The manuscript is so heavily marked with revisions and deletions that on some pages , new passages had been pasted over .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;7	One passage was lost that way , although Schumann said he favored it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;8	In an 1846 letter to Felix Mendelssohn , who conducted the symphony 's first performance in Hamburg , Schumann said he had a `` particular fondness '' for `` my melancholy bassoon in the Adagio . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;9	It was not known what he meant until recently , when the passage was discovered underneath a pasted-in revision in the manuscript .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;10	Schumann , who died in 1856 from what is today believed syphilis , discusses in the letter how the symphony reflected the state of his mind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;11	`` I wrote the symphony ... when I was still half-sick ; it seems to me that one must hear this in it , '' he wrote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;12	The previous record for a musical manuscript was set in 1989 for Schumann 's piano concerto in A Minor , which sold for 880,000 pounds -LRB- dlrs 1,382,000 -RRB- , Sotheby 's said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0391;13	The largest single price paid for a group of musical works was for manuscripts of nine Mozart symphonies , which brought in 2,350,000 pounds -LRB- dlrs 3,700,000 -RRB- in 1987 , it said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0393;1	Adobe Apparel Inc. made T-shirts , sweatshirts and dresses for companies like Russell Corp. , maker of the Russell Athletics brand .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;2	Tarleton said Wednesday he was lucky to have found a buyer for his Greenwood company in an industry he called `` a dying breed . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;3	`` I have spent the last five years trying to build a company , and in my opinion the government has destroyed the sewing machine industries by approving two things : NAFTA and GATT , '' he said , referring to the global General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement signed this year between the United States , Mexico and Canada .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;4	Most textile and apparel shops are n't expected to close their doors if the Senate approves the GATT on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;5	The House of Representatives passed the measure Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;6	Even healthy companies , such as Arkwright Mills in Spartanburg , expect the 124-nation trade pact to hurt , although they acknowledge parts of it could help the industry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;7	`` I think it 's about the best they could have done , '' said Earl Gowan , a payroll clerk at Arkwright for 53 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;8	Other workers interviewed Wednesday said they had faith that expanded trade would keep their jobs from heading overseas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;9	`` We really do n't know what 's going to happen , but we 're hoping it 's going to bring more jobs to the South , '' said Reba Rothrock , 65 , a 25-year veteran at Arkwright .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;10	The mill 's president and treasurer , MacFarland Cates , expects his family-owned company will have to fight off competition from the Far East , long a producer of inexpensive cloth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;11	GATT aims to lower tariffs worldwide , including those in the United States on imported cloth and on other foreign-made goods .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;12	It also would phase out quotas on imported textiles , another move expected to eliminate U.S. jobs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;13	Still , the agreement gives the industry a weapon it has wanted for years , making it illegal for garments assembled in China to be exported to the United States under the `` Made in Hong Kong '' label .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;14	For that reason , Cates and many others in the textile and apparel industries would like to see the treaty approved by this Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;15	They feel it would offer at least some protection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;16	`` I 'd love to see GATT killed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;17	But given the choice between this or a version without the rule of origin amendment , `` I 'd rather see them pass this now . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;18	Arkwright 's 300 workers make cloth used in sportswear , surgical towels , work gloves , even horse blankets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;19	Twenty years ago , foreign competition forced it to close two of its three mills and cut most of its 1,200 workers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;20	Those who are left now make twice as much cloth , and Cates says that efficiency will be the company 's key to survival .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;21	He hopes to expand by modernizing equipment and producing small orders that larger companies ignore .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;22	`` We 've tried to build in efficiency , quality and flexibility so we can jump around and fill different niches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0393;23	We think that maybe we 're in a better position to fight than some of the larger companies , '' Cates said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;0	Yasser Arafat 's government took control of tax collection and health care in the West Bank on Thursday , the latest step in transferring management of Palestinians ' day-to-day affairs to the PLO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;1	In recent months , the Palestine Liberation Organization , which runs the 6-month-old autonomy arrangement in the Gaza Strip and Jericho , has taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;2	Taxes and the health system complete the initial stage of self-rule , though Israeli troops still occupy all the West Bank except Jericho .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;3	The handover came amid mounting calls in Israel for barring Palestinians from Israel following a series of attacks claimed by Islamic militant groups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;4	Thirty-two Israelis have been killed since early October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;5	About 1,000 people gathered Thursday in the northern Israeli town of Afula for the funeral of the latest victim , Liat Gabai , a 19-year-old woman soldier who was axed to death on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;6	A suspect from the West Bank who was detained Wednesday told interrogators he was from the Islamic Resistance Movement , or Hamas , Israel radio said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;7	The same group claimed the bombing of a Tel Aviv bus that killed 22 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;8	`` I killed the soldier , '' Wahib Abu Rub said on Israel television , as he was led by police to a West Bank court Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;9	Police Minister Moshe Shahal responded by calling for a complete closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip once troops redeploy in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;10	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;11	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory ... until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;12	A closure could also lead to further violence by preventing thousands of Palestinian workers from entering Israel to earn a living .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;13	Palestinian and Israeli leaders have blamed economic troubles in the Gaza Strip for the growing support for Islamic radicals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;14	Despite the violence , talks between Israel and the PLO were expected to begin next week on the interim stage of autonomy -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;15	Israel is worried that the PLO can not guarantee the safety of the 120,000 Jewish settlers once the army pulls out of Palestinian towns as stipulated in their peace accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;16	There are calls to renegotiate the agreement , including a proposal Wednesday by Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin to skip the interim phase altogether and begin talks now on the final status of the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;17	The success of any Palestinian arrangement may hinge on its ability to extract revenue .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;18	Atef Alawneh , the Palestinian deputy finance minister , said he eventually hoped to raise dlrs 300 million to dlrs 400 million annually in taxes , much more than the sum raised by Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;19	During the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation , many Palestinians refused to pay taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;20	Israel retaliated by denying tax evaders documents such as drivers ' licenses and travel papers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0397;21	Alawneh said tax debts going back to the Israeli era would not be forgiven , and only fines and interest would be canceled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;0	A Bulgarian diplomat , a stockbroker , two rabbis and a Swiss couple were among 23 people accused of laundering more than dlrs 100 million in drug proceeds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;1	Carlo A. Boccia of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the defendants had a common motivation -- `` greed , a true example of how drug profits do corrupt at all levels of society . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;2	Boccia , special agent in charge of the New York office , said Wednesday that the defendants were part of a money laundering cell that enabled tens of millions of dollars to flow between major U.S. cities and Germany , Switzerland and Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;3	Boccia joined U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White , New York FBI head William A. Gavin and Police Commissioner William Bratton in condemning the alleged participation of otherwise respected professionals in the drug trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;4	`` Money became the narcotic , '' Gavin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;5	`` It shows the pervasive influence of drugs in our society . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;6	`` It is white-collar crime at its worst , '' White said , likening the defendants ' alleged deeds to those of street dealers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;7	`` The range of professions involved in this was surprising and somewhat depressing , '' said White , noting that a lawyer who was arrested practiced often at the federal courthouse in Manhattan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;8	A federal complaint charged 23 defendants with participating in a major international ring that laundered tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;9	Among the group was an assistant manager at Citibank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;10	The organization operated in New York , Los Angeles , Houston , Chicago and Miami in the United States as well as in Germany , Switzerland , Italy , Puerto Rico and Colombia , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;11	During the probe , investigators seized dlrs 5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;12	They arrested all but four of those named in a complaint , which was sealed until Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;13	According to court documents , the leaders of the organization in the United States were Richard Spence , a businessman who was formerly a New York City firefighter ; lawyer Harvey Weinig ; and Robert Hirsch , Weinig 's law partner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;14	Hirsch , 41 , has pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges in a plea bargain with prosecutors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;15	White charged that the three arranged for the pickup of narcotics proceeds from street corners and hotel rooms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;16	Also arrested were Leon Weinmann and his wife , Rachel , of Switzerland , who were lured to the United States for a meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;17	The complaint charged that the Zurich couple received cash and wire transfers and remitted them to bank accounts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;18	Swiss authorities have blocked about a half dozen accounts at several banks in Zurich at the request of U.S. officials in connection with the case , Zurich prosecutor Marc Ziegler said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;19	He said the authorities asked the banks , which he declined to name , to provide information on the accounts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;20	Among those allegedly sent as couriers were police Officer Michael T. Kalanz , firefighter Charles Bruno , hospital administrator Gary Salerno , Los Angeles-based stockbroker Donald J. Hayden and rabbis Alexander Schwartz and Menashe Leifer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;21	Also arrested was Latchezar Christov , an honorary consul general for the Republic of Bulgaria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0398;22	Those arrested were charged with conspiracy and money laundering .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;0	Russia on Thursday upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from a prepared speech to criticize the allies for ordering aides to draw up the terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;3	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;4	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0399;5	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;0	and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;1	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership cards and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;2	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;3	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;4	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;5	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;6	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;7	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;8	No list of front-runners for membership will be made ; no date set for the first admissions will be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;9	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;10	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;11	`` Not all countries will be able to obtain membership at the same time , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0400;12	`` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;0	Nordic navigation authorities agreed on stiffer rules Thursday that would require stronger hinges and better monitoring of cargo doors on ferries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;1	The rules , which still must be approved by maritime officials , were drafted in the wake of the Estonia ferry disaster , which sank Sept. 28 after its door locks failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;2	More than 900 people died .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;3	Insurance companies and ferry lines at the time acted quicked to weld shut the doors and visors on ships .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;4	But only the Finnish government issued a blanket order for weldings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;5	The navigation authorities from Sweden , Finland , Norway and Denmark , meeting in Helsinki , agreed on rules that would require hinges on all ferries to be reinforced or replaced , the Swedish news agency TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;6	Inspectors had found the weak point to be locks and hinges , rather than the plates that hold them , said Joakim Heimdahl , an official from the Nordic Sea Navigation Board .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;7	`` In many cases , one can see certain sections need replacing or reinforcing , '' Heimdahl said , referring to ship inspections in the past two months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;8	Shipping lines would have the option of upgrading the doors , or welding them shut permanently , Heimdahl said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;9	The rules would apply to all doors , whether hinged at the side or on top -- as was the Estonia 's front visor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;10	The rules also would require improved monitoring of the doors while the ship is underway , including closed-circuit cameras or other sensors , TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;11	Heimdahl conceded that the rules may mean `` sweeping , costly '' changes for older ships , apparently one reason why the decisions were not taken sooner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;12	Agreement by the navigation board was the first hurdle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0401;13	The proposals were referred to the Nordic Marine Safety Inspection Board , which meets Dec. 13 , TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;0	Nigerian superstriker Emmanuel Amunike smashed home his first Portuguese league goal Thursday to give Sporting a 1-0 triumph over cross-town arch-rivals Benfica .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;1	But the derby victory was not enough to catch FC Porto , still topping the league on wins and goal average after beating Amadora 1-0 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;2	Amunike , who donned Sporting 's green and white stripes this season after a controversial transfer from Cairo 's Zamalek was contested by Germany 's Duisburg and finally had to be confirmed by FIFA , scored 22 minutes into the second half .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;3	Charging down the center , he raced to catch a pass from Bulgarian Krassimir Balakov and slammed the ball low into the right hand corner of the goal as Benfica keeper Michel Preud ` homme took a dive to the left .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;4	Portuguese international midfielder Luis Figo got up from a tumble to score a second goal just minutes later only to see it disallowed as referee Antonio Marcal had already stopped play for a foul on Sporting 's Polish striker Andrzej Juskowiak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;5	Hard fought as ever , the derby in Sporting 's Alvalade stadium was a challenge for Marcal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;6	By the end of the match he had handed out 11 yellow cards and sent off two Benfica players -- Helder Cristovao and Nelo Guimaraes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;7	With the win , Sporting stayed level with FC Porto on 23 points at the top of the league .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;8	But the northerners still had the advantage in wins and goal average .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;9	Porto 's only goal came from international midfielder Carlos Secretario in the 22nd minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;10	He clipped the ball into the net as it sailed in from a cross by Russian Vassily Kulkov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;11	Marcelo Cipriano of first division newcomers Tirsense scored both his team 's goals to down Madeira 's Uniao 2-0 and overtake Sporting superstriker Andrzej Juskowiak to head the top scorer tables .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;12	Cipriano has a 10-goal tally , one ahead of the Pole Juskowiak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;13	Guimaraes continued to improve form with a surprise 3-2 win away to Madeirans Maritimo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;14	The islanders had been challenging Benfica for third place in the league .
APW_ENG_19941201.0402;15	But Thursday 's defeat saw them slip to sixth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;0	Governments must target bringing down rapidly increasing numbers of women with AIDS , discarding stereotypes that it 's mostly a gay men 's disease , according to politicians and activists at Thursday 's international AIDS summit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;1	Officials from 42 countries pledged to bolster the status of women and ensure their participation in drawing up and implementing AIDS policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;2	The deadly disease is spreading more rapidly among women , who suffer social , sexual and economic oppression , said Hiroshi Nakajima , director general of the World Health Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;3	WHO statistics show that three men for every two women become infected by the HIV virus that causes AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;4	But by the year 2000 , the rates will even out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;5	Although women are contracting HIV at a faster pace , most prevention methods still target men , U.S. Secretary of Health Donna Shalala said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;6	`` We must work together to reduce the vulnerability of women to HIV and AIDS by empowering them to protect themselves against infection -- both with and without reliance on their sexual partners , '' Shalala said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;7	The United States has doubled the amount of research money spent on microbe-killing vaginal creams or gels that are currently in the testing stage , Shalala said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;8	British physician Eileen Rubery said efforts have gained momentum over the last two years to develop a microbicide that women could apply before having sex .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;9	The cream has been tested in Thailand but caused itching and inflammation after frequent use , Rubery said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;10	It has been modified and is again being tested in hopes that a cheap , mass-market alternative to condoms will provide more women with protective choices against AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;11	Yolanda Simon , an AIDS sufferer from Trinidad , urged politicians around the world to increase care not just for women , but their families .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;12	American activists said the U.S. health program fails to take women 's family responsibilities into account , and that more women need to be involved in the administration of such programs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;13	But Phill Wilson , an AIDS victim from Los Angeles , said men should not be left out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;14	`` Women and AIDS is a co-gender issue .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;15	It 's a sexuality issue , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;16	`` It 's as much about homophobia and how gay men are forced to hide their sexuality from their -LRB- heterosexual -RRB- partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0403;17	Male education is needed because men are also responsible for having safe sex , Wilson said , especially in countries where women know little about protective measures or are unable to ask their partners to use them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0404;0	Leading goalscorers Thursday after 13th round play in the Portuguese first division soccer league :

APW_ENG_19941201.0405;0	Germany was asked by NATO on Thursday to send fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia , in a mission that could involve the German military in combat for the first time since World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;1	Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said Germany must accept the mission , but Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel raised doubts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;2	It will be a thorny decision for Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who has shied from involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the history of Nazi atrocities in former Yugoslavia and anti-German sentiment among Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;3	It will be a difficult request for Germany to turn down , however , because of Kohl 's repeated assertions that his nation , seeking more international influence , must bear its share of peacekeeping responsibilities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;4	Support was n't clear in parliament , which would probably have to approve any such mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;5	Lt. Col. Joe Cato , spokesman for NATO 's European military headquarters in Casteau , Belgium , said Germany has been asked to `` provide some combat aircraft to support NATO air operations over parts of former Yugoslavia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;6	NATO requested German Tornado planes equipped with electronic gear that can locate and identify radar sites and rockets designed to destroy such sites , a German defense official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;7	The Tornado planes could help prevent Serb attacks on NATO planes patrolling Bosnia to protect the U.N. humanitarian mission , and also could protect supply flights to Sarajevo , the official said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;8	The need for the specialized planes was highlighted last week , when supply flights to Sarajevo from Italy were called off after Serbs fired missiles at two British Tornados .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;9	German acceptance of the mission could mean a greater say for Germany in NATO policy toward Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;10	German officials have ceded key decisions to nations such as France and Britain , which have ground troops in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;11	If Germany turns down the mission , `` we lose the right to intelligently take part in the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina , '' Ruehe , the defense minister , said in comments distributed by the Defense Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;12	But ground troops are out of the question , Ruehe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;13	German soldiers would be `` part of the problem , not the solution , '' because of the bitter memories over the hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews and others murdered by the German army and SS officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;14	The opposition Social Democrats said any German combat mission in Bosnia was unacceptable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;15	`` Every Serbian family mourns a victim of the Germans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;16	I have to ask whether it makes a difference if we 're on the ground or in the air , '' said Walter Kolbow , a defense expert for the party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;17	A July decision of the German constitutional court enabled the government to engage in peacekeeping missions outside of NATO countries for the first time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;18	German supply troops were involved in missions in Somalia and Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941201.0405;19	`` Whether we , after the constitutional court ruling , should really choose former Yugoslavia as the place to step up our engagement , is something I believe we should consider very carefully , '' Kinkel , the foreign minister , said in Brussels , Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;0	Russia on Thursday upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from a prepared speech to criticize the allies for ordering aides to draw up the terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;3	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;4	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;5	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;6	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;7	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;8	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;9	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , sought to respond to Kozyrev 's remarks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;10	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;11	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;12	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;13	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;14	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;15	In an effort to heal the wounds , Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;16	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;17	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to draw in its one-time partners in the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;18	The Europeans in particular have been uneasy about pushing expansion for fear of upsetting Russia , still a formidable military power at the edge of allied territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;19	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;20	They had insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;21	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;22	A senior U.S. official , speaking a few hours before Kozyrev 's outburst , said , `` The Russians are undoubtedly ambivalent about this . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;23	He spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;24	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;25	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership cards and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;26	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;27	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;28	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;29	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;30	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;31	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;32	No list of front-runners for membership will be made ; no date set for the first admissions will be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;33	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;34	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;35	`` Not all countries will be able to obtain membership at the same time , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0407;36	`` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher confessed Thursday that the United States and its allies had mismanaged the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;1	He said they all had lessons to learn from the debacle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;2	As the NATO foreign ministers moved to expand NATO to countries in Central and Eastern Europe , Christopher found himself cast in the embarrassing role of explaining the Clinton administration 's decision to forgo force in favor of diplomacy to try to rein in the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;3	`` All of us ought to try to learn lessons from the experience in Bosnia , '' he told reporters , while trying to focus their attention on NATO 's future rather than the faltering attempt to quiet the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;4	Stoutly maintaining NATO had fulfilled the peacekeeping assignment given it by the United Nations , Christopher said the purpose in expanding the alliance and revamping the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , a 53-nation East-West group , was to forestall other threats to peace on the continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;5	A senior U.S. official put it more bluntly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;6	`` While Bosnia is burning we are trying to concentrate on the larger structural issues that may prevent other Bosnias , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;7	NATO 's projected expansion eastward would embrace the territory between Germany and Russia , where two world wars were fought in this century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;8	On Friday , Christopher intends to get formal approval from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;9	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;10	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;11	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made plans to fly to Belgrade next weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;12	Christopher 's aides said he did not intend to accompany them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;13	At the same time , NATO is considering contingency plans to withdraw the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in Bosnia , hundreds of whom have been detained by the onrushing Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;14	Christopher said an evacuation would require ground troops and the United States `` would have a role in that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;15	However , he said President Clinton had not decided specifically what American troops might do to extricate the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;16	Looking backward , Christopher faulted the United Nations for deciding in 1991-92 to deal with the conflict in Bosnia as a humanitarian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;17	`` NATO has done very well in what it was asked to do , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;18	And looking ahead , Christopher said the United States would not shrink from any new conflicts in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;19	`` We believe the United States should be involved in the resolution of such crises in the future , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;20	NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes defended the alliance he has just taken over .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;21	`` Before accepting a new peacekeeping mission coming from the United Nations or coming from the CSCE we will look very carefully to the conditions , to the roles of the game , before saying once again yes , '' the Belgian diplomat said at a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0408;22	At this juncture , `` on Bosnia we certainly are of one mind today , '' Claes insisted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;0	Evicted by police from government offices , hunger-striking leaders of East Germany 's reformed communists expanded protests on Thursday against a whopping tax levy they say would ruin them financially .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;1	Some 3,000 sympathizers held rallies and sit-ins in Berlin , Schwerin and Dresden on Thursday in support of the fast begun on Wednesday by Party of Democratic Socialism -LRB- PDS -RRB- lawmakers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;2	The party claims the government is trying to exact its political death with the 67 million mark -LRB- dlrs 43 million -RRB- bill , which was assessed by Berlin tax authorities based on real estate sales in the first half of 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;3	At the time , just months before German unification , the PDS as successor to the communists held vast assets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;4	A large portion of those assets are now controlled by an independent federal commission that is supposed to determine how much of the property they can keep and how much belongs to the people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;5	The PDS asked the commission to pay the tax bill , but it refused , saying it would be violating its legal mandate in doing so .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;6	A court ruled Thursday that the PDS would only have to pay 3 million marks -LRB- dlrs 1.8 million -RRB- security for the moment , pending further attempts to settle the dispute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;7	But party leaders said they would not pay .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;8	Leaders of other political parties accused the PDS , which was formed in 1990 out of the remnants of the collapsed East German Communist party , of trying to stir up public sympathy by falsely painting itself a victim .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;9	In Berlin , protesters gathered outside federal Interior Ministry offices to protest the police expulsion of PDS leaders from government offices on Wednesday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;10	They were also angered by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 's threat to charge the politicians with trespassing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;11	The PDS lawmakers moved to their party offices at the Berlin city legislature and said the hunger strike would continue indefinitely under the motto `` We wo n't be taxed out of existence -- No expropriation of the PDS . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;12	The party won 20 percent of the vote in eastern Germany in Oct. 16 national elections , thanks mainly to resentment among eastern Germans who feel they have been demoted to second-class status in united Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0409;13	Chancellor Helmut Kohl has attacked the PDS as a group of `` red-painted fascists , '' and the party has been battered by accusations that its parliamentary leader , Gregor Gysi , was an informant for the East German secret police when he acted as defense lawyer for dissidents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;0	Speakers and activists at a 42-nation summit on AIDS pleaded Thursday for compassion for homosexuals , drug users and prostitutes often shunned by politicians and the public .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;1	Governments should redouble their efforts to end discrimination against these groups , at high risk of becoming infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS , participants said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;2	`` All laws which deny the freedom of people to cross borders because of HIV must be abolished , '' said Richard Burzynski , an HIV sufferer with a Canada-based AIDS rights group , ICASO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;3	`` This means all laws which criminalize or discriminate against homosexuals , drug users , migrants and refugees , and sex workers must be abolished . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;4	Governments tend to ignore or isolate homosexuals , worsening rather than addressing the AIDS epidemic , the International Gay and Lesbian Association said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;5	Homosexuals must be accepted , educated and protected by legislation , the group said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;6	Officials of the 42 participating nations endorsed a declaration pledging to strengthen cooperation between developed and Third World countries and to fight discrimination against those suffering from AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;7	`` We are not meeting here simply to issue a further warning , but to declare a planetary emergency , '' said U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;8	`` Every day , AIDS kills children , destroys families , drains economies , threatens communities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;9	We must act without delays . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;10	The non-binding declaration says signatories will act to `` ensure that all persons living with HIV\/AIDS are able to realize the full and equal enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;11	The declaration promised efforts to provide health care , jobs , education and housing to people with HIV or AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;12	It also supported `` empowerment of women '' by raising their economic and social status and including them in decision-making .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;13	The summit was a focal point of World AIDS Day , observed around the world with education programs and fund-raising events .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;14	Australians attended special church services commemorating 3,500 compatriots killed by AIDS .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;15	In the Ivory Coast , where AIDS is the leading killer of young men , 2,000 people marched through Abidjan with banners declaring , `` Condoms for life ; AIDS for death . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;16	In South Africa , where the disease is spreading rapidly , health officials and politicians wrapped a huge red ribbon around St. George 's Cathedral in Cape Town as part of efforts to increase AIDS awareness .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;17	In Paris , hundreds of teen-agers visited a `` village '' set up across the Seine river from the Eiffel Tower , with scores of stands offering brochures , condoms and other educational material .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;18	A peaceful march led by the AIDS group Act Up through the Left Bank drew an estimated 4,500 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;19	Earlier , about 50 Act Up activists lay on the Champs Elysees and blocked traffic for several minutes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;20	At the summit , there were numerous calls for more AIDS spending , starting with Federico Mayor , head of the U.N. Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;21	`` In our budgets we have funds to pay the price of war , but we have made no provision for the cost of the fight against AIDS , '' Mayor said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;22	Funding `` must be accompanied by ethical surveillance to prevent or check any measures ... that would tend to exclude or discriminate against people who are ill from the disease , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;23	The World Bank , the biggest donor in the campaign against AIDS , pledged dlrs 150 million annually to combat the disease in developing countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;24	Britain announced an allocation of 230 million pounds -LRB- dlrs 358 million -RRB- on AIDS services for 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;25	Currently , however , more than 90 percent of the money pledged to fight AIDS goes toward helping only the 8 percent of those afflicted in developed countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;26	Some 17 million people are known to have been infected with the HIV virus , about two-thirds in Africa , the World Health Organization says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;27	Up to 40 million will have been infected by 2000 , and 10 million will have died , according to WHO , co-sponsor of the summit with the French government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;28	Some French media pronounced the summit a failure even before it began .
APW_ENG_19941201.0410;29	The daily Liberation criticized the final declaration as `` banal , '' predicted that little new funding would materialize , and noted that senior U.S. , British or German leaders rebuffed summit invitations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;0	Ernesto Zedillo , a mild-mannered economist whose rise to power capped a tragic and tumultous year of rebellion and political assassination , was sworn in Thursday as the 63rd president of Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;1	Taking the red , green and white sash of office , the 42-year-old economist promised to expand democracy and prosperity for this nation of 90 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;2	`` Our most important challenge is to provide dignified living conditions for every Mexican family , '' Zedillo said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;3	The new president also vowed to use the North American Free Trade Agreement `` to help generate the jobs we need and raise living standards . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;4	He spoke in the ornate Chamber of Deputies before 1,500 Mexican officials and foreign leaders , including Vice President Al Gore and Cuba 's President Fidel Castro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;5	Zedillo promised to start a war on poverty and maintain a cease-fire with Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;6	He said Mexico must unite to eradicate the poverty that led to the rebellion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;7	Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who negotiated NAFTA with the United States and Canada , was loudly applauded as Zedillo paid him tribute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;8	Outside the hall , military bands struck up waltzes and mariachi musicians warmed up a huge street fiesta on the parade route to the National Palace , festive in red and green bunting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;9	But not everyone wanted to celebrate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;10	`` Out with Zedillo ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;11	and `` Zedillo No ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;12	shouted more than 4,000 anti-government demonstrators , some brandishing sticks and machetes , at a protest in downtown Mexico City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;13	The protesters , mostly farmers in straw sombreros , raised banners of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party , the biggest opponent to 65 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;14	Zedillo , a former Mexicali shoeshine boy , received a doctorate in economics from Yale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;15	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , he was thrust into the campaign by the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , first choice of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;16	He won the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;17	Zedillo has pledged to use the near-absolute powers of Mexico 's presidency to weaken his own office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;18	He says he will give greater independence to the congress , the courts and local governments as well as the PRI itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;19	He says he will end the practice of having the president handpick all top PRI candidates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;20	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under Salinas , is sure to continue his predecessor 's free-market economic policies -- a commitment underlined by the Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;21	Leading negotiators of NAFTA -- the trade pact with the United States and Canada -- were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;22	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;23	Gore said 1994 was a year of `` unprecedented progress in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico ... and we look forward to even greater improvement in the year ahead . '
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;24	Zedillo also showed signs of a political opening with the appointment of a conservative opposition party member , Antonio Lozano , as attorney general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;25	The post is crucial for Zedillo , who made fighting government corruption a major part of his campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;26	Last week , a deputy attorney general investigating the Sept. 28 assassination of his own brother , a top PRI official , resigned angrily , charging that top government and party officials were involved in a cover-up .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;27	Lozano 's appointment marks the first time a Cabinet post has been given to an opposition party member , and it `` opens the possibility of an important change , '' said Carlos Castillo Pedraza , the president of the National Action Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;28	On Tuesday , Zedillo reached out to the left as well , meeting with leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party and promising reforms to help make Mexico more democratic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;29	Salinas never met publicly with leaders of that main leftist opposition during his administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;30	The party apparently responded by pulling some 4,000 protesters out of the capital 's main plaza Wednesday , indicating an effort to avoid the confrontations that marred Salinas ' inauguration in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;31	The demonstrators were protesting alleged vote fraud in recent state elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;32	Despite Zedillo 's moves , other discontent remains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;33	A protest was planned Thursday by leftist supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels of southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0411;34	That rebellion , stalled since January by a cease-fire , is one of the toughest problems facing the new president .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;0	Sunburned and scattered on an improvised armada of U.S. Navy ships and cargo boats in the Indian Ocean , the nearly 1,000 survivors of a blaze that swept through the Achille Lauro began the first leg Thursday of their return home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;1	The fire broke out Wednesday morning in the engine room on the bad luck cruise ship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;2	The Achille Lauro was hijacked in 1985 and an American passenger killed by Palestinian terrorists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;3	Passengers and crew who escaped the blaze by scrambling into lifeboats were transferred Thursday to 10 ships that would take them to Kenya or Djibouti .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;4	Many of the survivors , some dressed in evening or bed clothes , had spent hours aboard the deck of the oil tanker Hawaiian King and other merchant ships that had plucked them to safety immediately after the evacuation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;5	Two elderly passengers died -- an Englishman during the evacuation and a German man of a heart attack .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;6	Eight people were injured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;7	Starlauro , the Achille Lauro 's owners , said in Naples they were trying to determine if the German died because of the fire or if he had the attack before the early-morning blaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;8	`` The fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down toward the cabins , '' one survivor , Tony Webb , was quoted as telling the London Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;9	Webb , a 44-year-old Briton who now lives in Cape Town , South Africa , had taken his wife and 2-year-old son on the cruise after winning a contest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;10	He said he was still wearing his dinner jacket after a ship dance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;11	`` People were in their evening suits and dressing gowns , '' the paper quoted Webb as saying .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;12	Children screamed and people clung to each other as the Achille Lauro listed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;13	With his son Michael holding on to him in terror Webb looked back and saw flames `` leaping up and there was smoke all around . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;14	'' The crew was wonderful , '' Webb said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;15	`` They tried to keep us all calm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;16	At about 8 a.m. , the captain said the fire was too strong and we would have to abandon the ship . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;17	Starlauro , the cruise ship 's owners , said an SOS was sent at just before 7 a.m. local time .

APW_ENG_19941201.0412;21	He later said the fire began in the engine room and crews struggled to contain the blaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;22	`` But then a piston exploded and the flames spread all over the place , '' said Orsi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;23	`` From what I saw -LRB- the ship -RRB- is gone , '' he said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0412;26	They were offered '' a hot shower , the crew were feeding them ... -LRB- and -RRB- donating clothes for them to wear , as a lot abandoned ship in nightclothes . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;27	Many had bad sunburn after being exposed for hours on the deck of the Hawaiian King , Navy officials reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;28	By Thursday evening , survivors were spread aboard a total of 10 ships .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;29	Five vessels were headed for Djibouti , on the Horn of Africa ; and five for Mombasa , Kenya , with the first due , the Liberian-registered Bar Du , in Djibouti , at 2 p.m. local time -LRB- 1100 gmt -RRB- , the Italian Coast Guard reported Thursday evening .

APW_ENG_19941201.0412;32	Most of the crew was Italian , and the passengers mainly South African , German , Dutch or British .

APW_ENG_19941201.0412;35	The ship had been bound for South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;36	The Italian liner itself Thursday still hung on , although listing badly to port .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;37	White steam and gray smoke poured out of port side and smaller plumes of smoke drifted out of the lower starboard deck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;38	Tug boats arrived at the ship Thursday to possibly tow it to port , Italian media reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;39	The pilot of a plane carrying Associated Press cameramen and a reporter put the ship 's position at 160 miles east of the small Somali fishing village of Eil .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;40	Heat and soot blackened the Achille Lauro 's two smokestacks , and its blue-and-white paint was scorched and mottled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;41	The ship 's captain reportedly has put the fire 's origin in the engine room , apparently contradicting the company 's initial assertion that the blaze began in the passenger area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;42	Starlauro 's director-general , Franco Zuccherino , told RAI TV Thursday that the fire 's dynamics were yet to be determined .
APW_ENG_19941201.0412;43	`` We have to talk extensively with the captain '' first , Zuccherino said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0414;0	Bread prices increased 11 times Thursday as the government started implementing a market-reform plan aimed at freeing prices and slashing the deficit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;1	The government ordered bread prices increased from 6 drams -LRB- 1.3 cents -RRB- to 66 drams -LRB- 15 cents -RRB- per kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;2	But bread rationing remained in force , with a daily norm of 350 grams -LRB- 12 ounces -RRB- per person in the capital and 250 grams -LRB- 9 ounces -RRB- in the countryside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;3	Armenia is one of the poorest of the former Soviet republics , with an average monthly salary of about dlrs 7 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0414;6	The government has vowed to gradually deregulate prices to meet requirements for international loans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;7	Armenia hopes to get dlrs 250 million to dlrs 300 million in credits from the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and some Western governments over the next year .

APW_ENG_19941201.0414;9	On Thursday , the government also ordered a six-fold increase in electricity rates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;10	Prices for transport , rent and other prices were expected to rise soon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;11	Officials have promised to ease the impact of price hikes by doubling wages and increasing aid to the poor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0414;12	The government has said its economic plan will result in cutting inflation from the current 8 percent to 9 percent a month to just 1 percent by the end of next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0415;0	Bread prices increased 11 times Thursday as the government started implementing a market-reform plan aimed at freeing prices and slashing the deficit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0415;1	The government ordered bread prices increased from 6 drams -LRB- 1.3 cents -RRB- to 66 drams -LRB- 15 cents -RRB- per kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- .

APW_ENG_19941201.0416;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher confessed Thursday that the United States and its allies had mismanaged the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;1	He said they all have lessons to learn from the debacle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;2	As the NATO foreign ministers moved to expand NATO to countries in Central and Eastern Europe , Christopher found himself cast in the embarrassing role of explaining the Clinton administration 's decision to forgo force in favor of diplomacy to try to rein in the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;3	`` All of us ought to try to learn lessons from the experience in Bosnia , '' he told reporters , while trying to focus attention on NATO 's future rather than the faltering attempt to quiet the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;4	Stoutly maintaining NATO had fulfilled the peacekeeping assignment given it by the United Nations , Christopher said the purpose in expanding the alliance and revamping the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , a 53-nation East-West group , was to forestall other threats to peace on the continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;5	A senior U.S. official put it more bluntly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;6	`` While Bosnia is burning we are trying to concentrate on the larger structural issues that may prevent other Bosnias , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;7	NATO 's projected expansion eastward would embrace the territory between Germany and Russia , where two world wars were fought in this century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;8	On Friday , Christopher intends to get formal approval from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;9	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;10	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;11	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made plans to fly to Belgrade next weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;12	Christopher 's aides said he did not intend to accompany them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;13	At the same time , NATO is considering contingency plans to withdraw the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in Bosnia , hundreds of whom have been detained by the onrushing Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;14	Christopher said an evacuation would require ground troops and the United States `` would have a role in that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;15	However , he said President Clinton had not decided specifically what American troops might do to extricate the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;16	Looking backward , Christopher faulted the United Nations for deciding in 1991-92 to deal with the conflict in Bosnia as a humanitarian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;17	`` NATO has done very well in what it was asked to do , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;18	And looking ahead , Christopher said the United States would not shrink from any new conflicts in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0416;19	`` We believe the United States should be involved in the resolution of such crises in the future , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;0	Holding 55 Canadian peacekeepers hostage in Bosnia is unacceptable and little progress is being made to win their release , Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;1	Still , it was not a mistake for Canada to renew its six-month commitment to UN peacekeeping in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic , the prime minister said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;2	The current mandate runs out at the end of March .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;3	`` I do n't think that it 's a mistake when our country is doing something for peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;4	It might be difficult , it might be complicated , it might be dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;5	`` But I have to tell you that the Canadians have a great reputation not to be afraid to do something for peace . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;6	Earlier in a speech to the French Senate , Chretien said NATO allies will try to solve the crisis in talks in Budapest next week with former Soviet bloc countries at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;7	The talks will look for a way `` to master this destructive spirit rooted in intolerance , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;8	Chretien is only the second foreign leader ever invited to speak to the French Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;9	He took advantage of the opportunity to send a discreet message to the French that Canada is a bilingual country that works .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;10	`` The French language continues to flourish in Canada and a multitude of Canadians are adopting it as their second language , '' Chretien said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;11	But the prime minister 's remarks -- which did not refer once to the forthcoming Quebec referendum on separation -- were overshadowed by concerns about UN peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;12	After his speech , Chretien said it was not acceptable that Bosnian Serbs , who are detaining some 400 peacekeepers , refused to meet UN Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali when he visited the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;13	The prime minister also did n't quarrel with calling the detained troops hostages .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;14	`` They are detained , you can call it hostages ... But I would not fight on the meaning of words here . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;15	The prime minister hopes the peacekeepers will be released soon , but `` we 're not making progress at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;16	Speaking in the ornate Senate chamber , Chretien downplayed national unity in favor of expanding world trade and stressing the importance of Canada-France relations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;17	He suggested it 's time to consider a free trade agreement between the North American trading bloc -- Canada , the United States and Mexico -- and the European Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;18	Chretien also promised a more modest summit when the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies meet next June in Halifax .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;19	Such meetings are sometimes criticized as expensive photo opportunities which accomplish little .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;20	La Francophonie , a group of the world 's French-speaking countries , could also get more involved in politics , Chretien said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;21	He noted the organization did little to avert a bloodbath in Rwanda and a military coup in Haiti , both member countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;22	While avoiding any direct references to Canadian unity , the prime minister still sent a subtle but powerful message to Quebec separatists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;23	Quebec politicians have also been wooing the French in the pre-referendum period -- Premier Jacques Parizeau visits in January , International Affairs Minister Bernard Landry was there last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;24	But Chretien said three times in his speech that Canada and France share a common cause , referring to peacekeeping , world organizations and trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;25	Asked later why he did n't mention the referendum that Parizeau has promised to hold next year , Chretien said : `` I do n't think it was appropriate for me to come and , you know , wash our linen here . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;26	German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the first foreign leader to speak to the French Senate and Russian President Boris Yeltsin is expected to be the next .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;27	Rene Monory , president of the Senate , sidestepped a question about whether Parizeau will get a similar invitation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;28	`` It 's the office that has decided the invitation of Mr. Chretien , because I know he is the prime minister of the country , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;29	Earlier Thursday , Chretien told a conference on AIDS that `` as AIDS continues to ravage every corner of the world , there can be no doubt that we must all work even harder and more urgently . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;30	But he announced little new action , saying Canada would maintain and possibly increase its efforts in Africa against the disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0417;31	Most of Canada 's $ 11 million international financial assistance concerning AIDS is already directed towards Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;0	Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the breakaway republic of Chechnya , where leaders defied a Russian ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend their capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;1	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , and a Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;2	Residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;3	The city has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;4	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;5	Russia says it has given the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;6	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;7	President Boris Yeltsin threatened Tuesday to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya if both sides did not surrender prisoners and stop fighting by Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;8	On Thursday evening , Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of the ultimatum , saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;9	The reissued document made no reference to a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;10	Trying a different tack , Yeltsin offered limited amnesty Thursday to Chechens who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;11	In another sign of Russia 's desire to avoid direct confrontation , Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that some Russian soldiers who `` carried out certain military tasks for material compensation '' from anti-Dudayev forces had been brought back to central Russia , and more would be evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;12	Grachev insisted the soldiers were volunteers and were not in Chechnya on army orders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;13	Dudayev 's government captured up to 70 Russians in fighting last weekend and alleged that some were army officers and soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;14	Chechen officials initially threatened to execute them , but Dudayev said Thursday they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;15	Despite Moscow 's softened tone , it still appeared to be beefing up troops on the borders of Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;16	A tired-looking Dudayev held a defiant news conference in the basement of his presidential palace as jets roared overhead , calling Yeltsin 's government a `` satanic power . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;17	Dudayev said his house had been bombed Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;18	A small military air base near Grozny also was hit in an air raid Thursday and a woman 's corpse was seen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;19	The ITAR-Tass news agency said two women were killed and fuel depots were burning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;20	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0418;21	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;0	A United Nations protest to Bosnian Serbs for detaining peacekeepers and attacking a Canadian camp sparked a response from the Serb 's top general , a Canadian military spokesperson said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;1	Maj. Rita LePage , Canadian military spokesperson in Zagreb , Croatia , said Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;2	Bertrand Guillaume de Lapresle , UN commander in former Yugoslavia , and his deputy commander , Canadian Maj.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;3	Raymond Crabbe , received two letters from the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;4	The letters came from Gen. Ratko Mladic , Serb army commander , and one of his assistants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;5	Earlier this week , Lapresle and Crabbe had themselves sent letters to the Serbs protesting the holding of UN troops and a Serb rocket attack on the Canadian peacekeeping camp in Visoko on Sunday , which damaged a building .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;6	Canadian officials declined to comment on the letters ' contents saying the Serb letters came at a `` sensitive '' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;7	But military sources said the response was too general to satisfy UN leaders as they try to restart serious talks on releasing 400 UN troops , including 55 Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;8	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , in Paris Thursday for a world conference on AIDS , said the hostage situation is unacceptable but little progress is being made to win their release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;9	`` They are detained , you can call it hostages ... But I would not fight on the meaning of words here . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;10	Earlier , in a speech to the French Senate , Chretien said NATO allies will try to solve the crisis in talks in Budapest next week with former Soviet bloc countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;11	Meanwhile , UN officials Thursday were trying to schedule high-level talks near Sarajevo on releasing UN soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;12	Lapresle and Yasushi Akashi , the top UN civilian in Bosnia , hope to meet today with Mladic and Radovan Karadzic , political leader of Bosnia 's Serbs , at the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;13	Hopes for the soldiers ' release were dampened Thursday when Bosnian Serb forces crossed into Croatia , kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers and took them to Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;14	The UN mission was put under further pressure as Serbs blocked food convoys , fired missiles at Sarajevo and traded fire with government troops around Bihac , a Muslim area in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;15	The 55 Canadians have been held for a week at observation points and other locations near their camp in Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;16	A camp supply vehicle reached the Canadians on Wednesday night with books , mail and personal items .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;17	Life at the Canadian peacekeepers ' camp gradually returned to normal Thursday , a day after a Serb threat to shell the camp again passed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;18	But the camp stayed at the high alert level of orange Thursday , which requires personnel to wear flak jackets and helmets when outside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;19	In Brussels , NATO foreign ministers gathered Thursday to seek terms for a new Bosnian ceasefire , as western allies argued over the how NATO and the UN should handle the bloody Balkan war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;20	Officials in Bonn confirmed that NATO had asked Germany to contribute fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;21	The controversial move would put Germany 's military in its first combat role in 49 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0419;22	Chancellor Helmut Kohl was likely to intervene personally in any decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher confessed Thursday that the United States and its allies had mismanaged the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;1	He said they all have lessons to learn from the debacle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;2	As the NATO foreign ministers moved to expand NATO to countries in Central and Eastern Europe , Christopher found himself cast in the embarrassing role of explaining the Clinton administration 's decision to forgo force in favor of diplomacy to try to rein in the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;3	`` All of us ought to try to learn lessons from the experience in Bosnia , '' he told reporters , while trying to focus attention on NATO 's future rather than the faltering attempt to quiet the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;4	Stoutly maintaining NATO had fulfilled the peacekeeping assignment given it by the United Nations , Christopher said the purpose in expanding the alliance and revamping the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , a 53-nation East-West group , was to forestall other threats to peace on the continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;5	A senior U.S. official put it more bluntly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;6	`` While Bosnia is burning we are trying to concentrate on the larger structural issues that may prevent other Bosnias , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;7	NATO 's projected expansion eastward would embrace the territory between Germany and Russia , where two world wars were fought in this century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;8	On Friday , Christopher intends to get formal approval from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;9	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;10	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;11	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made plans to fly to Belgrade next weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;12	Christopher 's aides said he did not intend to accompany them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;13	At the same time , NATO is considering contingency plans to withdraw the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in Bosnia , hundreds of whom have been detained by the onrushing Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;14	Christopher said an evacuation would require ground troops and the United States `` would have a role in that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;15	However , he said President Clinton had not decided specifically what American troops might do to extricate the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;16	Looking backward , Christopher faulted the United Nations for deciding in 1991-92 to deal with the conflict in Bosnia as a humanitarian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;17	`` NATO has done very well in what it was asked to do , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;18	And looking ahead , Christopher said the United States would not shrink from any new conflicts in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0420;19	`` We believe the United States should be involved in the resolution of such crises in the future , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;0	Canadian peacekeepers serving with the United Nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina are detained by Bosnian Serbs after NATO planes bomb Serb positions in Bosnia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;1	Here are some key dates surrounding the detention :
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;2	Nov. 19 -- UN Security Council extends NATO air authority to Croatia after Serb warplanes flying from an air base in Udbina , in Serb-controlled Croatia , launch air strikes on the UN-declared safe haven of Bihac in northwest Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941201.0429;8	Nov. 25 -- NATO jets fly over Serb positions near Bihac but due to darkness drop no bombs as Serb forces advance into the enclave , controlled by the Muslim-led government army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;9	Serbs allow some of the detained Canadians to carry out work at their observation posts .

APW_ENG_19941201.0429;20	Nov. 30 -- a Bosnian Serb threat to shell the Canadian camp within 48 hours passes without incident .
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;21	However , the peacekeepers increase security and place sandbags around sleeping quarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0429;22	Dec. 1 -- Bosnian Serbs respond to letters from Canadian and UN commanders protesting the detention of 55 Canadian peacekeepers , but military sources say the response was too general to satisfy the UN as it tries to restart serious talks on releasing 400 UN troops , including the Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;0	The government complained to the Spanish ambassador Thursday about `` intrusive '' checks on Gibraltar citizens entering Spain .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;1	The intensity of car and body searches by Spanish border police reportedly can cause delays of several hours .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;2	David Davis , the Foreign Office minister for Europe , called in Spanish ambassador Alberto Aza Arias , according to a Foreign Office statement that described the checks as having `` seriously interfered with cross-border traffic and daily life in Gibraltar . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;3	Davis told Arias `` the checks were intrusive and could not seriously be presented as a search for drugs and tobacco , '' the statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;4	`` Mr. Davis warned the checks could damage prospects for practical cooperation between the Gibraltar and Spanish authorities in a number of important areas of mutual concern , '' the Foreign Office statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;5	Spain claims sovereignty over the 5.8-square-kilometer -LRB- 2.25-square-mile -RRB- territory of limestone rock at the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;6	Gibraltar 's approximately 30,000 residents want continued allegiance to Britain , which since 1704 has held the strategic territory overlooking the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;7	Britain 's determination to retain Gibraltar has proved a chronic sore point in British-Spanish relations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0430;8	British-Spanish talks on Gibraltar 's future have been stalled since 1989 over the issue of who should control its airport .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;0	Amnesty International accused the upcoming Summit of the Americas Thursday of paying too little attention to punishing human rights abuses in the hemisphere .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;1	The human rights group also challenged the idea that trade and democracy alone can bring about respect for human rights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;2	Despite the advent of democracy to all Western Hemisphere countries except Cuba , `` The human rights records of far too many of the countries , including the United States , remain tarnished and dismal , '' said William Schulz , executive director of Amnesty International USA .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;3	`` Most discouragingly , it appears as if the whole topic of human rights may receive the shortest of shrifts at the summit . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;4	Human rights is one of many issues mentioned in the declaration to be signed next week by President Clinton and 33 other presidents from the Americas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;5	But the major focus of the summit , hosted by Clinton in Miami , will be the leaders ' pledge to create a hemisphere-wide free-trade area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;6	Mike Canning , a spokesman for the State Department office organizing the summit , rebutted Amnesty 's criticism .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;7	Consultations among summit nations to produce the presidents ' communique `` more than adequately recognized the importance of protecting human rights , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;8	`` It 's not just something mentioned in passing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;9	This is something that the countries and the leaders are going to take very seriously at the summit . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;10	But Argentine human rights activist Emilio Fermin Mignone , participating in the Amnesty International news conference , said the draft communique does not call for an end to impunity for the perpetrators of human rights abuses such as kidnappings , torture , rape and murder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;11	He called on Clinton and the other leaders to `` eliminate a tacit acceptance of impunity in the hemisphere . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;12	Many countries that have switched from military dictatorships to democracy -- including Brazil , Argentina , Chile and Uruguay -- have amnesty laws or arrangements that permit human rights abusers to avoid prosecution , he noted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;13	Violators linked to mass killings or other notorious abuses in Peru , Colombia and El Salvador also went free , Schulz said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;14	Human rights groups have cited numerous Latin countries for gross human rights violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;15	`` Sometimes children are killed simply because they are seen as a nuisance , a tragedy repeated again and gain for the street children of Brazil , Guatemala and Colombia , '' said an Amnesty report prepared for the Miami summit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;16	The report accuses the United States of police brutality and criticizes it for using the death penalty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;17	Guatemalan rights activist Carmen Angelica Valenzuela , a former professor and physician in Guatemala City , spoke Thursday of her abduction and torture by members of the Guatemalan army in 1990 , saying the military apparently considered her subversive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0431;18	She said Guatemala 's armed forces are `` directly responsible for the most brutal campaign of terror in the Western Hemisphere . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;0	Yasser Arafat 's government on Thursday took control of the health and taxation systems in the West Bank , broadening Palestinian autonomy despite a pall cast on peacemaking by a series of Islamic terror attacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;1	The move completed the initial stage of handing over day-to-day affairs in the West Bank to Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;2	It also came amid growing calls in Israel for shutting off Palestinians from Israel because of a series of attacks in which 32 Israelis have been killed since early October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;3	About 1,000 people gathered Thursday in the northern Israeli town of Afula for the funeral of the latest victim , 19-year-old woman soldier Liat Gabai , who was axed to death on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;4	A suspect detained Wednesday , Wahib Abu Rub , 24 , from the West Bank town of Qabatiyah , has told interrogators he was from the Islamic Resistance Movement or Hamas , Israel radio said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;5	The same group claimed the Oct. 19 Tel Aviv bus bombing that killed 22 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;6	Abu Rub admitted to the slaying in an interview on Israel television .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;7	Speaking as he was led to the Nazareth court Thursday , he said he wanted to prove to fellow Palestinians he was n't collaborating with Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;8	`` They accused me of being a traitor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;9	I wanted to prove that I was n't , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;10	`` I killed the soldier to prove to my people I am a decent man . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;11	Police Minister Moshe Shahal responded by calling Thursday for completely shutting off the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;12	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;13	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;14	A closure could also bring further violence , by preventing thousands of Palestinian day workers from entering Israel to earn a living .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;15	Palestinian and Israeli leaders have blamed growing support for Islamic radicals on economic troubles in the PLO-run Gaza Strip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;16	Despite the violence , talks were expected to begin next week on stage two of the autonomy given Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho last May -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;17	Israel 's concern for the safety of 120,000 Jewish settlers has prompted some officials to propose skipping the interim phase altogether and negotiating the final status of these territories now , rather than in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;18	Still , a gradual hand over of responsibilities to Palestinians proceeded in the West Bank where two ceremonies were held marking the transfer of the health and tax systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;19	The PLO has since August also taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;20	`` What we have completed gives the Palestinians a first entrance to the West Bank , '' said West Bank military governor Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar , signing over the tax department to Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi in Ramallah .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;21	In Brussels , foreign donors this week released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier , mostly to help the Palestinians meet running costs for a few months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0432;22	Deputy Finance Minister Atef Alawneh said he hoped to collect dlrs 300-400 million annually in taxes to try to overcome dependency on donor nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;0	Russia on Thursday upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from prepared remarks to criticize the allies for agreeing to a U.S. initiative to draw up the terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;3	Afterward , Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;4	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;5	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;6	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;7	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;8	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;9	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;10	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , sought to respond to Kozyrev 's remarks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;11	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;12	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;13	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;14	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;15	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;16	In an effort to heal the wounds , Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;17	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;18	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to draw in its one-time partners in the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;19	The Europeans in particular have been uneasy about pushing expansion for fear of upsetting Russia , still a formidable military power at the edge of allied territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;20	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;21	They had insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;22	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;23	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;24	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership cards and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;25	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;26	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;27	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;28	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;29	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;30	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;31	No list of front-runners for membership will be made ; no date set for the first admissions will be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;32	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;33	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;34	He said the Russians too `` do not exclude the possibility of wanting to become members of NATO . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0433;35	He insisted `` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0434;0	Russia upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes Thursday by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .

APW_ENG_19941201.0435;0	Russia wants its key western partners to back a confederation of Bosnian Serbs with neighboring Serbia itself , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;1	`` We do support the suggestion that the ` Contact Group ' comes out with an unambiguous recognition '' of Bosnian Serbs ' right to forge political links with the government in Belgrade , Kozyrev told reporters .

APW_ENG_19941201.0435;4	It thus sought to heal a rift with the European allies over NATO 's use of force in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;5	Kozyrev met here with this NATO counterparts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;6	Speaking to reporters as he left the NATO headquarters , he said a Serb confederation would be akin to the confederation of Croatia and the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;7	The latter is part of the current Contact Group peace plan for Bosnia that Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;8	Kozyrev said if Croatia and the government in Sarajevo can link up politically , `` the Bosnian Serbs have ... equal right to confederate with Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;9	Earlier , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he hoped Friday 's meeting of the Contact Group would launch `` a new initiative '' to end the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0435;10	Juppe will travel to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;0	Rewards given to North Korea for promising to freeze its nuclear program could lead to nuclear blackmail from other rogue nations such as Iran , senators contended in a hearing Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;1	The Clinton administration 's chief negotiator with North Korea , Robert Gallucci , countered that the agreement reached on Oct. 21 has already stopped the North Korean nuclear weapons program and `` achieves more than we and the international community thought possible '' when talks began in early 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;2	But Gallucci met a skeptical audience in the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;3	`` I have serious reservations about giving North Korea the benefit of the doubt , '' said subcommittee Chairman Charles Robb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;4	Robb said the agreement to supply North Korea with oil and new nuclear power reactors in exchange for shutting down its current nuclear program was a `` fundamental shift '' in the U.S. policy of penalizing nations that violate international nuclear proliferation accords .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;5	`` Some have even characterized this as nuclear blackmail '' that might encourage such countries as Iran to demand similar favors for not developing nuclear weapons programs , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;6	Republican Sen. Frank Murkowski a leading critic of the agreement with North Korea , faulted the administration for giving North Korea years before it will have to open up two radioactive waste sites to international inspectors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;7	The sites are thought to provide a key to whether Pyongyang has diverted plutonium for nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;8	`` Why did n't we insist that they come clean ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;9	But Murkowski , the likely next chairman of the subcommittee when the Republicans take over Congress next year , did not suggest , as he has in past interviews , that he might try to block the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;10	`` I 'm not sitting here saying we should cancel the agreement , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;11	Under the agreement , an international group headed by South Korea and Japan is to supply the North with two light water nuclear reactors , worth about dlrs 4 billion , that are less susceptible to plutonium extraction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;12	The United States will provide 150,000 tons of heavy oil next year and 500,000 tons a year after that to compensate North Korea for shutting down its existing 5-megawatt gas graphite reactor and scuttling plans to build 50 - and 200-megawatt reactors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;13	The United States also agreed to remove some trade barriers and take initial steps toward opening diplomatic contacts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;14	North Korea also agreed not to reprocess 8,000 spent fuel rods and to eventually open up all facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;15	Gallucci stressed that all major technology for the nuclear reactors will be withheld until North Korea allows the inspections , ship the spent fuel rods out of the country and dismantles its current reactor program .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;16	`` We entered into this agreement without any uncertainty or delusions about past North Korean behavior .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;17	The agreement framework is not based on trust , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0436;18	Gallucci acknowledged that U.S. negotiators made concessions on the inspections issue , but said they did not harm U.S. security interests .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;0	Russians , angry at having to pay for U.S. visa applications even if they are rejected , lashed out Thursday at `` the latest insult '' to would-be visitors to the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;1	Ambassador Thomas Pickering announced the $ 20 application fee on Wednesday as part of changes intended to improve an application process that has been criticized as rude and humiliating .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;2	The fee , charged on top of the price of a visa , took effect Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;3	`` I wonder why we 're trying so hard to go to this ` wonderful ' country , America , when its embassy has so little respect for us , '' said Sergei Tumbasov , a construction engineer hoping to go to Virginia on business .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;4	Tumbasov said no one told him about the fee until he arrived at the embassy Thursday morning , not even the consular officer he spoke to the day before .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;5	The application fee , equal to nearly a week 's wages for the average Russian , is especially painful for the more than 100 visa applicants who are rejected every day at the U.S. Embassy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;6	`` This unexpected fee is the final insult in an absolutely absurd process , '' said Dr. Marina Orlova , an eye doctor from the prestigious Fyodorov Clinic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;7	She was turned away for failing to prove she would return to Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;8	`` Who do they think we are ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;9	We 're doctors , professionals , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;10	If Orlova returns with documents to support her application , she has to pay another $ 20 fee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;11	That does n't include the fee for the visa itself , which is $ 20 for one entry , or $ 120 for a multiple-entry permit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;12	`` The system is made for the mafia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;13	No one else can afford it , '' Orlova added loudly , prompting a guard to ask her to leave the crowded sidewalk in front of the embassy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;14	An average of 550 people apply for visas at the U.S. Embassy every day , and about 133,000 people have applied in the past year , according to the embassy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;15	The consular office is n't big enough to hold the crowd of waiting applicants , many of whom wait for hours outdoors , even in Moscow 's bitter December weather .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;16	Vladimir Gulagin , a technical consultant planning a business trip to New York , brushed falling snow off a suitcase full of documents Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;17	Gulagin was refused a visa on Tuesday and was told to return with further documentation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;18	He was not told , however , about the new fee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;19	`` It 's a good thing I had borrowed money from my wife this morning , '' Gulagin said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;20	`` I spent most of my paycheck yesterday , getting all these documents copied . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;21	The steps announced Wednesday by Pickering include an `` express lane '' and easier processing for business visa applications .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;22	Vasily Ignatkin , head of the visa department at the Diplomatic Corps Administration Bureau , welcomed the changes , but said it would be `` some time before any serious improvements are evident . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;23	Those in line outside the embassy were skeptical .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;24	`` It 's all talk , '' Tumbasov said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0437;25	`` They 're trying to comfort us while they ask us for more money . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;0	Russia upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes Thursday by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from a prepared speech to criticize the allies for ordering aides to draw up terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;3	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;4	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;5	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;6	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;7	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;8	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;9	Willy Claes , the Western military alliance 's new secretary-general , sought to respond to Kozyrev 's remarks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;10	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;11	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;12	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;13	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;14	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;15	In an effort to heal the wounds , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;16	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;17	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to draw in its one-time partners in the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;18	The Europeans in particular have been uneasy about pushing expansion for fear of upsetting Russia , still a formidable military power at the edge of allied territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;19	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;20	They had insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;21	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;22	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;23	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;24	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;25	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;26	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0438;27	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;0	The latest assassinations of two journalists in Algeria was carried out by gunmen who forced them out of their homes , then shot and decapitated them , Algerian television reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;1	The killings bring the number of journalists slain to 27 since the profession became a target of Islamic extremists 18 months ago , according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;2	Ahmed Issaad , a reporter for the state television , and Nasseredine Lekhal , a journalist for the state-run daily El-Massa , were earlier reported by security services to have been stabbed to death in Boufarik , south of Algiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;3	Three other people were also slain , including the vice president and a member of Boufarik 's municipal council , appointed to replace fundamentalists elected but later banned from office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;4	TV footage showed the victims ' bullet-riddled , headless bodies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;5	More than 11,000 people have been killed in a three-year insurgency pitting Muslim fundamentalist militants against the army-backed government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;6	The toll sharply increased in November , with more than 400 people killed in the bloodiest month since the start of the insurgency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;7	Most of the known victims for November were extremists killed by security forces , ordered to step up their campaign to `` eradicate terrorists '' after a failed government effort to negotiate with fundamentalists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;8	The militants , depicting the media as government pawns , have designated journalists as a prime target of their assassination campaign , along with foreigners and intellectuals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0439;9	An estimated 200 Algerian journalists have left the country because of the killings and harsh government action against newspapers which violate strict security regulations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;0	Russia on Thursday upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from prepared remarks to criticize the allies for agreeing to a U.S. initiative to draw up the terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;3	Afterward , Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;4	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;5	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .

APW_ENG_19941201.0440;29	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;30	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;31	No list of front-runners for membership will be made ; no date set for the first admissions will be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;32	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;33	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;34	He said the Russians too `` do not exclude the possibility of wanting to become members of NATO . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0440;35	He insisted `` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;0	President Ernesto Zedillo promised Thursday to maintain the tenuous cease-fire in southern Mexico and fight a war on the crushing poverty that inspired the rebellion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;1	Zedillo sought in his inaugural address before 1,500 foreign and local dignitaries to be a voice of reconciliation in a country shaken by kidnappings , assassination and the New Year 's Day rebellion in Chiapas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;2	`` This year Mexican spirits have been saddened by the events in Chiapas , by the violence and even more so by conditions of deep-rooted injustice ; by the conditions of extreme poverty and neglect that fuels that violence , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;3	But Zedillo , who had not yet publicly said how he would handle the Chiapas rebellion , signaled he intended to try to restart peace talks last held in March .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;4	The rebels rejected one peace plan by Zedillo 's predecessor , Carlos Salinas de Gortari , and broke off talks with the government in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;5	`` I am convinced that it is possible to achieve a new negotiation in Chiapas that will lead us to a just honorable and definitive peace , '' Zedillo said to loud applause in the Chamber of Deputies , where he took his oath .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;6	`` There will be no violence by the government and I am confident that neither will there be by those who dissent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;7	The Mexican army will maintain its unilateral cease-fire . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;8	Zedillo was the campaign manager for the ruling party 's first candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , and assumed the candidacy after Colosio 's March 23 assassination in Tijuana .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;9	Six months later , another top political figure , ruling party secretary-general Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , was assassinated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;10	`` The brutal assassinations of two of Mexico 's most outstanding public figures have deeply hurt our citizens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;11	Some seeds of concern and doubt regarding some institutions , have divided the people of Mexico , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;12	Both killings raised speculation of a political conspiracy to silence reformist voices in government since the victims were relative moderates within the Institutional Revolutionary Party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;13	`` Thus far , the investigations have not been to the entire satiafaction of society .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;14	We the people of Mexico want to be sure we know the truth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;15	At this moment I am specifically directing the attorney general of the republic to significantly intensify the investigations , '' Zedillo said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0441;16	`` We will not rest until justice has been served , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;0	Mexico 's new president , Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , is a bookish , mild-mannered economist with little experience in the rough and tumble of Mexican politics .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;1	He was a poor public speaker and lacked charisma when he was first pushed into the race .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;2	But he appears to have had some intensive coaching since his election last summer and his inaugural speech Thursday was well delivered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;3	Colleagues give Zedillo , 42 , high marks as an economist , administrator and negotiator and say that unlike former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , whom he succeeds , he prefers conciliation to confrontation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;4	He is more comfortable at home , analyzing a difficult economic problem , or sharing a meal with Patricia Nilda Velasco , his wife of 21 years , than attending a diplomatic reception .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;5	His first exposure to politics came when the first presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , Luis Donaldo Colosio , named him campaign manager .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;6	Zedillo ran for the presidency only after Colosio , a charismatic crowd pleaser , was shot dead March 23 at a Tijuana rally .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;7	The new candidate looked downright bewildered when he began campaigning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;8	`` I certainly never thought I 'd be here , never in my life , '' Zedillo said recently .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;9	But his party , which has not lost a presidential election in 65 years , geared up its huge machine and got him elected Aug. 21 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;10	The Zedillos , who have five children , have long lived in Lomas de Las Quebradas , a middle-class neighborhood at the foot of a towering dormant volcano , on Mexico City 's southern edge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;11	He understands what poor people go through .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;12	He was one of them for years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;13	Born in Mexico City on Dec. 27 , 1951 , Zedillo was the second of six children of Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo , a poor electrician , and Martha Alicia Ponce de Leon , who abandoned her studies to become a homemaker .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;14	Work was scarce and word was jobs were available along the U.S. border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;15	So the family moved to Mexicali and the muddy neighborhood of Pueblo Nuevo , just yards from the California border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;16	Mrs. Zedillo was the mainstay of the struggling family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;17	To make ends meet , she sold candy at a neighborhood movie house , and the children could watch movies free on Saturdays .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;18	Zedillo shined shoes and sold newspapers on the streets , learning to speak a `` Spanglish '' variant called `` pocho . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;19	Few of his childhood dreams became reality .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;20	One was to become a big league baseball player , he confided to a friend .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;21	Instead , he went on to become a straight-A student .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;22	After he finished high school , he and his elder brother Luis Eduardo moved to Mexico City in 1966 , sharing a tiny apartment in a low-income project .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;23	Zedillo studied economics at the National Polytechnic Institute , the so-called poor man 's university .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;24	Still poor , the rest of the family moved back to Mexico City in search of a better life .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;25	The death of his mother a few months later came as a terrific blow -- she was only 38 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;26	Zedillo joined Mexico 's ruling party in 1967 , and party bosses helped him get bigger and better scholarships that allowed postgraduate work at the University of Bradford , England , and the University of Colorado .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;27	He also taught at the Polytechnic , where he met his future wife .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;28	A few weeks after their wedding , they left for New Haven , Conn. , where he earned a master 's , then a doctorate in economics at Yale in 1978 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;29	Back in Mexico City , Zedillo worked for the Bank of Mexico -- the nation 's federal reserve .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;30	He then moved to the Treasury Department and then the Department of Budget and Planning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0442;31	There he became friends with Salinas and other young technocrats , most of them Ivy League graduates bent on modernizing Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;0	In open contempt for U.N. authority in Bosnia , Serb fighters kidnapped more international peacekeepers and pressed their stranglehold on a town in the northwest on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;1	In a small sign of willingness to negotiate , however , Bosnian Serbs agreed to meet Yasushi Akashi , the top U.N. envoy , on Friday in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;2	The Serbs snubbed U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday because he insisted talks be held in Sarajevo , capital of the Muslim-led , internationall recognized governmment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;3	Bosnian Serb fighters on Tuesday crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers , taking them and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;4	He said the United Nations has not heard from the troops since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;5	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , allowing for the unimpeded movement into Bosnia of equipment and personnel from Serb-held Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;6	Serb fighters from the two countries have joined forces in the Bihac offensive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;7	The Serbs have taken more than 400 U.N. peacekeepers hostage as insurance against further NATO airstrikes since allied planes bombed Serb positions in Bosnia and Croatia three times last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;8	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;9	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in the Bihac enclave , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;10	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;11	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;12	Between May and October , Serbs allowed only a dozen to pass through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;13	The Serbs agreed to the Akashi meeting after Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , traveled to Pale for talks with Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;14	Rose 's talks in Pale were to have focused on Bihac and its demilitarization , but there appeared to be no narrowing of differences that could end the siege .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;15	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the so-called Bosnian Serb assembly , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government supports , saying Serbs would accept only a permanent cease-fire leading to a formal end of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;16	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent agreement would cement the Serb hold over 70 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;17	An international peace plan , which the Bosnians have accepted and the Serbs rejected , would force Serbs to settle for 49 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;18	With new U.S. support for Europe 's position that diplomacy , not further NATO airstrikes , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian war , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his British counterpart , Douglas Hurd , planned to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;19	Milosevic is considered responsible for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;20	But he still has influence with the Bosnian Serbs , despite his breaking with them last summer after they rejected the international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;21	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs to establish confederal links with Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;22	The plan also gives Bosnian Croats the right to set up a confederation with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;23	Critics , however , say that is appeasement and a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;24	But Krajisnik said possible linkage with Yugoslavia was not as important as changing the proposed territorial maps , the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;25	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were running increasingly short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;26	Heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire erupted around Bihac late Wednesday and early Thursday , along with heavy fighting southwest and south of the Bihac pocket , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;27	Two civilians were killed in Bihac Wednesday by gunfire , Ms. Tuffelli said , but overall the area was calmer Thursday morning with only sporadic shelling and small arms fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;28	Bosnian radio and Bihac regional officials painted a different picture by Thursday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;29	Radio said Serbs intensified their attacks later in the day on Bihac , Cazin and Velika Kladusa , all government-held towns in the Bihac enclave .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;30	Hamdija Kabiljagic , the regional mayor , also reported increased fighting along the perimeters of Bihac and shelling of the town itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;31	He accused the United Nations of deliberately downplaying the situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;32	There was no U.N. confirmation of the reported afternoon upsurge in fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;33	In downtown Sarajevo , Serbs targeted two government buildings with anti-tank missiles , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0443;34	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed , and the humanitarian airlift suspended , because Serbs had not given security guarantees and are able to threaten planes ' approach route with surface-to-air missiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;0	A fireworks warehouse exploded in a town in southern Brazil , killing at least one person and wounding about a dozen others , a fire official said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;1	The explosion occurred at 9:30 p.m. -LRB- 1130 GMT -RRB- Wednesday on a block of small shops in the downtown business district of Uruguaiana , a city of 120,000 people near the border with Argentina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;2	The blast leveled five one-story buildings and damaged 10 stores .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;3	Two people are believed missing under the wreckage , said Sgt. Paulo Flores of the Uruguaiana fire department .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;4	`` The explosion was felt more than 30 blocks away , '' Flores said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;5	Earlier , a Uruguayan fire official who helped contain the blaze said as many as 10 people were killed and 20 were hurt in the blast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;6	Brazilian , Argentine and Uruguayan firemen continued to fight several fires around the blast site on Thursday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0444;7	The cause of the explosion was not yet known , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;0	Proponents of the world-trade agreement chant a mantra of impressive-sounding figures : a dlrs 744 billion global tax cut , dlrs 150 billion a year in added U.S. economic growth , up to 500,000 new American jobs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;1	But some of the pact 's most important provisions deal with ideas , not numbers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;2	For the first time in its 47-year history , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will include basic rules protecting patents , copyrights and other so-called intellectual property .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;3	That 's a powerful catalyst for more exports and investment in some of America 's most dynamic industries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;4	With the sweeping deal to liberalize commerce , the 124 nations in GATT not only agree to slash import duties and other trade barriers , they pledge to prosecute sales of knock-off drugs , purloined software , pirated videos and the like .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;5	That may sound trivial .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;6	But U.S. companies that make idea-intensive products lose tens of billions of dollars annually in potential export revenues because thieves are stealing their stuff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;7	GATT should especially be welcomed in places like Research Triangle Park , N.C. , and northern New Jersey , where many pharmaceutical manufacturers are concentrated , and California 's Silicon Valley and the Seattle area , home to numerous software makers and other high-tech firms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;8	Such industries are significant creators of new , high-paying jobs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;9	They 're also among the most aggressive exporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;10	`` Some of GATT 's biggest winners are high-tech industries , those that are our most globally competitive and make world-leading products , '' says C. Michael Aho , international economist for Prudential Securities Inc. `` The rules provide a more certain framework for them and should open markets overseas . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;11	For companies like Merck and Co. to develop a world-class medication or Intel Corp. to devise a faster computer chip , hundreds of millions of dollars must be spent on research and testing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;12	The GATT provisions , which require many countries to enact their first intellectual property protection laws , will encourage more American investment in new products , says David Walters , chief economist at the U.S. Trade Representative 's office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;13	Companies partly base their research and development budgets on expected rate of return and market size .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;14	`` If you 're a pharmaceutical company investing lots of money in developing a new drug , you have X number of years to recoup your R and D costs , '' Walters says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;15	`` If a country rips off your patent and pays you next to nothing , getting minimum standards of intellectual property protection is very important .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;16	If you 're a software developer , it 's also real important . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;17	The U.S. government estimates that American drug makers lose roughly dlrs 5 billion annually from piracy worldwide -- a big percentage of the nearly dlrs 28 billion worth of products they 're expected to sell overseas this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;18	`` If you look at any of the top-ten selling products in the world market , you can assume they are copied , '' said Tom Bombelles , a trade expert for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;19	With GATT 's new Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property rules , or TRIPS , he said , `` our companies over the long run can save several billion a year in lost sales . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;20	One disadvantage is that many developing countries , which are the fastest-growing markets , get 10 years to comply .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;21	Still , executives at Pfizer Inc. are happy that foreign copycats eventually wo n't be able to sell knockoffs of products like Diflucan , the world 's leading anti-fungal drug and a medication widely used by cancer and AIDS patients .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;22	`` It enables us to continue funding research , '' said Lou Clemente , a senior vice president at New York-based Pfizer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;23	`` As the company is more successful , there 's going to be more employment in the United States . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;24	Other prominent beneficiaries will be producers of computer software -- a U.S.-dominated industry since its inception .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;25	Overseas piracy of personal computer applications such as word processors and spreadsheets alone cost American makers dlrs 6 billion in 1993 , says the Software Publishers Association , a Washington-based trade group .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;26	Exports of such programs , by comparison , were about dlrs 4.5 billion last year and total worldwide sales were dlrs 8 billion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;27	`` There are n't many businesses that can function when they 're suffering theft that nearly equals revenues , '' says association counsel Mark Traphagen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0445;28	`` For smaller companies , it becomes a practical question whether they want to export and suffer serious piracy . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;0	Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the breakaway Chechnya republic , where leaders defied a Russian ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend their capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;1	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , claiming at least a few civilian lives .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;2	And a Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;3	Meanwhile , residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;4	The city has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;5	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;6	Russia says it offers the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;7	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;8	President Boris Yeltsin threatened on Tuesday to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya if both sides did not surrender prisoners and stop fighting by Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;9	On Thursday evening , Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of the ultimatum saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;10	The reissued document skipped all reference to a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;11	Trying a different tack , Yeltsin offered limited amnesty Thursday to Chechens who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;12	`` The use of force in Chechnya is doomed to failure , '' said Sergei Yushenkov , head of the Russian parliament 's Defense Committee , who led the delegation to Grozny and met briefly with Dudayev .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;13	In another sign that Russia sought to avoid direct confrontation , Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that some Russian servicemen who `` carried out certain military tasks for material compensation '' from anti-Dudayev forces had been brought back to central Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;14	He said more would be evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;15	Grachev insisted such servicemen were not in Chechnya on Army orders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;16	Dudayev 's government captured up to 70 Russians in fighting last weekend and alleges some were Army officers and soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;17	Chechen officials initially threatened to execute them ; Dudayev said Thursday they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;18	Despite Moscow 's softened tone , it still appeared to be beefing up troops on the borders of Chechnya , according to media reports .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;19	Dudayev , who held a news conference in the basement of his presidential palace as jets roared overhead , remained defiant , calling Yeltsin 's government a `` satanic power . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;20	Dudayev said his house had been bombed Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;21	A small military air base near Grozny also was hit in the air raid Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;22	And missiles hit a residential district at Katayama , about 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- from town , according to duty surgeon Aslanbek Otsalayev at Grozny 's main hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;23	Two women 's corpses were at the hospital , and Otsalayev said four people , including a 1-year-old , were killed and at least six wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;24	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;25	Elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;26	Although the economy is in shambles , many Chechens feel united in one thing : distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;27	`` I do n't like the opposition or Dudayev , but I 'll fight the Russians , '' said a restaurant owner who declined to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;28	Many Russians are content to let the Chechens go their own way , according to a poll Thursday by the International Opinion Research Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;29	The poll of 3,250 people said 74.2 percent believe Russia should recognize Chechnya 's independence , while 5.5 percent said it should n't and 20.3 said they could n't answer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0446;30	The margin of error was 1 percent .

APW_ENG_19941201.0448;0	CHICAGO -LRB- AP -RRB- - Soybean futures steepened their slide Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as nervous speculators cashed out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;1	Wheat , corn and oat futures rose modestly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;2	Soybean traders have become increasingly doubtful of the market 's ability to remain above dlrs 5.50 a bushel in light of this year 's record-large harvest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;3	Soybeans have been propped up by strong world demand for soybean oil and other vegetable oils , but those markets have been volatile this week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;4	`` This market stayed up a lot longer than everybody thought it would , '' said Jack Salzieder , marketing consultant with Commodity Services Inc. in West Des Moines , Iowa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;5	Soybean prices have fallen for three straight days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;6	Salzieder said soybean prices could be poised for a drop similar to wheat prices , which have plunged about 9 percent since early October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0448;7	In trading Wednesday , wheat for December delivery rose 2 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.74 3-4 a bushel ; December corn rose 1 cent to dlrs 2.14 a bushel ; December oats rose 2 cents to dlrs 1.08 a bushel ; January soybeans fell 6 3-4 cents to dlrs 5.56 3-4 a bushel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;0	Tennis great Martina Navratilova says she 's right where she wants to be : traveling and playing for fun after 22 years of pressure and high-stakes competition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;1	`` Now I will rest more .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;2	I will travel the world , but will keep on playing tennis for pleasure , '' said Navratilova before her first public matches since retiring last month after a first-round loss in the Virginia Slims Championships in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;3	Navratilova , 38 , was joined in Florence by one of the rising stars of women 's tennis : 14-year-old Martina Hingis , the reigning Wimbledon junior 's champion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;4	They were scheduled to play a match dubbed the `` generations game . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;5	The Czech-born Hingis , who lives in Switzerland , made her professional debut in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;6	Navratilova said she has considered teaching tennis , but has `` not yet developed my own method . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;7	`` Why did I not retire last year ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;8	`` My heart told me that 1994 was the year to call it a day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;9	I might be wrong when I take decision with the head , but certainly not when they come from the heart . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;10	Earlier , Navratilova and Hingis played on opposite sides in a mixed-doubles match .
APW_ENG_19941201.0449;11	Navratilova was teamed with Italian film producer Mario Cecchi Gori and Hingis played alongside retired Italian soccer star Giancarlo Antognoni .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;0	The 31st Chess Olympiad began in Moscow 's Cosmos Hotel on Thursday with a record 122 national sides competing in the men 's event and 78 countries in the separate women 's section .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;1	Each men 's team has four players and each women 's team three .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;2	The Olympiad was originally to be held in Thessalonika , Greece , but the event was canceled because of financial difficulties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;3	The World Chess Federation was then helped by world chess champion Garry Kasparov , who rallied financial support to hold the event in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;4	The backing came even though last year he had set up an entirely new organization , the Professional Chess Association , with Britain 's Nigel Short .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;5	Kasparov also heads the Russian team , which is favored to win , followed closely by the English national side which boasts Nigel Short , Kasparov 's last challenger for the world title , on board one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;6	Kasparov , however , was rested for the first of the 14 games and will only play when the Russian side begins to face the strongest opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;7	The Russians dropped half a point when Yevgeny Bareev was held to a surprising draw .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;8	Notable absentees from the Olympiad include Anatoly Karpov , the current FIDE world champion , Gata Kamsky of the United States and Viswanathan Anand of India .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;9	Kamsky and Anand declined invitations as they are currently preparing for the final elimination of the PCA World Championship Cycle for the right to meet Kasparov .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;10	That event will be held in Las Palmas in April .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;11	Karpov , however , would not play below Kasparov on the Russian side and also does not participate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;12	In the women 's section , the favorites are the Hungarians , who boast two of the three Polgar sisters , Zsusza and Sofia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;13	The third sister , Judit , is representing Hungary in the men 's event as she is currently the top player in Hungary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;14	Results of first round after six hours of play :
APW_ENG_19941201.0451;15	England-Mongolia 3-0 -LRB- 1 to finish -RRB-

APW_ENG_19941201.0453;0	Yasser Arafat 's government on Thursday took control of health and taxation in the West Bank , broadening Palestinian autonomy despite a pall cast on peacemaking by Islamic terror attacks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;1	The move completed the initial stage of handing over day-to-day affairs in the West Bank to Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;2	It also came amid growing calls in Israel for shutting off Palestinians from Israel because of a series of attacks in which 32 Israelis have been killed since early October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;3	About 1,000 people gathered Thursday in the northern Israeli town of Afula for the funeral of the latest victim , 19-year-old woman soldier Liat Gabai , who was axed to death Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;4	A suspect detained Wednesday , Wahib Abu Rub , 24 , from the West Bank town of Qabatiyah , has told interrogators he was from the Islamic Resistance Movement or Hamas , Israel radio said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;5	The same group claimed the Oct. 19 Tel Aviv bus bombing that killed 22 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;6	Abu Rub admitted to the slaying in an interview on Israel television .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;7	He said as he was led to the Nazareth court Thursday that he wanted to prove to fellow Palestinians he was n't collaborating with Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;8	`` They accused me of being a traitor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;9	I wanted to prove that I was n't , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;10	`` I killed the soldier to prove to my people I am a decent man . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;11	Police Minister Moshe Shahal responded by calling Thursday for completely shutting off the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;12	`` There is no alternative other than to demand separation , '' Shahal said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;13	`` Separation means that we do not have to open the territory out of economic and employment concerns until the Palestinians prove that they can prevent attacks . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;14	A closure could also bring further violence , by preventing thousands of Palestinian day workers from entering Israel to earn a living .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;15	Palestinian and Israeli leaders have blamed growing support for Islamic radicals on economic troubles in the PLO-run Gaza Strip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;16	Despite the violence , talks were expected to begin next week on stage two of the autonomy given Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho last May -- redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and Palestinian elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;17	Israel 's concern for the safety of 120,000 Jewish settlers has prompted some officials to propose skipping the interim phase altogether and negotiating the final status of these territories now , rather than in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;18	Still , a gradual hand over of responsibilities to Palestinians proceeded in the West Bank , where two ceremonies were held marking the transfer of the health and tax systems .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;19	Since August , the Palestine Liberation Organization also has taken charge of education , tourism and welfare in the West Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;20	`` What we have completed gives the Palestinians a first entrance to the West Bank , '' said West Bank military governor Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar , signing over the tax department to Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi in Ramallah .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;21	In Brussels , Belgium , foreign donors this week released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier , mostly to help the Palestinians meet running costs for a few months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0453;22	Deputy Finance Minister Atef Alawneh said he hoped to collect dlrs 300-400 million annually in taxes to try to overcome dependency on donor nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;0	Russia protested NATO 's plan on Thursday for expanding its membership to east European countries and backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;1	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from a prepared speech to criticize the allies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;2	He said their decision earlier Thursday to draw up the terms and conditions for future NATO membership would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;3	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;4	Afterward , Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;5	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;6	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;7	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;8	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;9	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said in impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;10	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;11	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , sought to respond to Kozyrev 's remarks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;12	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;13	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian minister just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;14	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;15	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;16	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;17	In an effort to heal the wounds , Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;18	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;19	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to enlist former members of the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;20	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;21	They also insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;22	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;23	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in central and eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;24	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;25	In an effort to meet their demands , but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;26	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;27	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;28	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;29	`` We took significant , concrete steps toward ... expansion '' of the alliance , Christopher said afterward .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;30	The move was intended to be a cautious one .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;31	No list of front-runners for membership would be made ; no date set for the first admissions would be set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;32	But Kozyrev accused NATO of trying to make a fresh division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;33	Some members of Partnership for Peace , he said , were destined to become members , while others would remain behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;34	`` Not all countries will be able to obtain membership at the same time , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0454;35	`` There needs to be some sort of clarification . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;0	After eight years of turbulent talks to draw up the new world trade accord , countries around the globe now are rushing the mammoth agreement through their national parliaments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;1	Nearly 40 countries , including most of southeast Asia , have ratified the 124-nation pact .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;2	About 40 more -- including trade giants Japan , the European Union and Canada -- have indicated they will do so by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;3	Three countries -- Switzerland , Liechtenstein and Cyprus -- have already told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that domestic politics will prevent them from ratifying the accord this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;4	But their absence alone wo n't stop the pact from taking effect as scheduled on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;5	All that is needed is for the all the big traders to come on board as founding members of the World Trade Organization -- GATT 's more powerful successor body that implement the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;6	The mostly low-key approach in many countries contrasts sharply with the loud and energetic opposition the accord raised in the United States , where The U.S. Senate was debating the pact for two days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;7	A vote was expected Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;8	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to free world trade and is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;9	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;10	Most governments object to at least some provisions because previously protected industries -- such as agriculture in Europe and textiles in the United States -- will suffer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;11	But all participating countries agreed not to upset the carefully crafted compromises with amendments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;12	The ratification situation in some of the main trading nations is as follows : -- European Union : Britain , Ireland , Greece and Germany have approved it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;13	The eight other EU members are meant to do so before foreign ministers meet Dec. 19-20 to approve the deal on behalf of the entire trade bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;14	France and Portugal still have some qualms , but the EU Commission , the union 's executive body , said there are no real obstacles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;15	An internal dispute between the Commission and member states over negotiating powers , which slowed national ratification , has been settled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;16	-- Japan : A key parliamentary committee has approved the deal , and full passage is likely in the next few days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;17	The government placated rice farmers , upset at potential competition from imports , with a six-year , 7.2 trillion yen -LRB- dlrs 74 billion -RRB- compensation package .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;18	-- South Korea : The ruling Democratic Liberal party , which has a big majority , plans to push the accord through the national assembly next week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;19	Opposition politicians and farmers accuse the government of making too many concessions under U.S. pressure to open the rice market .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;20	There have been frequent violent demonstrations against the accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;21	-- India : There was strong opposition from both left - and right-wing parties , especially to provisions that give foreign multinationals stronger patent claims to Indian seeds and medicines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;22	The opposition , however , seems to have run out of steam and legislative passage appears more or less certain , though no date has been set .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;23	-- Canada : Hopes to ratify the accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;24	-- Mexico : Under former President Salinas de Gortari , who is one of three candidates for the directorship of the WTO , Mexico was one of the first countries to ratify the trade accord .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;25	-- South America : Chile has ratified the accord and Argentina hopes to do so before the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;26	In Brazil , parliamentary passage is likely to be in February , not because the accord is contested but because of delays caused by this year 's election .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;27	-- China : In order to join the WTO , Beijing first has to enter GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;28	Western concerns about China 's market reform programs and a possible flood of Chinese exports mean GATT membership talks are unlikely to finish by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;29	Congressional clearance of a new world trade accord is expected to encourage ratification by other countries , enabling the mammoth export-boosting pact to enter into force as planned Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;30	Around the world , big and small nations alike are trying to rush the 22,000 page GATT agreement through national parliaments , often in low-key processes that contrast with the rocky ride through the U.S. legislature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0456;31	Others who have been waiting for U.S. leadership , will also follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;0	Forty to 50 Dominican prisoners ordered released by the courts but still behind bars rioted Thursday , burning mattresses and clothes in a call to be let out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;1	`` We want justice , we want liberty , '' the inmates shouted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;2	The uprising at the La Victoria prison 14 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- north of the capital city began at 9 a.m. and continued late in the afternoon as police tried to negotiate with the inmates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;3	No injuries were reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;4	An estimated 130 of La Victoria 's 4,000 prisoners were declared innocent or ordered released by the courts , including this country 's supreme court , months ago but remain in jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;5	Some were jailed only on the orders of police , without charges against them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;6	Human rights groups and the inmates ' families have demanded the release of the prisoners , known locally as `` the disrespected . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;7	President Joaquin Balaguer has said the prisoners should remain behind bars , arguing that the decisions to release them were tainted by corruption .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;8	He created a committee to review the cases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;9	The committee , headed by Attorney General Efrain Reyes Duluc , recommended in June that 30 of the prisoners be freed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;10	But they remain jailed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;11	Balaguer recently pardoned Jose Guillermo Chiari , a Panamanian pilot who was serving a five-year sentence on a conviction of trafficking 163 kilograms -LRB- 359 pounds -RRB- of cocaine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0457;12	His appeal was scheduled to go to court here Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;0	Retired Gen. Colin Powell , a child of Jamaican immigrants who worked his way up to become America 's military chief , returned `` home '' Thursday to receive one of Jamaica 's highest honors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;1	His wife , Alma , his three children and two grandchildren watched as Governor-General Sir Howard Cooke draped a green sash with the insignia of the Order of Jamaica over Powell 's neck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;2	`` Every Jamaican , at home and in the diaspora , sees in your achievement the embodiment of the best in us and an indicator that nothing is beyond the capacity of the Jamaican people , '' Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;3	Patterson and others recounted Powell 's climb from the South Bronx to Vietnam soldier , Army general , U.S. National Security Adviser , and chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;4	Even before Powell 's retirement in September 1993 , he had been frequently mentioned as a possible contender for the U.S. presidency in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;5	Patterson described General Powell as `` a beacon of hope and a source of inspiration . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;6	In an emotional but controlled response , Powell , 57 , reminded those attending that he was an American citizen and that the award was purely honorary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;7	`` But let it be clear to all present that I consider myself a Jamaican , '' he said to prolonged applause .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;8	`` A true son of Jamaica . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;9	Speaking for the millions of Caribbean descendants in the United States , Britain and Canada , Powell said that old-country values of hard work , education and family helped him and others succeed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;10	`` Wherever we went in the world we always have this home , even if we never had been born here , because our parents instilled in us the love of this country , the love of the people of this country , but most importantly , a love of the values that fuel this country , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;11	His three children had never been to Jamaica before this week , Powell said , `` but now we continue the tradition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;12	Now they know what it means to be a Jamaican and to come home . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;13	Later Thursday , Powell received a honorary degree from the University of the West Indies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;14	In an interview with The Associated Press , Powell said he was going to enjoy his retirement for a while and finish his memoirs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;15	`` And then , '' he added , `` I will see what to do with the rest of my life . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;16	The Order of Jamaica , the equivalent of a knighthood in the British system , entitles him to be called `` The Honorable . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0461;17	It is highest honor that can be given to non-Jamaicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;0	Serb fighters kidnapped more U.N. peacekeepers and pressed the stranglehold on the `` safe area '' of Bihac Thursday , underscoring their contempt for U.N. authority in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;1	The Bosnian Serbs did , however , agree to meet Yasushi Akashi , the top U.N. envoy , on Friday in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;2	They had refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday because he insisted talks be held at Sarajevo airport , in the capital of the internationally recognized government of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;3	Fighting between government forces and allied Serbs from Bosnia and neighboring Croatia continued in the Bihac area Thursday , prompting a warning from Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;4	`` Croatia will not wait for the fall of Bihac , '' Susak told reporters in the capital Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;5	`` We are monitoring the situation , and if Croatia 's judgment is that Bihac is about to fall , Croatia will intervene . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;6	The fall of Bihac would effectively unite Serb territory in northern Bosnia with Serb-held land in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;7	The Zagreb government would view that as a greater threat to its sovereignty , even as it increasingly talks of using force to regain control over the one-third of Croatia occupied by its Serbs since a truce halted their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;8	The Akashi meeting was arranged during talks in Pale between Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , and Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;9	Rose went to Pale to discuss a possible cease-fire and demilitarization of Bihac , as well as the fate of more than 400 peacekeepers held hostage by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;10	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said the latest kidnappings occurred Tuesday when Bosnian Serb units crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;11	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , and the United Nations has not heard from its troops since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;12	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , allowing for the unimpeded movement into Bosnia of equipment and personnel from Serb-held Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;13	However , there appeared to be no narrowing of differences that could end the Bihac siege .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;14	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the so-called Bosnian Serb assembly , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants , saying Serbs would accept only a permanent cease-fire as a prelude to a formal end of war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;15	The Sarajevo government fears any permanent cease-fire agreement would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;16	An international peace plan , which the Bosnians accept and the Serbs reject , would force Serbs to settle for 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;17	With new U.S. support for Europe 's position that diplomacy , not further NATO airstrikes , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian war , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his British counterpart , Douglas Hurd , planned to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;18	Karadzic later criticized the planned meeting , saying Milosevic `` did not start the war , and he can not finish it . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;19	The Bosnian Serb leader insisted that Juppe and Hurd come to Pale , adding , `` We can not accept to be treated like a rebel group . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;20	Nonetheless , Milosevic , who is considered responsible for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia , continues to wield the most power , even with the Bosnian Serbs , whom he rejected last summer over their repeated refusal to accept the peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;21	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs confederal links with Yugoslavia , a right the plan already gives Bosnian Croats with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;22	Critics say that is appeasement and a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;23	But Krajisnik said changing the proposed territorial maps was the crucial element to Serb acceptance of the plan , the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;24	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;25	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in the Bihac enclave , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;26	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;27	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;28	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were also running short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;29	Heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire erupted around Bihac Thursday , with sporadic shelling on its outskirts , said Maj. Herve Gourmelon , another U.N. spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;30	A mortar round slammed into a house in the center of town Thursday morning , but there were no casualties , he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;31	Bosnian Serb television showed close-up video of the city limits sign for Velika Kladusa , a government outpost north of Bihac , indicating how close they were to the town .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;32	In downtown Sarajevo , Serbs targeted two government buildings with anti-tank missiles , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0462;33	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed , and the humanitarian airlift suspended , because Serbs had not given security guarantees and are able to threaten planes ' approach route with surface-to-air missiles .

APW_ENG_19941201.0465;0	Moscow backed off from a threat to send troops Thursday into the breakaway republic of Chechnya , where leaders defied the Kremlin 's ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend their capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;1	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , claiming at least four lives , according to hospital officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;2	A Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;3	Residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;4	The city has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;5	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;6	Russia says it has given the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;7	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;8	President Boris Yeltsin threatened Tuesday to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya if both sides did not surrender prisoners and stop fighting by Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;9	On Thursday evening , Yeltsin 's office issued an altered text of the ultimatum , saying `` there was some disagreement in the media in interpreting certain clauses . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;10	The reissued document made no reference to a state of emergency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;11	Trying a different tack , Yeltsin offered limited amnesty Thursday to Chechens who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;12	In another sign of Russia 's desire to avoid direct confrontation , Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that some Russian soldiers who `` carried out certain military tasks for material compensation '' from anti-Dudayev forces had been brought back to central Russia , and more would be evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;13	Grachev insisted the soldiers were volunteers and were not in Chechnya on army orders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;14	Dudayev 's government captured up to 70 Russians in fighting last weekend and alleged that some were army officers and soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;15	Chechen officials initially threatened to execute them , but Dudayev said Thursday they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;16	Despite Moscow 's softened tone , it still appeared to be beefing up troops on the borders of Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;17	A tired-looking Dudayev held a defiant news conference in the basement of his presidential palace as jets roared overhead , calling Yeltsin 's government a `` satanic power . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;18	Dudayev said his house had been bombed Thursday morning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;19	A small military air base near Grozny also was hit in an air raid Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;20	The ITAR-Tass news agency said two women were killed and fuel depots were burning .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;21	Missiles hit a residential district at Katayama , about 12 miles from town , said the duty surgeon Aslanbek Otsalayev at Grozny 's main hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;22	Two women 's corpses were at the hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;23	Otsalayev said four people , including a 1-year-old child , were killed and at least six wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;24	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0465;25	Chechen elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0467;0	Incomes are growing so rapidly that free-spending Americans are n't keeping up -- and therefore the savings rate is improving , new figures show .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;1	A flurry of reports Thursday points to a remarkably strong economy with `` no dark clouds , '' said one private analyst .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;2	A day after reporting that the economy expanded in the third quarter more rapidly than earlier estimates , the Commerce Department released data that suggest the fourth quarter got off to a quick start .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;3	Americans ' income surged 1.4 percent in October , the biggest jump in eight months and the ninth straight gain , the department said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;4	With millions more Americans employed and being paid more , analysts expect a strong Christmas shopping season that got off to a brisk start last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;5	Spurred by a big gain in average hourly earnings and bonus pay for auto workers , the income advance easily outpaced consumer spending -- which rose 0.7 percent in October for its strongest showing since a 0.9 percent rise in August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;6	`` These are very strong numbers , '' said economist Eugene Sherman of the Wall Street firm of M.A. Schapiro and Co. `` It 's a very positive figure on the income side , so much so that people saved more money .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;7	And you know how much Americans hate to save . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;8	`` Everything is doing remarkably well , '' he added .

APW_ENG_19941201.0467;16	Financial markets were lower .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;17	At midafternoon , the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 20 points and the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond , which moves in the opposite direction of its price , was up to 8.02 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;18	The Commerce Department said the income gain was the largest since it rose 1.7 percent in February .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;19	Income last fell in January , when it slipped 0.6 percent .

APW_ENG_19941201.0467;26	The figure was revised upward from a 3.4 percent estimate a month earlier .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;27	`` The current quarter is off to a brisk start and fourth quarter consumer spending could rise at around a 3.5 percent rate , '' said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch and Co.
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;28	But , he added , `` that pace is unsustainable . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;29	The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year , most recently on Nov. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0467;30	Analysts expect the next boost to come Feb. 1 when Fed policy-makers conclude a two-day meeting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;0	Ernesto Zedillo was sworn in as president Thursday , vowing to broker peace with Indian rebels , work for his country 's impoverished millions and phase out Mexico 's one-party rule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;1	Zedillo , who was honored with a parade by thousands of rifle-carrying soldiers backed by armored carriers , smartly saluted the army and navy marching bands as new commander-in-chief and 63rd president of Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;2	`` We want a homeland of peace , '' declared Zedillo , 42 , a Yale-trained economist , in an inaugural address promising greater prosperity for all Mexicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;3	The oath was taken at a simple midday ceremony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;4	Departing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari transferred over the green , red and white sash of the office before 1,500 dignitaries including U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Cuba 's Fidel Castro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;5	The dignitaries were then taken in a caravan of gleaming black limousines to the National Palace , trailing Zedillo 's luxury car , guarded by jogging security agents and showered by confetti thrown from balconies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;6	`` We think he will be a good president ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;7	said Carmen Valencia , a 60-year-old housewife and exuberant ruling party supporter out for the national holiday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;8	`` He came from below and understands poverty . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;9	More than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators , however , rallied at the Monument of the Revolution and shouted slogans against the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has governed Mexico for 65 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;10	`` Out with Zedillo ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;11	the protesters shouted , jamming the plaza and raising banners calling for a civil insurgency near the monument , which commemorates Mexico 's bloody 1910-20 revolution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;12	Many of the protesters were civil supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , a guerrilla force that rebelled on Jan. 1 in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;13	Others were backers of Mexico 's leftist Democratic Revolution Party , the biggest opponent to PRI rule and the free-market reforms Salinas undertook during his six years in office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;14	The crowd at the Monument to the Revolution grew by the hour , although police made no moves to intervene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;15	Some protesters , mostly farmers in straw hats , had clubs and machetes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;16	Some residents were wary of the new administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;17	The past year was marked by an unresolved Indian rebellion in Chiapas , the March 23 slaying of the first PRI presidential candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , kidnappings and drug feuds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;18	`` We are all a little bit skeptical , '' said taxi driver Juan Angel Mendoza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;19	`` They all say the same thing and nothing happens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;20	But who knows , maybe Zedillo will be different . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;21	The 42-year-old president , who will guide Mexico until the year 2000 , promised to expand democracy and prosperity while stripping away many of the powers that have made presidential power nearly absolute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;22	`` The time has come to do away with centralism , '' vowed Zedillo in the ceremony at the ornate Chamber of Deputies , the lower house of Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;23	Zedillo pledged to balance the power of the presidency with greater independence for the courts , the congress and state governments , as well as for his own party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;24	Zedillo promised to launch a war on poverty and maintain a cease-fire with the Chiapas rebels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;25	`` Our most important challenge is to provide dignified living conditions for every Mexican family , '' he said , and vowed to use the free trade agreement with Canada and the United States `` to help generate the jobs we need and raise living standards . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;26	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , Zedillo was thrust into the campaign by Colosio 's assassination , the first major political killing in decades .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;27	He went on to win the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;28	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under Salinas , is sure to continue his predecessor 's free-market economic policies -- a commitment underlined by the Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;29	Leading negotiators of NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;30	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;31	Gore said 1994 was a year of `` unprecedented progress in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico ... and we look forward to even greater improvement in the year ahead . '
APW_ENG_19941201.0468;32	Zedillo also showed signs of a political opening with the appointment of a conservative opposition party member , Antonio Lozano , as attorney general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;0	Stocks tumbled Thursday as bond prices weakened on unexpectedly strong economic data , pushing interest rates higher .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;1	The stock market also suffered from a big drop in computer stocks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;2	Several rounds of computerized sell programs worsened the losses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;3	Bonds fell after the National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index of manufacturing growth rose to 61.2 percent in November from 59.7 percent in the previous month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;4	That was the highest reading since February 1984 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;5	In separate reports , the Commerce Department said Americans ' income surged 1.4 percent in October , the biggest jump in eight months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;6	And the Labor Department said first-time claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 317,000 , the lowest level in two months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;7	The data were `` considerably stronger than people were anticipating , '' said Robert Walberg , senior stock analyst at MMS International in Chicago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;8	`` They indicate that the economy remains robust , which increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will tighten -LRB- credit -RRB- down the road . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;9	The central bank has increased short-term interest rates six times so far this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;10	While few analysts expect another tightening this month , many expect an increase in January .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;11	Stock investors worried that higher interest rates will continue to lure investors out of stocks and into fixed-income investments , like bonds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;12	The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell nearly dlrs 5 per dlrs 1,000 face value early in the session but then recouped , trading down about 60 cents for a yield of 8.00 percent late in the day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;13	But the stock market did not recover with bonds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;14	Investors were nervous ahead of Friday 's scheduled release of November nonfarm payroll and unemployment data .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;15	Analysts expect the report to show a growth of about 250,000 in nonfarm jobs , and a steady unemployment rate of 5.8 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;16	A higher payroll figure or drop in the jobless rate could set stocks up for another tumble , analysts said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;17	Retailing stocks fell on weak November sales figures .
APW_ENG_19941201.0469;18	Overseas stock markets were lower .

APW_ENG_19941201.0470;0	Former President Daniel Ortega was hospitalized in Cuba after suffering a minor heart attack , his Sandinista party announced Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;1	Ortega was in `` satisfactory '' condition at a specialized hospital in Havana , the Cuban capital , a party statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;2	Ortega , 49 , president from 1985 to 1990 , is secretary-general of the Sandinista party and a leading contender for the party 's presidential nomination in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;3	Ortega was hospitalized `` after a heart attack that he suffered approximately three months ago was detected during a medical checkup , '' the statement said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;4	It said doctors were carrying out further tests .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;5	Ortega , a prominent figure among world leftists , went to Cuba a week ago for undisclosed reasons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;6	He has been embroiled in a power struggle over the past six months for leadership of the party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;7	Former Vice President Sergio Ramirez and other Sandinista officials have formed a faction calling for party reforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;8	The leftist Sandinistas came to power in 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;9	Ortega was part of a ruling three-man junta until being elected sole president in 1984 and assuming office in 1985 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0470;10	He lost a 1990 re-election bid to President Violeta Chamorro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;0	With many players taking a tough stance , the National Hockey League Players Association went back to the bargaining table Thursday still hoping to find labor peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;1	`` Many of the players -- I 'd say 90 per cent -- feel we 've given up too much already and we 're not going to give up any more , '' said Chicago 's Jeremy Roenick .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;2	`` I hope people realize how much the players have given up to get hockey back on the ice . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;3	Although initially opposed to any kind of salary cap , players have softened their stance on entry-level salaries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;4	But the two sides are still deeply divided on salaries for other players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;5	Reportedly , owners would like a maximum cap for first-year players set at around dlrs 750,000 a season , while players would prefer around dlrs 1.5 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;6	Players were expected to present the owners with their thoughts on other major issues , including free agency and salary arbritration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;7	`` The players wo n't have a salary cap , '' said Los Angeles Kings captain Wayne Gretzky , who was in Michigan with a team of NHL players for an exhibition against Detroit 's International Hockey League team Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;8	`` Everything else is negotiable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;9	In fact , we could start playing hockey right now if the owners would throw out the salary cap . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;10	Gretzky and a group of other NHL players locked out of North American rinks start a tour of Scandanavia Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;11	Until now , owners have insisted on a taxing teams whose payrolls exceed the average team salary , giving the money to teams under the prescribed limit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;12	The players have been against this so-called luxury tax , believing it has the same effect as a salary cap .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;13	Since team owners locked out the players on Oct. 1 , 347 games have been canceled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0471;14	Only 60 games remain on the schedule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;0	Researchers have isolated a genetic switch that separates the boys from the girls .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;1	It turns off the female in the human embryo and starts biological changes that eventually put hair on the chest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;2	Dr. Michael Weiss of the University of Chicago said the new study advances the understanding of the complex cascade that determines whether people are male or female and sheds new light on how this process can sometimes go awry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;3	In research to be published Friday in the journal Science , Weiss and his team use sophisticated imaging techniques to explore on an atomic level the biological pathway to manhood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;4	Their research report traces the development of maleness , from the turning on of the SRY gene , which is on the Y chromosome , to the work of another gene , called MIS , that removes the female parts of the original embryo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;5	Weiss said that science has long known that everybody at conception is female , but the precise biological mechanism that changes an embryo to male is still incompletely understood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;6	Solving the puzzle on molecular level may answer questions about other basic cellular changes , such as the development of cancer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;7	`` If we can understand the general switches involved in sex determination , then we could possibly relate that to other basic processes , such as how organs differentiate or how cancer arises , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;8	For the first weeks after conception , all mammal embryos start forming the basic female structures -- uterus , fallopian tubes and vagina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;9	`` The embryo destined to become a boy begins as a female , '' Weiss said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;10	`` It lays down first female structures and not male structures at a phase when the embryo looks like a recognizable mammal , with toes , fingers and eyes and a heart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;11	This is 35 to 40 days into human gestation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;12	After that , he said , a gene called SRY switches on to start the embryo on its way toward manhood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;13	The new study shows that SRY also triggers the work of another gene , called MIS , that dissolves the female parts of the original embryo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;14	`` SRY is the master switch , '' said Weiss .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;15	`` For the first time we have shown that SRY can activate a male specific pattern of gene expression leading to activation of MIS , which is the key signaling molecule for half of the male pathway . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;16	Sex determination in mammals originates with the chromosome of the sperm that fertilizes the egg .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;17	Male sperm can carry one of two chromosomes , X or Y. The Y chromosome is the male element that carries the SRY gene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;18	The female egg has an X chromosome .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;19	If the egg is fertilized with the father 's X chromosome , then the embryo continues its development as a female .
APW_ENG_19941201.0472;20	But if the egg is fertilized with Y , then the SRY gene sets off a series of changes that eventually creates a male .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;0	Deaths from drunken driving accidents in the United States have dropped by nearly one-third over the last 12 years as states raised their drinking ages and grass-roots campaigns raised awareness of the problem , the government said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;1	Last year , 17,461 people were killed in alcohol-related traffic accidents , down 31 percent from 25,165 in 1982 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;2	In 1982 , alcohol accounted for 57.3 percent of traffic deaths ; that had declined to 43.5 percent by 1993 , said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which collected the data .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;3	The number of intoxicated drivers involved in fatal accidents dropped 33 percent , from 21,780 in 1982 to 14,589 in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;4	The agency attributed the drop in deaths to improved law enforcement , states ' raising their drinking ages to 21 and lowering their legal limits for intoxication , fewer people drinking , social pressure against driving drunk and heightened public awareness because of groups that include Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;5	All states now have a drinking age of 21 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;6	The standard for intoxication in 45 states is a blood-alcohol level of .10 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0473;7	For a 72-kilo -LRB- 160-pound -RRB- man , that amounts to about five drinks within an hour on an empty stomach .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;0	Toronto 's Mats Sundin set up the opening goal as Djurgarden edged Brynas 3-2 Thursday to take a three-point lead in the Swedish Elite League .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;1	Djurgarden , which will play Wayne Gretzky 's NHL All Star team in an exhibition Dec. 9 at Stockholm 's Globe Arena , improved to 12-3-4 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;2	Sundin , who was traded to the Maple Leafs from Quebec in the off-season , assisted on Ola Josefsson 's power-play goal at 18:52 in the first period .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;3	Sundin now has five goals and two assists in seven games for his old Swedish team .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;4	He was cleared to play again in Sweden last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;5	Djurgarden 's victory , before a sellout crowd of 13,840 , snapped a three-game losing streak to Brynas at the Globe Arena .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;6	No NHLer scored in Thursday 's six games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;7	Lulea remained in second place despite losing 4-2 at Vasteras .
APW_ENG_19941201.0474;8	Mikael Renberg , who led all NHL rookies in scoring with the Philadelphia Flyers last season , was pointless after scoring in two straight games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;0	The independent counsel who investigates U.S. government officials will bring no criminal charges in the search of Bill Clinton 's passport files during the 1992 presidential campaign , he said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;1	Joseph diGenova , who has been investigating the matter for nearly two years , said his report will exonerate the former Bush administration officials who had been the subject of his probe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;2	`` No question about it , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;3	A three-judge federal panel appointed diGenova nearly two years ago , after President Bush 's attorney general , William Barr , found possible evidence of criminal intent in the search of the Democratic presidential candidate 's passport files .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;4	Late in the campaign , rumors had surfaced that while Clinton was a student in England , he had sought information on how to renounce his U.S. citizenship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;5	The unfounded rumors triggered Freedom of Information Act requests from the news media and an inquiry from a Republican House member , Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;6	Sources said the counsel will conclude that the case should never have been referred to the Justice Department in the first place , and that the investigation was bungled by State Department Inspector General Sherman Funk and his staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;7	DiGenova 's report , expected to be submitted in the next two weeks to the three-judge panel that appointed him , will fault Funk for overzealousness that drove his staff to do sloppy work , said one source familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;8	Funk defended his investigation and said he had `` no choice '' in whether to refer the matter to the Justice Department .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;9	`` Right or wrong , we had grounds for believing there was a violation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;10	The report also is expected to raise questions about the use by members of Congress of their positions to launch politically motivated inquiries , such as the search of Clinton 's files .
APW_ENG_19941201.0475;11	And it is likely to show that James A. Baker III , then White House chief of staff , knew about the file search and could have cut it off almost immediately , but did not , two sources familiar with the investigation said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;0	Showing more contempt for U.N. authority , Bosnian Serb fighters kidnapped more U.N. peacekeepers and tightened their stranglehold Thursday on the `` safe area '' of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;1	The Serbs did , however , agree to meet top U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi on Friday in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;2	They had refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday because he insisted talks be held at Sarajevo airport , in the capital of the internationally recognized government of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;3	Fighting between government forces and allied Serbs from Bosnia and neighboring Croatia continued in the Bihac area Thursday , prompting a warning from Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;4	`` Croatia will not wait for the fall of Bihac , '' Susak told reporters in the capital Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;5	`` We are monitoring the situation , and if Croatia 's judgment is that Bihac is about to fall , Croatia will intervene . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;6	The fall of Bihac would effectively unite Serb territory in northern Bosnia with Serb-held land in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;7	The Zagreb government would view that as a greater threat to its sovereignty , even as it increasingly talks of using force to regain control over the third of Croatia occupied by its Serbs since a truce halted their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;8	The Akashi meeting was arranged during talks in Pale between Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , and Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;9	Rose went to Pale to discuss a possible cease-fire and demilitarization of Bihac , as well as the fate of more than 400 peacekeepers held hostage by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;10	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said the latest kidnappings occurred Tuesday when Bosnian Serb units crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;11	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , and the United Nations has not heard from its troops since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;12	The Ukrainians ' observation point is now occupied by the Serbs , allowing for the unimpeded movement into Bosnia of equipment and personnel from Serb-held Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;13	However , there appeared to be no narrowing of differences that could end the Bihac siege .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;14	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the so-called Bosnian Serb assembly , again rejected a three-month cease-fire which the Bosnian government wants , saying Serbs would accept only a permanent cease-fire as a prelude to a formal end of the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;15	The Sarajevo government fears any permanent cease-fire agreement would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;16	An international peace plan , which the Bosnians accept and the Serbs reject , would force Serbs to settle for 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;17	With new U.S. support for Europe 's position that diplomacy , not further NATO airstrikes , is the best way to deal with the Bosnian war , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his British counterpart , Douglas Hurd , planned to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;18	Karadzic later criticized the planned meeting , saying Milosevic `` did not start the war , and he can not finish it . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;19	The Bosnian Serb leader insisted that Juppe and Hurd come to Pale , adding , `` We can not accept to be treated like a rebel group . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;20	Nonetheless , Milosevic , who is considered responsible for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia , continues to wield the most power , even with the Bosnian Serbs he spurned last summer for their repeated refusal to accept the peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;21	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs confederal links with Yugoslavia , a right the plan already gives Bosnian Croats with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;22	Critics say that is appeasement and a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal , a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;23	But Krajisnik said changing the proposed territorial maps was the crucial element to Serb acceptance of the plan , the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;24	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;25	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in the Bihac enclave , said food would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;26	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;27	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;28	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were also running short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;29	Heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire erupted around Bihac on Thursday , with sporadic shelling on its outskirts , said Maj. Herve Gourmelon , another U.N. spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;30	A mortar round slammed into a house in the center of town Thursday morning , but there were no casualties , he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;31	Bosnian Serb television showed close-up video of the city limits sign for Velika Kladusa , a government outpost north of Bihac , indicating how close they were to the town .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;32	In downtown Sarajevo , Serbs targeted two government buildings with anti-tank missiles , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;33	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed and the humanitarian airlift suspended .
APW_ENG_19941201.0476;34	That was because Serbs had not given security guarantees and are able to threaten planes ' approach route with surface-to-air missiles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;0	American schoolchildren face widespread fear , violence , weapons in school , victimization and poor communication with teachers and parents , according to a new survey .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;1	While violence in schools is not as pervasive as news media make it out to be , said pollster Humphrey Taylor on Thursday , `` the levels are obviously totally unacceptable . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;2	`` The survey suggests to me the need to stamp out the first signs of violence before they become commonplace , to have zero tolerance for violent behavior and to do whatever more is necessary to keep weapons out of school , '' said Taylor , chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Harris and Associates , which conducted the poll .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;3	Parents delude themselves if they think their children talk to them about such problems , the results show .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;4	Only 13 percent of parents interviewed thought their children do n't confide in them about school problems but more than 37 percent of the students said they hardly ever or never speak to their parents about them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;5	The results were released at a forum cosponsored by MetLife , which commissioned the survey , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for Workforce Preparation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;6	`` It 's easy for me to stand here and say these things , but very tough to achieve them , '' said Humphrey .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;7	Harry P. Kamen , his counterpart at MetLife , stressed the need for more involvement by parents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;8	`` Fifty-eight percent of all students believe their parents never exchange notes with a teacher or school official , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;9	`` Two in five students who have been victims of violence say their parents never talk to the school staff , not even by telephone . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;10	More than 1,000 parents with at least one child in public school and 2,500 students in grades three through 12 were interviewed by telephone in a one-month period beginning in April .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;11	The poll had a possible sampling error of 3 percent for the students and 4 percent for the parents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;12	In the month preceding the survey , `` a sizable proportion of public school students have had personal experiences with angry scenes or confrontations -LRB- 44 percent -RRB- , and physical fights -LRB- 24 percent -RRB- , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;13	In that month , 5 percent of all students surveyed said they had been threatened at least once with a gun and 7 percent with a knife .
APW_ENG_19941201.0477;14	Among students with mostly A 's and B 's , 4 percent had been threatened with a gun and 3 percent with a knife .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;0	Veteran striker GianLuca Vialli scored two first-half goals and Fabrizio Ravanelli added one goal in second-half injury time to lead Juventus of Turin to a clearcut 3-0 victory against Roma in their first-leg game of the Italian Cup quarterfinals Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;1	The Turin team , although missing injured star-forward Roberto Baggio , overwhelmed the visitors who ended the game with only 9 players following the expulsions of defenders Amedeo Carboni and Fabio Petruzzi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;2	Carboni was sent off the field at the beginning of the second half after receiving two yellow cards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;3	Petruzzi was expelled in the 91st after he fouled Vialli inside the penalty area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;4	Ravanelli converted the subsequent penalty kick in the 92nd minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;5	Thursday 's defeat at Turin 's Delle Alpi arena dampened Roma 's enthusiasm for Sunday 's 3-0 triumph against crosstown rival Lazio in a league match .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;6	Vialli , who restored his reputation of striker this season following a long scoring drought , tallied twice in the 22nd and 34th minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;7	Roma 's strikers Daniel Fonseca and Abel Balbo could not produce any clear scoring chance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;8	Thursday 's match in Turin , before 3,300 fans , completed the first-leg round of the Italian Cup quarterfinals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;9	On Tuesday Lazio downed Napoli 1-0 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;10	On Wednesday league leader Parma defeated Fiorentina 2-0 and Internazionale of Milan beat Foggia 1-0 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0478;11	Second-leg games are scheduled between Dec. 13-15 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;0	Michael Jackson is trying to end his 5-month-old marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , news reports in New York and London said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;1	`` It 's totally untrue , '' Jackson spokesman Lee Solters said of the divorce rumors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;2	A spokeswoman for mother-in-law Priscilla Presley agreed : `` It is absolutely , unequivocally not true . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;3	Those issuing the denials are the same folks who spent 11 weeks after the wedding saying the couple had never tied the knot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;4	Jackson biographer Christopher Andersen said he first heard rumors of a split on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;5	`` I had heard their lawyers were actually talking annulment , '' said the author of `` Michael Jackson Unauthorized . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;6	`` Are Michael and Lisa Marie friends ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;7	Sure -- they 've been friends for a long time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;8	But that 's not a marriage , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;9	Lisa Marie and Michael are married in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic in May , but rumors about the marriage were n't confirmed until August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;10	Andersen said the marriage was `` a scam '' from Day 1 , and now Lisa Marie wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;11	Gossip columnist Liz Smith intimates Michael viewed the nuptials as a `` public relations coup , '' but Lisa Marie fell in love and now Michael wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;12	Another Jacksonphile , author J. Randy Taraborrelli , blames the split on Lisa 's refusal to go East with Michael to his Trump Tower apartment in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;13	Whatever the reason , it seems only a few people expect the Jacksons to be exchanging silverware on their 25th anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;14	Or , for that matter , paper on anniversary No. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;15	`` I did say the marriage would be over by the end of the year , '' Andersen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0479;16	`` Not that I want to say I told you so . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;0	Russia upset NATO 's plans for expanding its membership to former Warsaw Pact foes Thursday by claiming the move would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;1	In an extraordinary session , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev departed from a prepared speech to criticize the allies for ordering aides to draw up terms and conditions for future membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;2	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;3	`` Moscow 's strategy is partnership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;4	If NATO 's strategy is partnership as well then we can begin working on this program as soon as possible .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;5	If the strategy of NATO is now aimed at enlargement then that is something that requires further discussions and possibly a different decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;6	The Russian had been invited to the meeting to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;7	The special ties had been designed to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;8	But Kozyrev refused to agree to the documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;9	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;10	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' he said impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;11	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;12	`` Moscow 's strategy is partnership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;13	If NATO 's strategy is partnership as well then we can begin working on this program as soon as possible , '' Kozyrev added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;14	Willy Claes , the Western military alliance 's new secretary-general , tried to reassure Kozyrev that NATO was not taking a new direction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;15	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;16	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;17	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;18	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;19	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;20	In an effort to heal the wounds , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;21	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;22	In the past , Moscow has strongly opposed any move by NATO to draw in its one-time partners in the Warsaw Pact , the defunct Eastern military alliance led by the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;23	The Europeans in particular have been uneasy about pushing expansion for fear of upsetting Russia , still a formidable military power at the edge of allied territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;24	In an effort to overcome Russian objections , the allies had agreed to develop a `` far-reaching relationship , corresponding with Russia 's size , importance and capabilities . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;25	They had insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc threatening Russia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;26	`` Having just overcome the division of Europe , we have no desire to see the emergence of new lines of partition , '' the ministers said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;27	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in Eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;28	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded coveted membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;29	In an effort to meet their demands -- but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;30	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;31	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0480;32	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;0	In the final act of the 103rd Congress , the Senate moved toward final U.S. approval Thursday of a historic world trade agreement eight years in the making .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;1	In advance of the Thursday night vote , an Associated Press survey showed 66 senators for or leaning in favor of waiving Senate budget rules -- six more than needed for the crucial procedural question that opponents had seen as their best hope of killing the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;2	While debate took up the entire two days , supporters predicted confidently that they would win approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by a comfortable margin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;3	The Senate vote followed a surprisingly large 142-vote margin of victory in the House on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;4	Before the congressional action , only 36 other nations had approved GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;5	But many other nations were simply waiting to see what the United States did .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;6	The agreement is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;7	`` I feel victory in the air , '' a jubilant Commerce Secretary Ron Brown told a crowd of cheering corporate lobbyists .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;8	Taking no chances on approval , President Clinton hosted a group of Democratic and Republican senators at a White House breakfast and worked through the day telephoning uncommitted senators .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;9	The 124-nation trade agreement cuts tariffs by an average of 38 percent worldwide , and for the first time extends GATT rules to such new areas as reduction of trade-distorting agriculture subsidies , lowering trade barriers in service industries , such as banking and clamping down on copyright piracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;10	It also creates a more powerful World Trade Organization to referee trade disputes and eliminates the one-country veto that a losing nation could use to block an adverse ruling .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;11	Supporters said the agreement , by cutting the border taxes Americans have to pay while at the same time lowering barriers U.S. businesses and farmers face overseas , would provide a tremendous boost to the U.S. economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;12	The Clinton administration estimated this would create a half-million new jobs and mean an annual increase of dlrs 150 billion in U.S. economic growth a decade from now , when the deal is fully implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;13	That extra growth would put dlrs 1,700 more a year in the pockets of the average family , the administration said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;14	However , opponents charged that the WTO represented a dangerous encroachment on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;15	They said that seven previous GATT negotiating rounds to lower trade barriers have not cured America 's chronic trade deficit nor stopped the hemorrhage of manufacturing jobs overseas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;16	They warned that in textiles alone , one of America 's most protected industries , 1 million jobs could be lost .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;17	`` We are not leading in world trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;18	We are losing , '' Sen. Ernest Hollings , a Democrat from South Carolina , a leading textile state , said during floor debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;19	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;20	Everybody knows that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;21	The administration was anxious for a healthy bipartisan victory margin as a way to show that a Democratic White House will be able to work next year with the first Republican-controlled Congress in four decades .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;22	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell took note of the fact that the vote on the GATT deal was the last act of what has been an often contentious Congress and the last vote of his congressional career .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;23	`` This agreement can fairly be characterized as historic , '' Mitchell said , saying he was happy that his last vote was `` on a matter that will have significance for generations to come . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;24	`` Those who oppose the GATT look to the past .
APW_ENG_19941201.0481;25	We look to the future , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;0	Lynn Jennings has won seven straight U.S. women 's cross country championships .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;1	She wo n't be satisfied until she wins 10 in a row .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;2	`` It wo n't mean much until I get 10 , '' said Jennings , who will go for her eighth consecutive victory -- and ninth overall -- Sunday at Blue Lake Park in Portland , Ore. `` Nine is a boring number . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;3	If Jennings wins , she would be the first U.S. athlete -- male or female -- to win nine national cross country titles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;4	A victory also would tie her with Pat Porter for the longest winning streak in championship history .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;5	Porter won eight consecutive men 's titles from 1982 to 1989 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;6	The only year since 1985 that Jennings did n't win was 1986 , when Lesley Welch was the champion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;7	Jennings , 34 , also has won the World Cross Country Championships three times , from 1990 to 1992 , and has been on two Olympic teams -- she finished sixth in the 10,000 meters in 1988 and won the bronze medal in the 10,000 at the 1992 Barcelona Games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;8	In addition , she has been a successful road racer for several years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;9	Of the three types of running , she prefers the track .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;10	`` I have a real love for cross country , '' Jennings said Thursday during a U.S. Olympic teleconference call .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;11	`` But it 's not what I 'm about as a runner .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;12	I have an Olympic medal on the track .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;13	I think of myself as a track runner . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;14	Jennings said she had not yet decided on which event to focus for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics -- the 5,000 meters , 10,000 meters or marathon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;15	She will make that decision after Sunday 's race , with her coach John Babington .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;16	Jennings , of Newmarket , N.H. , said she did not feel any extra pressure despite the historical significance of another victory Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;17	`` I just look at it as another race , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;18	`` I do n't think about winning another title . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;19	The field for the 6,000-meter race will be loaded with seasoned runners , including Olga Appell , Gwyn Coogan , Kathy Franey , Ceci St. Geme and Elaine van Blunk .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;20	Meanwhile , the men 's 10,000 meters will include four past winners -- Porter ; Bob Kempainen , who broke Porter 's winning streak in 1990 ; Todd Williams -LRB- 1991 and 1993 -RRB- and Bob Kennedy -LRB- 1992 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;21	Other top contenders include Mark Coogan and Marc Davis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;22	Williams , who beat Porter by 6 seconds at last year 's championships at Missoula , Mont. , and Kennedy have been training together at Bloomington , Ind. , under the guidance of Indiana coach Sam Bell .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;23	Williams , 25 , of Knoxville , Tenn. , thinks it has been beneficial .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;24	`` It worked out well , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;25	`` We were not trying to kill each other , we were trying to help each other . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;26	Williams twice competed in the World Cross Country Championships , with his best finish being 19th in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;27	He also was a 1992 Olympian , placing 10th in the 10,000 meters , the event he is focusing on for the '96 Games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;28	Sunday 's program also includes a 5,000-meter junior women 's race and an 8,000-meter junior men 's race .
APW_ENG_19941201.0482;29	The senior and junior men 's races will serve as qualifiers for the International Amateur Athletic Federation World Cross Country Championships March 25 at Durham , England .

APW_ENG_19941201.0485;0	Dan Quayle asked for a sandwich and a shower Thursday , and his doctor said the blood clots in the former vice president 's lung were dissolving rapidly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;1	Tests indicated the functioning of his right lung , where the clots had lodged , had improved , Dr. Homer L. Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;2	Quayle was being treated with a blood thinner at Indiana University Medical Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;3	He is spending half his waking hours out of bed , a sure sign that he is improving , and could be releaswed by Monday , Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;4	The 47-year-old Republican had been expected to announce within weeks whether he will seek the presidential nomination in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;5	He should be able to return to campaigning as long as he avoids sitting for long periods on airplane flights , Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;6	That was probably how the clots developed , the doctor said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;7	`` His most urgent desire today is to take a shower , '' said Twigg , who added later , `` He 's asking for a Big Mac . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0485;8	Quayle got the sandwich but not the shower .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;0	What if you were a nation that , after decades of not collecting income and other kinds of taxes , decided to start taxing your citizens and businesses again ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;1	And let 's say your new tax system was frequently criticized , generally disliked by the public , plagued by protesters and still struggling two years after adopting a controversial new tax policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;2	Where to go for help ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;3	Maybe a country with two solid centuries of experience in the fine art of collecting taxes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;4	One that hauls in more than a trillion dollars a year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;5	Internal Revenue Service Ogden Service Center , meet State Tax Service , headquarters Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;6	A delegation of three high-ranking Russian finance and taxation officials toured the Ogden IRS center Wednesday for a closer look at America 's sophisticated , automated and oft-excoriated system of income tax collection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;7	Rolling through the center more swiftly than a 1040 Short Form , the delegation observed the flow of work and walked through small canyons of computer hardware merrily going about the business of transferring personal income to federal government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;8	It was an impressive sight , said Vladilen Vorontsov , head of the Russian Federation State Tax Service 's accounting , reporting and analysis department .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;9	`` Russia is undergoing dramatic changes economically , politically and in terms of its new tax policy and administration , '' said Vorontsov , a slender bespectacled man in his late 50s with gray hair and a flawless pinstripe suit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;10	The country is entering the third year of a new tax system adopted after the collapse of the Soviet Union 's communist economy , he explained .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;11	The conversion is difficult because of Russia 's present economic situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;12	He was accompanied by Alla Zubkova , deputy head of the Russian Federation 's budget department , and Maria Reoutova , head of the STS ' accounting , tax statistics and information division .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;13	The Russian officials were scheduled to wrap up their Ogden visit Thursday with sessions on statistical analysis and tours of the Freeport Center and the U.S. Postal Service building in downtown Ogden .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;14	Vorontsov , who served as spokesman for the trio during an interview , said the delegation found the visit informative and helpful but added there is little chance the new Russian tax system will be modeled after its American counterpart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;15	For one thing , he said , the Russian system is much simpler with only about a dozen taxes of any kind at the federal level .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;16	Instead , it draws the bulk of its revenues from corporate rather than individual income taxes , which provide only about 10 percent of the federation 's tax collections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;17	`` Like anyone else , Russians are unwilling to pay taxes , '' Vorontsov noted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;18	`` The negative attitude is very deep , and I think one of the reasons is our people have had very little tax education .
APW_ENG_19941201.0486;19	`` It will take us quite some time before our taxpayers understand each -LRB- tax -RRB- is a contribution to a civilized society , '' Vorontsov said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;0	Veteran striker GianLuca Vialli scored two first-half goals and Fabrizio Ravanelli added one goal in second-half injury time to lead Juventus of Turin to a clearcut 3-0 victory against Roma in their first-leg game of the Italian Cup quarterfinals Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;1	The Turin team , although missing injured star-forward Roberto Baggio , overwhelmed the visitors who ended the game with only 9 players following the expulsions of defenders Amedeo Carboni and Fabio Petruzzi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;2	Carboni was sent off the field at the beginning of the second half after receiving two yellow cards .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;3	Petruzzi was expelled in the 91st minute after he fouled Vialli inside the penalty area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;4	Ravanelli converted the subsequent penalty kick in the 92nd minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;5	Thursday 's defeat at Turin 's Delle Alpi arena dampened Roma 's enthusiasm for Sunday 's 3-0 triumph against crosstown rival Lazio in a league match .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;6	Vialli , who restored his reputation of striker this season following a long scoring drought , tallied twice in the 22nd and 34th minute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;7	Roma 's strikers Daniel Fonseca and Abel Balbo could not produce any clear scoring chance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;8	Thursday 's match in Turin , before 3,300 fans , completed the first-leg round of the Italian Cup quarterfinals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0487;9	On Tuesday Lazio downed Napoli 1-0 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0489;0	A congressman is accusing U.S. gun manufacturers of decieving the public in ads aimed at getting women to arm themselves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;1	Rep. Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , said ads that have appeared in several magazines seek to frighten women into believing they can increase their safety by buying a handgun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;2	`` The tragedy is ... that nothing could be further from the truth , '' Schumer said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;3	`` Study after study has proven that a gun in the home simply increases the chance that an innocent person will be killed by that gun . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;4	The National Rifle Association denounced Schumer 's comments Thursday , urging women to `` ignore scare tactics . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;5	Schumer said he would file a complaint against the advertising tactics with the Federal Trade Commission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;6	`` In its battle for the hearts of American women , the gun ban lobby has forgotten that American women have minds too , '' NRA lobbyist Tanya K. Metaksa said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;7	`` As women , we not only have the right and the obligation to make our own decisions about safety and security -- we have the intelligence to do so . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;8	Schumer said he remains confident that most Americans support gun control , including two measures passed last year -- the Brady Law , which requires a waiting period for firearms purchases or the ban on some assault-style weapons included in the dlrs 30 billion anti-crime legislation passed this year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;9	`` Yes , a new Congress will convene in January .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;10	Yes , Republican leadership is hostile to gun legislation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;11	And , yes , the Brady law and the assault weapons ban are in jeopardy , '' Schumer said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;12	`` Those of you who like a good political fight , welcome to Round Two .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;13	The fight over rational gun laws is not over . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;14	Gun manufacturers began advertising directed at women in the 1980s after the male market became saturated and gun sales declined , according to `` Female Persuasion , '' a report released during Schumer 's news conference by the Violence Policy Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;15	The group used a full-age Colt 's Manufacturing Co. ad that features a woman tucking a girl into bed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;16	`` Self-protection is more than your right , '' the ad said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;17	`` It 's your responsibility . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;18	Colt 's officials were not immediately available for comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;19	Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey said gun manufacturers are simply looking for new ways to sell guns .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;20	`` It 's clear that the National Rifle Association and the gun manufacturers have a new target , which is American women .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;21	This is a cynical marketing strategy designed to promote gun ownership by preying on women 's legitimate fears of violence , '' said Lowey , who led a protest of 25 female representatives last year against the National Rifle Association 's `` Refuse to be a Victim '' campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0489;22	The NRA launched the campaign in 1993 to advertise a three-hour self-defense seminar for women .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;0	Draped in rubber armor , bristling with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' must be one of the Serbs ' oddest weapons in the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;1	All aboard -- if you dare .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;2	The train , similar to those employed in both world wars , has three combat cars and three freight cars hooked to the front to protect it from mine blasts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;3	It chugs to the front line , aims and fires and then quickly retreats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;4	But on Tuesday , the train took a direct hit from a missile fired by Bosnian government defenders of Bihac , the U.N.-designated `` safe area '' in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;5	The 20-man crew survived and the damage was minor , since a thick rubber curtain absorbed most of the blast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;6	The car was loaded with ammunition and the train could have exploded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;7	`` We were lucky , '' said Djuro , whose shrapnel wound to the leg was the only injury .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;8	A hundred yards long , roofless and loaded with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' -- named for the Krajina region of neighboring Croatia -- is an example of the firepower Serbs are throwing at defenders of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;9	The United Nations says Croatian Serbs have joined the fighting in the Bihac area , helping anti-government forces corner the Bosnian army 's powerful 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;10	Serb troops say they are determined to punish the 5th Corps for an October offensive that routed them out of the Bihac region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;11	The Serbs counter-attacked in early November and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;12	`` The 5th corps is in a desperate position and they will fight to the end , '' said Savo Bursac , who operates a 40 mm anti-aircraft gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;13	`` I do n't expect them to surrender , and they have nowhere to go . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;14	He said the train crew never would have gotten involved had the 5th Corps not attacked Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;15	`` This is to teach them a lesson and to end the war . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;16	Capt. Blagoje Guska , commander of the train , said it had been fired upon but never hit before the missile attack Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;17	The train usually draws no fire and crew members blamed overconfidence for getting hit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;18	It rolled back quickly from the dangerous position south of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;19	`` That was our fault , '' said Djuro , who declined to give his last name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;20	`` We went too close and stayed there exposed for too long . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;21	The motor on a triple-barrel , anti-aircraft machine gun was destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;22	A small fire was quickly extinguished and Djuro got a lift to a nearby hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;23	Earlier , on its first of three runs that day , the train followed its standard procedure of appearing suddenly , firing its deadly barrage and quickly retreating .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;24	Approaching from the south , it halted about two miles from Bihac and its guns joined the tank and howitzer fire on the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;25	The first shells were fired by a self-propelled cannon , aimed at what was said to be Bosnian army trenches on a remote hill .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;26	Then , missiles that had been taken off of jet fighters and refitted to the train were unleashed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;27	On its third raid , another anti-tank missile fired at the train hit a house about 200 yards away , setting it ablaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;28	The house was empty and there were no casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;29	Runs toward the government line are interspersed with breaks back at the train 's base about three miles from Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;30	On one run back to the base , small trucks followed with hot soup and fresh bread for lunch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;31	Morale was boosted by a short visit from Bosnian Serb army deputy commander Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic , who is directing the Bihac campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;32	Later , they sat around an open fire , playing accordion and singing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0491;33	` We are like family and we will be together till the end of this war , '' said Guska .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;0	About 50 Dominican prisoners ordered released by the courts but still behind bars rioted Thursday , burning mattresses and clothes in a call to be let out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;1	`` We want justice , we want liberty , '' shouted the inmates at the La Victoria prison 14 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- north of the capital city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;2	The eight-hour uprising was quelled only after police sprayed some 20,000 gallons of water into the cells and the country 's Human Rights Commission president , Virgilio Almanzar , asked the inmates to stop .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;3	No injuries were reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;4	Santo Domingo prosecutor Alexis Joaquin Castillo was scheduled to meet with the inmates Friday to evaluate their legal status .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;5	An estimated 130 of La Victoria 's 4,000 prisoners were declared innocent or ordered released by the courts , including this country 's supreme court , months ago but remain in jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;6	Some were jailed only on the orders of police , without charges against them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;7	Human rights groups and the inmates ' families have demanded the release of the prisoners , known locally as `` the disrespected . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;8	President Joaquin Balaguer has said the prisoners should remain behind bars , arguing that the decisions to release them were tainted by corruption .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;9	He created a committee to review the cases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;10	The committee , headed by Attorney General Efrain Reyes Duluc , recommended in June that 30 of the prisoners be freed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;11	But they remain jailed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;12	Balaguer in August pardoned Jose Guillermo Chiari , a Panamanian pilot who was serving a five-year sentence on a conviction of trafficking 163 kilograms -LRB- 359 pounds -RRB- of cocaine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0492;13	His appeal was scheduled to go to court here Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;0	Reports from Bosnian and Serb sources as well as the United Nations indicate Yugoslavia assisted in a crucial attack on northwest Bosnia , despite its public ban on war aid to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;1	Together with the involvement of Serbs from across the border in Croatia , Yugoslav assistance in men and material provided to the fuel-short and outnumbered Bosnian Serbs appears to have been a key factor in their favor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;2	The attack on Bihac this month called NATO 's bluff to use large-scale force against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;3	It has led to a rapid deterioration in the United Nations ' authority , and on Wednesday , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the 24,000 peacekeepers might have to be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;4	Slobodan Milosevic , the powerful president of Serbia , announced in August that the border with Bosnia was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;5	Although there have been regular claims by Milosevic 's foes that he was cheating on the ban , several hundreds international monitors sent to patrol the 300-mile border reported seeing no violations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;6	The international community generally took Milosevic at his word , and allowed an easing of economic sanctions in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;7	The ban hurt Bosnian Serbs , supplied through the 2 -LCB- - year-old war by Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;8	In October , the Bosnian army 's 5th Corps broke out of the Bihac area where government forces are completely surrounded by Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;9	They pushed the Serbs back in a surprise attack to the east and south .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;10	But the Serbs counter-attacked furiously in early November and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared Bihac `` safe area , '' which encompasses the town of Bihac and its environs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;11	U.N. reports , and sources in Yugoslavia lend support to Bosnian army claims that Yugoslav aid helped turn the tide at Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;12	Bosnian government officials said intelligence reports indicated fuel and ammunition trucks had crossed the border into Bosnia from Serbia , the main republic in Yugoslavia , and that armor , helicopters and rockets all had been provided .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;13	`` It is so obvious that ... Serbs received new weapons , fresh troops ... and fuel to move ` dry ' tanks , '' charged Gen. Jovan Divjak , a Serb who serves as deputy commander of the Bosnian army .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;14	`` Otherwise , they would n't have been able to put Bihac under such strong pressure . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;15	Reports from Yugoslavia and from U.N. observers indicate that Milosevic may have used the involvement of Serbs from Croatia to get assistance to the Bihac combatants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;16	While Milosevic said he was cutting off help to the Bosnian Serbs , he did not make a similar pledge regarding the Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;17	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had seen armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;18	The presence of fighters from Yugoslavia in Bosnia also was reported in Milosevic 's Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;19	The Svet weekly , based in the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad , said a special Serbian police unit of up to 1,000 men headed by a top police officer had joined the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;20	The weekly said the policemen crossed into Bosnia as civilians , and traveled through Bosnia to Croatia , where they received weapons and uniforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;21	A senior Serbian police official denied the Svet report .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;22	But reliable sources in Belgrade confirmed that Yugoslav army and police detachments actively took part in the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0494;23	Svet also reported that the only other republic in Yugoslavia , Montenegro , had shipped a large supply of fuel to Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;0	Toronto 's Mats Sundin set up the opening goal as Djurgarden edged Brynas 3-2 Thursday to take a three-point lead in the Swedish Elite League .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;1	Djurgarden , which will play Wayne Gretzky 's National Hockey League All Star team in an exhibition Dec. 9 at Stockholm 's Globe Arena , improved to 12-3-4 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;2	Sundin , who was traded to the Maple Leafs from Quebec in the off-season , assisted on Ola Josefsson 's power-play goal at 18:52 in the first period .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;3	Sundin now has five goals and two assists in seven games for his old Swedish team .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;4	He was cleared to play again in Sweden last month .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;5	Djurgarden 's victory , before a sellout crowd of 13,840 , snapped a three-game losing streak to Brynas at the Globe Arena .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;6	No NHL player scored in Thursday 's six games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;7	Lulea remained in second place despite losing 4-2 at Vasteras .
APW_ENG_19941201.0495;8	Mikael Renberg , who led all NHL rookies in scoring with the Philadelphia Flyers last season , was pointless after scoring in two straight games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;0	The American dollar advanced broadly on Thursday , hitting a seven-week high vs. the Japanese yen , as a set of strong economic numbers helped fuel expectations that the Federal Reserve will again raise U.S. interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;1	In a reversal of the trend for much of the year , currency traders are no longer dumping the dollar on signs of an accelerating economy because they 're confident the Fed will take steps to control inflation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;2	Attitudes have shifted since the central bank 's 0.75-percentage point hike on Nov. 15 , analysts say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;3	`` Strong data has helped the dollar because people feel the Fed is willing to mount a response to any inflation threat , '' said Amy Smith , senior currency strategist for the IDEA market analysis firm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;4	`` It may be a bit optimistic , but it 's driving trading at the moment . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;5	Previously , such numbers prompted Treasury bond market sell-offs that dampened demand for the U.S. currency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;6	Data released Thursday by the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated U.S. manufacturing rose last month to the strongest level in 10 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;7	U.S. retailers reported robust sales for late November .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;8	The Commerce Department said , meanwhile , that Americans ' incomes rose by a stronger-than-expected 1.4 percent and spending climbed 0.7 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;9	Bond prices dipped on the reports , but the decline appeared to have little impact on the currency market , in large part because of the newfound confidence in the Fed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;10	`` The linkage with the bond market is cut , '' said Dave Glowacki , senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;11	`` Bond investors who wanted to sell have sold .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;12	We 're back to the normal way of doing things .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;13	When the numbers point to a stronger economy , you buy the currency . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;14	Market participants said large U.S. investment funds and institutions were heavy buyers of dollars on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;15	Against the yen , that helped offset selling by Japanese companies that have accrued big stockpiles of dollars from exports to the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;16	Belal Khan , senior dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in New York , said U.S. investors increasingly are pulling out of Japan 's stagnant stock market and repatriating funds , while Japanese investors have shown a greater appetite for U.S. assets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;17	`` U.S. interest rates are looking very attractive and the U.S. markets are attracting capital , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;18	`` The dollar has found a bottom and is moving higher . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;19	In late New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 99.34 yen , the highest level since Oct. 13 , up from 98.93 late Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;20	In London , the dollar rose to 99.35 yen from 98.89 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;21	The dollar also was changing hands late in New York at 1.5733 German marks , up from 1.5693 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;22	In London , the dollar traded at 1.5743 marks , up from 1.5686 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;23	David Durst , a vice president at Bear , Stearns and Co. , said a good deal of the dollar buying was spurred by upward revisions of estimates for November U.S. employment data , which the Labor Department reports on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;24	Economists are expecting the report to show creation of 260,000 to 290,000 jobs last month , up from earlier projections of 230,000 to 250,000 , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0496;25	Other late dollar rates in New York , compared with late Wednesday : 1.3295 Swiss francs , up from 1.3265 ; 5.3915 French francs , up from 5.3820 ; 1,614 Italian lire , down from 1,617 ; and 1.3776 Canadian dollars , up from 1.3763 .

APW_ENG_19941201.0496;27	In London , the pound fell to dlrs 1.5655 from dlrs 1.5673 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;0	Days after an Arizona State University student acknowledged fabricating a column depicting the stoning of a paralyzed man in Israel , parts of her resume also appear to be fictitious .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;1	Mary Leigh Summerton , 27 , could face expulsion for a gut-wrenching account of a European Jewish quadriplegic who was supposedly stoned to death at the Wailing Wall in Israel for using a mechanical device -- his wheelchair -- on the Sabbath .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;2	The story , which appeared in the Nov. 15 issue of the campus newspaper as a guest column , apparently was an embellished version of a tale a feminist member of the Jerusalem City Council told students on the summer trip .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;3	She said she published the article in The State Press in order to enter the Hearst competition , a college journalism contest that recognizes superior published articles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;4	Now , Summerton faces a hearing for violating ASU 's code of conduct .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;5	Criminal behavior , plagiarism and cheating are included in code-of-conduct standards and can be punished by measures from probation to expulsion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;6	Summerton , a former reporter and editor for The State Press , has been at Arizona State since the summer of 1993 working on a bachelor 's degree in journalism .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;7	On her resume , however , she claims to already have bachelor 's and master 's degrees in chemistry from the University of Miami in Florida .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;8	But Summerton never enrolled at the University of Miami , let alone received any degrees , said Sandra Bouie , who works in the registrar 's office there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;9	She also attended ASU for one semester in the fall of 1990 -- the same time her resume places her at the University of Miami , working on her master 's degree .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;10	Maricopa County Community College District personnel records show Summerton never had a job there although she often told other students he worked as a lab instructor at Mesa Community College .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;11	And while she did work at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix from Feb. 25 , 1991 , to March 10 , 1994 , it was not as a chemist as she claims on her resume but as an assistant to the pharmacist .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;12	The senior journalism student also claims on her resume to be a contributing writer to the Journal of Chemical Education , a well-known academic journal for chemists , teachers and students .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;13	`` Not only did she not write for us , the job she names is fictitious , '' said Debora Bittaker , assistant editor of the journal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;14	Summerton also claims she is from Florida , but school records show she graduated from Arizona 's Tolleson High School in 1985 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;15	`` Obviously , fidelity to the truth is not one of her strong points , '' said Jeffrey Ross of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith , who led an expedition of 18 college journalists to Poland and Israel this past summer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;16	`` At least there 's a pattern .
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;17	Otherwise , the whole thing is inexplicable . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0497;18	Summerton did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press on Thursday seeking comment on her resume discrepancies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;0	Ernesto Zedillo was sworn in as president Thursday , vowing to broker peace with Indian rebels , work for his country 's impoverished millions and phase out Mexico 's one-party rule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;1	As the 42-year-old economist was taking his oath of office , more than 10,000 people shouted slogans against him at a rally protesting his Institutional Revolutionary Party 's 65-year rule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;2	Rock-throwing protesters clashed with riot police , who responded by firing tear gas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;3	At least 50 people were injured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;4	Zedillo , who was honored with a parade by thousands of rifle-carrying soldiers backed by armored carriers , smartly saluted the army and navy marching bands as new commander-in-chief and 63rd president of Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;5	`` We want a homeland of peace , '' he declared in an inaugural address promising greater prosperity for all Mexicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;6	He took the oath of office at a simple midday ceremony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;7	Departing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari transferred over the green , red and white sash of the office before 1,500 dignitaries including U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Cuba 's Fidel Castro .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;8	The dignitaries were then taken in a caravan of gleaming black limousines to the National Palace , trailing Zedillo 's luxury car , guarded by jogging security agents and showered by confetti thrown from balconies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;9	`` We think he will be a good president ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;10	said Carmen Valencia , a 60-year-old housewife and exuberant ruling party supporter out for the national holiday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;11	`` He came from below and understands poverty . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;12	Protesters had a different message .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;13	`` Out with Zedillo ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;14	they shouted as they jammed the plaza surrounding the Monument of the Revolution commemorating Mexico 's bloody 1910-20 revolution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;15	They raised banners calling for a civil insurgency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;16	Later , hundreds marched toward the National Palace where Zedillo was greeting his new Cabinet and other supporters and were blocked by a barricade guarded by helmeted riot police .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;17	A Red Cross spokesman said about 50 people were injured when protesters threw rocks , bottles and other debris at police , who responded with tear gas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;18	Thick black smoke billowed in from of the National Lottery building as protesters set at least two vehicles ablaze -- a police jeep and an old truck owned by the ruling party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;19	Protesters threw rocks at firefighters trying to put out the flames .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;20	Many of the protesters were civil supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , a guerrilla force that rebelled on Jan. 1 in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;21	Others were backers of Mexico 's leftist Democratic Revolution Party , the biggest opponent to PRI rule and the free-market reforms Salinas undertook during his six years in office .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;22	Some residents were wary of the new administration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;23	The past year was marked by an unresolved Indian rebellion in Chiapas , the March 23 slaying of the first PRI presidential candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , kidnappings and drug feuds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;24	`` We are all a little bit skeptical , '' said taxi driver Juan Angel Mendoza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;25	`` They all say the same thing and nothing happens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;26	But who knows , maybe Zedillo will be different . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;27	The new president , who will guide Mexico until the year 2000 , promised to expand democracy and prosperity while stripping away many of the powers that have made presidential power nearly absolute .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;28	`` The time has come to do away with centralism , '' vowed Zedillo in the ceremony at the ornate Chamber of Deputies , the lower house of Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;29	Zedillo pledged to balance the power of the presidency with greater independence for the courts , the congress and state governments , as well as for his own party .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;30	Zedillo promised to launch a war on poverty and maintain a cease-fire with the Chiapas rebels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;31	`` Our most important challenge is to provide dignified living conditions for every Mexican family , '' he said , and vowed to use the free trade agreement with Canada and the United States `` to help generate the jobs we need and raise living standards . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;32	Bypassed once for his party 's presidential nomination , Zedillo was thrust into the campaign by Colosio 's assassination , the first major political killing in decades .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;33	He went on to win the presidency Aug. 21 in the most credible elections ever held in Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;34	Zedillo , former budget and planning minister under Salinas , is sure to continue his predecessor 's free-market economic policies -- a commitment underlined by the Cabinet choices announced Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;35	Leading negotiators of NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- were named heads of treasury , trade and foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;36	Seven other free-market economists also were named to the 25-person cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;37	Gore said 1994 was a year of `` unprecedented progress in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico ... and we look forward to even greater improvement in the year ahead . '
APW_ENG_19941201.0498;38	Zedillo also showed signs of a political opening with the appointment of a conservative opposition party member , Antonio Lozano , as attorney general .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;0	Draped in rubber armor , bristling with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' must be one of the Serbs ' oddest weapons in the Bosnian war .

APW_ENG_19941201.0499;2	The train , similar to those employed in both world wars , has three combat cars and three freight cars hooked to the front to protect it from mine blasts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;3	It chugs to the front line , aims and fires and then quickly retreats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;4	But on Tuesday , the train took a direct hit from a missile fired by Bosnian government defenders of Bihac , the U.N.-designated `` safe area '' in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;5	The 20-man crew survived and the damage was minor , since a thick rubber curtain absorbed most of the blast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;6	The car was loaded with ammunition and the train could have exploded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;7	`` We were lucky , '' said Djuro , whose shrapnel wound to the leg was the only injury .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;8	A hundred yards -LRB- meters -RRB- long , roofless and loaded with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' -- named for the Krajina region of neighboring Croatia -- is an example of the firepower Serbs are throwing at defenders of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;9	The United Nations says Croatian Serbs have joined the fighting in the Bihac area , helping anti-government forces corner the Bosnian army 's powerful 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;10	Serb troops say they are determined to punish the 5th Corps for an October offensive that routed them out of the Bihac region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;11	The Serbs counter-attacked in early November and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;12	`` The 5th Corps is in a desperate position and they will fight to the end , '' said Savo Bursac , who operates a 40mm anti-aircraft gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;13	`` I do n't expect them to surrender , and they have nowhere to go . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;14	He said the train crew never would have gotten involved had the 5th Corps not attacked Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;15	`` This is to teach them a lesson and to end the war . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;16	Capt. Blagoje Guska , commander of the train , said it had been fired upon but never hit before the missile attack Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;17	The train usually draws no fire and crew members blamed overconfidence for getting hit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;18	It rolled back quickly from the dangerous position south of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;19	`` That was our fault , '' said Djuro , who declined to give his last name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;20	`` We went too close and stayed there exposed for too long . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;21	The motor on a triple-barrel , anti-aircraft machine gun was destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;22	A small fire was quickly extinguished and Djuro got a lift to a nearby hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;23	Earlier , on its first of three runs that day , the train followed its standard procedure of appearing suddenly , firing its deadly barrage and quickly retreating .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;24	Approaching from the south , it halted about two miles -LRB- three kilometers -RRB- from Bihac and its guns joined the tank and howitzer fire on the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;25	The first shells were fired by a self-propelled cannon , aimed at what was said to be Bosnian army trenches on a remote hill .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;26	Then , missiles that had been taken off of jet fighters and refitted to the train were unleashed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;27	On its third raid , another anti-tank missile fired at the train hit a house about 200 yards -LRB- meters -RRB- away , setting it ablaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;28	The house was empty and there were no casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0499;29	Runs toward the government line are interspersed with breaks back at the train 's base about three miles -LRB- five kilometers -RRB- from Bihac .

APW_ENG_19941201.0501;33	` We are like family and we will be together till the end of this war , '' said Guska .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher confessed Thursday that the United States and its allies had mismanaged the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;1	He said they all had lessons to learn from the debacle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;2	As the NATO foreign ministers moved to expand NATO to countries in Central and Eastern Europe , Christopher found himself cast in the embarrassing role of explaining the Clinton administration 's decision to forgo force in favor of diplomacy to try to rein in the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;3	`` All of us ought to try to learn lessons from the experience in Bosnia , '' he told reporters , while trying to focus their attention on NATO 's future rather than the faltering attempt to quiet the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;4	Stoutly maintaining NATO had fulfilled the peacekeeping assignment given it by the United Nations , Christopher said the purpose in expanding the alliance and revamping the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , a 53-nation East-West group , was to forestall other threats to peace on the continent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;5	A senior U.S. official put it more bluntly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;6	`` While Bosnia is burning we are trying to concentrate on the larger structural issues that may prevent other Bosnias , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;7	NATO 's projected expansion eastward would embrace the territory between Germany and Russia , where two world wars were fought in this century .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;8	In Washington , Sen. George Mitchell , the outgoing Senate majority leader , indirectly chided his successor for second-guessing European allies over the Bosnia war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;9	`` It 's very easy for Americans to lecture our European allies on what should occur or should not occur on Bosnia , '' Mitchell told reporters on his last working day as majority leader .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;10	The remarks by the Maine Democrat came days after Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole , R-Kan. , the incoming majority leader , held tense meetings with officials in London and at NATO headquarters in Brussels over the Balkan war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;11	Dole declared the current U.N. peacekeeping effort a failure and said the peacekeeping force should withdraw .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;12	Dole stuck to his sharply critical stand in comments to reporters Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;13	`` There 's more and more feeling , I can tell you , for the -LRB- U.N. -RRB- protection forces to leave and to lift the arms embargo , '' Dole said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;14	`` It seems to me there is n't any U.S. policy in Bosnia right now . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;15	On Friday , Christopher intends to get formal approval from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;16	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;17	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;18	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made plans to fly to Belgrade next weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;19	Christopher 's aides said he did not intend to accompany them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;20	At the same time , NATO is considering contingency plans to withdraw the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in Bosnia , hundreds of whom have been detained by the onrushing Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;21	Christopher said an evacuation would require ground troops and the United States `` would have a role in that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;22	However , he said President Clinton had not decided specifically what American troops might do to extricate the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;23	Looking backward , Christopher faulted the United Nations for deciding in 1991-92 to deal with the conflict in Bosnia as a humanitarian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;24	`` NATO has done very well in what it was asked to do , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;25	And looking ahead , Christopher said the United States would not shrink from any new conflicts in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;26	`` We believe the United States should be involved in the resolution of such crises in the future , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;27	NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes defended the alliance he has just taken over .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;28	`` Before accepting a new peacekeeping mission coming from the United Nations or coming from the CSCE we will look very carefully to the conditions , to the roles of the game , before saying once again yes , '' the Belgian diplomat said at a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0502;29	At this juncture , `` on Bosnia we certainly are of one mind today , '' Claes insisted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;0	David Paul , convicted chairman of the failed CenTrust Bank , was sentenced Thursday to 11 years in prison for his part in the dlrs 1.7 billion collapse of the savings and loan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;1	Paul , 55 , was earlier convicted of 97 counts of racketeering and fraud in connection with the 1990 failure of CenTrust , the fourth-biggest banking collapse in U.S. history .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;2	The prosecution had recommended that Paul serve 17 to 22 years in jail , and the defense proposed a three-year sentence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;3	Earlier in the day , U.S. District Judge Donald Graham warned that he was concerned about Paul 's willingness to accept his guilt .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;4	Graham had the power to impose additional prison time if he believed Paul was balking at accepting guilt .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;5	`` There 's a danger there , '' said Graham .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;6	`` I have to decide acceptance of responsibility because I 'm concerned about that , so be forewarned . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;7	Graham tentatively set a dollar loss of dlrs 62 million from the crimes committed while Paul was running the biggest savings and loan in the Southeast and hobnobbing with celebrities and politicians in the fast-paced 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;8	The amount is the starting point for determining the length of a prison term in fraud cases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;9	The defense believes the bank had dlrs 938 million in revenues when it was seized in 1990 , while the prosecution has calculated a dlrs 371 million loss on junk bonds that were sold by regulators after the bank failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0503;10	Regulators attacked CenTrust 's extravagant spending on artwork , and other luxuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;0	Showing more contempt for U.N. authority , Bosnian Serb fighters have kidnapped more U.N. peacekeepers and tightened their stranglehold Thursday on the `` safe area '' of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;1	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said Bosnian Serb units crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers from an observation post Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;2	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , and the United Nations has n't heard from its soldiers since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;3	The observation post is now occupied by the Serbs , which allows them unimpeded movement of equipment and personnel from Serb-held parts of Croatia into Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;4	Serb rebels from the two countries have joined in an offensive to drive Muslim-led Bosnian government forces out of the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;5	The fall of Bihac would effectively unite Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia , and the strategic importance of the enclave prompted a warning Thursday from Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;6	`` Croatia will not wait for the fall of Bihac , '' Susak told reporters in the capital Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;7	`` We are monitoring the situation , and if Croatia 's judgment is that Bihac is about to fall , Croatia will intervene . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;8	Croatian forces could not get to Bihac without going through territory that Serbs seized in the 1991 Croatian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;9	Bosnian Serbs did agree to meet Friday with top U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;10	On Wednesday , they refused to meet U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali because he insisted talks be held in Sarajevo , capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina 's internationally recognized government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;11	The Serbs agreed to Friday 's meeting after Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , traveled to Pale for talks with Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;12	In addition to trying to calm fighting in the Bihac area , where Serbs forces have overrun Muslim villages , Rose is concerned about the fate of more than 400 of his soldiers being held by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;13	But after Rose 's talks in Pale , no narrowing of differences was evident to raise hopes of an end to the 31-month-long war , which has left 200,000 people dead or missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;14	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;15	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;16	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;17	An international peace plan the Serbs have rejected would give Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;18	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;19	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;20	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;21	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;22	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;23	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;24	Between May and October , Serbs allowed only a dozen to pass through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;25	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were running short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac , 90 miles northwest of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;26	Bosnian radio said Serbs intensified their attacks Thursday afternoon on government-held towns in the Bihac enclave .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;27	Hamdija Kabiljagic , the regional mayor , reported increased fighting along the perimeters of Bihac and shelling of the town itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;28	He accused the United Nations of deliberately downplaying the situation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;29	Elsewhere , Serbs hit two government buildings in downtown Sarajevo with anti-tank missiles , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;30	Sarajevo 's airport remained closed and the humanitarian airlift suspended , because Serbs had not given security guarantees for incoming planes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;31	In Brussels , Secretary of State Warren Christopher told NATO foreign ministers that the United States and its allies had mishandled the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;32	`` All of us ought to try to learn lessons from the experience in Bosnia , '' he told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;33	Christopher hopes to get formal approval Friday from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0504;34	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months , and an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;0	Researchers have isolated a genetic switch that separates the boys from the girls .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;1	It turns off the female in the human embryo and starts biological changes that eventually put hair on the chest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;2	Dr. Michael Weiss of the University of Chicago said the new study advances the understanding of the complex cascade that determines whether people are male or female and sheds new light on how this process can sometimes go awry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;3	In research to be published Friday in the journal Science , Weiss and his team use sophisticated imaging techniques to explore on an atomic level the biological pathway to manhood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;4	Their research report traces the development of maleness , from the turning on of the SRY gene , which is on the Y chromosome , to the work of another gene , called MIS , that removes the female parts of the original embryo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;5	Weiss said that science has long known that everybody at conception is female , but the precise biological mechanism that changes an embryo to male is still incompletely understood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;6	Solving the puzzle on molecular level may answer questions about other basic cellular changes , such as the development of cancer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;7	`` If we can understand the general switches involved in sex determination , then we could possibly relate that to other basic processes , such as how organs differentiate or how cancer arises , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;8	For the first weeks after conception , all mammal embryos start forming the basic female structures -- uterus , fallopian tubes and vagina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;9	`` The embryo destined to become a boy begins as a female , '' Weiss said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;10	`` It lays down first female structures and not male structures at a phase when the embryo looks like a recognizable mammal , with toes , fingers and eyes and a heart .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;11	This is 35 to 40 days into human gestation . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;12	After that , he said , a gene called SRY switches on to start the embryo on its way toward manhood .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;13	The new study shows that SRY also triggers the work of another gene , called MIS , that dissolves the female parts of the original embryo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;14	`` SRY is the master switch , '' said Weiss .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;15	`` For the first time we have shown that SRY can activate a male specific pattern of gene expression leading to activation of MIS , which is the key signaling molecule for half of the male pathway . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;16	Sex determination in mammals originates with the chromosome of the sperm that fertilizes the egg .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;17	Male sperm can carry one of two chromosomes , X or Y. The Y chromosome is the male element that carries the SRY gene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;18	The female egg has an X chromosome .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;19	If the egg is fertilized with the father 's X chromosome , then the embryo continues its development as a female .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;20	But if the egg is fertilized with Y , then the SRY gene sets off a series of changes that eventually creates a male .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;21	In experiments on embryonic mice , Weiss and his team used nuclear magnetic resonance images to show that the SRY gene sends chemical signals to the MIS gene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;22	The MIS gene then causes the nascent female organs in the embryo to disappear .
APW_ENG_19941201.0505;23	SRY also starts the growth of testicles , which , in turn , start making testosterone , the hormone that causes development of male characteristics -- the penis , masculine-like muscles and , eventually , facial hair .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;0	A shareholder has filed a lawsuit against Mellon Bank Corp. , alleging the bank 's losses from risky lending investments are being passed on to investors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;1	Matthew Grimes of Las Vegas filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court , two days after Mellon announced it will take a dlrs 130 million charge in the fourth quarter to prevent further losses from investments that went sour .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;2	The suit seeks compensation and damages for the company from Mellon 's directors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;3	Mellon spokeswoman Margaret Cohen said the Pittsburgh-based bank could n't comment on the suit because it had n't seen it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;4	The dlrs 130 million charge is being taken to protect clients at its Boston Co. subsidiary from losses on long-term fixed-rate securities that fell in value as interest rates rose .
APW_ENG_19941201.0506;5	The charge will reduce Mellon 's 1994 earnings by 88 cents per share , but the bank will still report a profit for the year and the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;0	Despite an intense lobbying campaign by the Cali cocaine cartel , Colombian lawmakers rejected a bill Thursday that would have made it easier for drug traffickers to keep their fortunes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;1	President Ernesto Samper opposed the bill , already passed by the Senate and a House committee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;2	In office only four months , Samper has been tainted by reports his election campaign received money from the Cali cocaine cartel .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;3	Passage of the so-called `` narcobill '' would have further damaged Samper 's credibility and made Colombia a pariah state to the United States and other nations fighting drug trafficking .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;4	The Cali cartel reportedly offered bribes to lawmakers to support the bill .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;5	It would have shielded them from prosecution for getting rich illegally , a technique prosecutors use when they ca n't catch drug kingpins actually making deals .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;6	The bill also would have forced authorities to shelve 800 pending cases of illicit enrichment against suspected traffickers , Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;7	`` We would have had to prove the crime of drug trafficking to later establish the illicit enrichment , which seems absurd because organized crime does not leave fingerprints , '' Valdivieso said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0509;8	Colombian drug kingpins , who supply 80 percent of the world 's cocaine , have largely eluded convictions for drug trafficking but have problems accounting for their fortunes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;0	A rebel Serb assembly met Thursday to endorse an economic agreement with Croatia , a move toward normalization despite artillery duels between the two sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;1	Croatia 's army and Serbs lobbed artillery shells at each other most of the past two days , said U.N. spokesman Paul Risley in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;2	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confronations since ending their six-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;3	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;4	Risley said artillery duels continued Thursday in the same area near Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , the self-proclaimed capital of Serb-held Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;5	But Croatian Serbs denied there was any serious trouble Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;6	Reporters in the Croatian port of Split , just west of Knin , saw unusual activity by Croatian army helicopters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;7	Bosnian Serb media claimed that regular Croatian army troops , backed by Bosnian Croats , had attacked Serb positions in Bosnia , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- northeast of Lake Peruca , across the border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;8	But the United Nations could not confirm that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;9	Croatia 's Defense Minister Gojko Susak denied his troops were involved in any fighting Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;10	But he suggested to reporters in Zagreb that the time was nearing to take up arms against rebel Serbs , who hold one-third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;11	`` Croatia today wants and can regain the territories , '' Susak said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;12	`` We have restrained so far . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;13	But he warned that `` in the next few months Croatia will have to do what every sovereign country would do to regain its territories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;14	Susak did not find such rhetoric incongruous with the economic agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;15	`` We are viewing this agreement as a step forward towards normalization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;16	But we are not going to wait endlessly for this to happen , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;17	Negotiations between the two sides on the economic agreement had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;18	But the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in Knin approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;19	Formal approval had not come by midnight but was expected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;20	Croatian authorities had already endorsed the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;21	The United Nations , in a statement , announced the agreement would be signed on Friday : by the Croats at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb in the morning , and by the Serbs at U.N. headquarters in Knin in the afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;22	It would be the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their six-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;23	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;24	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;25	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb areas , called the Krajina , into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;26	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since a tenuous cease-fire was reached in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0510;27	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;0	A jury convicted a Lebanese immigrant Thursday of murdering a Jewish teen-ager in an ambush on the Brooklyn Bridge , rejecting his claim that he was suffering a flashback from his childhood in war-torn Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;1	Rashid Baz , a livery cab driver , admitted he strafed a student van with bullets on March 1 as it drove onto the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;2	Sixteen year-old Aaron Halberstam was killed and three others were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;3	Baz 's lawyer , Eric Sears , blamed his client 's `` catastrophic '' childhood in Beirut , where he became a soldier at age 9 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;4	He said Baz suffers post-traumatic stress syndrome , which climaxed in the bridge shooting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;5	Baz , 28 , said he fired at the van after people in it mouthed insults and leveled a gun at him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;6	Nachum Sosonkin , 18 , a van passenger who was shot in the head and the most badly injured of three wounded survivors , testified at the trial that he never heard anyone inside the van say anything to Baz or display a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;7	The jury deliberated one day before convicting Baz of second-degree murder and 14 counts of attempted murder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;8	Baz , who immigrated from Lebanon at age 18 , faces 25 years to life at his Jan. 18 sentencing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;9	The shooting occurred as the 15 male students , dressed in the distinctive black garb worn by ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher Jews , returned from a visit to the Manhattan hospital where the Lubavitchers ' leader , Rebbe Menachem Schneerson , was being treated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0511;10	The prosecution cited testimony by Baz 's uncle , Jamal Akel , that Baz 's problems predated the start of Lebanon 's civil war in 1975 and much of his behavior was shocking -- even in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;0	Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval , who replaced former dictator Raoul Cedras as army commander , has been reassigned abroad as a military attache , a local radio station reported Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;1	Duperval , formerly Cedras ' second-in-command , was himself replaced Nov. 17 by an obscure firefighter , Brig. Gen. Bernardin Poisson , who was chosen as army chief by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;2	Poisson signed the order to transfer Duperval to Haiti 's diplomatic mission in Brazil , private Radio Quisqueya reported , citing an army source .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;3	The report also said Brig. Gen. Max Mayard was reassigned as military attache in Ecuador .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;4	While no officials at army heaquarters late Thursday would independently confirm the report , Aristide officials have expressed a desire to transfer overseas several senior officers in the 1991-4 military coup government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;5	Several other former members of the military high command have already been reassigned to military attache posts in Europe and South America .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;6	Mayard and Duperval were among four generals in the coup leadership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;7	The other two , Lt. Gen. Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby , resigned and fled into self-imposed exile in Panama two days before Aristide 's U.S.-backed homecoming on Oct. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;8	Aristide told supporters on Wednesday that he hoped to reform Haiti 's traditionally restive military , which he characterized as a `` cancer . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0512;9	He has pledged to slice the size of the army from 7,500 to 1,500 and to put policing duties under a new civilian police force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;0	Draped in rubber armor , bristling with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' must be one of the Serbs ' oddest weapons in the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;1	All aboard -- if you dare .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;2	The train , similar to those employed in both world wars , has three combat cars and three freight cars hooked to the front to protect it from mine blasts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;3	It chugs to the front line , aims and fires and then quickly retreats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;4	But on Tuesday , the train took a direct hit from a missile fired by Bosnian government defenders of Bihac , the U.N.-designated `` safe area '' in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;5	The 20-man crew survived and the damage was minor , since a thick rubber curtain absorbed most of the blast .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;6	The car was loaded with ammunition and the train could have exploded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;7	`` We were lucky , '' said Djuro , whose shrapnel wound to the leg was the only injury .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;8	A hundred yards long , roofless and loaded with guns , the `` Krajina Express '' -- named for the Krajina region of neighboring Croatia -- is an example of the firepower Serbs are throwing at defenders of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;9	The United Nations says Croatian Serbs have joined the fighting in the Bihac area , helping anti-government forces corner the Bosnian army 's powerful 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;10	Serb troops say they are determined to punish the 5th Corps for an October offensive that routed them out of the Bihac region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;11	The Serbs counter-attacked in early November and now control 30 percent to 40 percent of the area .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;12	`` The 5th corps is in a desperate position and they will fight to the end , '' said Savo Bursac , who operates a 40 mm anti-aircraft gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;13	`` I do n't expect them to surrender , and they have nowhere to go . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;14	He said the train crew never would have gotten involved had the 5th Corps not attacked the Serbs in Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;15	`` This is to teach them a lesson and to end the war . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;16	Capt. Blagoje Guska , commander of the train , said it had been fired upon but never hit before the missile attack Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;17	The train usually draws no fire and crew members blamed overconfidence for getting hit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;18	It rolled back quickly from the dangerous position south of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;19	`` That was our fault , '' said Djuro , who declined to give his last name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;20	`` We went too close and stayed there exposed for too long . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;21	The motor on a triple-barrel , anti-aircraft machine gun was destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;22	A small fire was quickly extinguished and Djuro got a lift to a nearby hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;23	Earlier , on its first of three runs that day , the train followed its standard procedure of appearing suddenly , firing its deadly barrage and quickly retreating .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;24	Approaching from the south , it halted about two miles from Bihac and its guns joined the tank and howitzer fire on the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;25	The first shells were fired by a self-propelled cannon , aimed at what was said to be Bosnian army trenches on a remote hill .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;26	Then , missiles that had been taken off of jet fighters and refitted to the train were unleashed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;27	On its third raid , another anti-tank missile fired at the train hit a house about 200 yards away , setting it ablaze .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;28	The house was empty and there were no casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;29	Runs toward the government line are interspersed with breaks back at the train 's base about three miles from Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;30	On one run back to the base , small trucks followed with hot soup and fresh bread for lunch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;31	Morale was boosted by a short visit from Bosnian Serb army deputy commander Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic , who is directing the Bihac campaign .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;32	Later , they sat around an open fire , playing accordion and singing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0513;33	` We are like family and we will be together till the end of this war , '' said Guska .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;0	Canada will wait patiently for the release of 55 Canadian peacekeepers detained by the Bosnian Serbs in the hope the international community will succeed in its latest bid to negotiate a settlement in Bosnia , Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;1	`` What is taking place is certainly not the ideal situation , '' said Ouellet after the first day of a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;2	`` Fortunately , our soldiers are not in danger more than they were before , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;3	`` They are well treated , they are able to move .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;4	We 've always thought the solution to the conflict -LRB- will not be found through -RRB- military force but through negotiations . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;5	Canada is backing renewed diplomatic efforts by the international contact group on former Yugoslavia made up of Russia , France , Britain , the United States and Germany .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;6	The contact group will meet in Brussels tonight to discuss a new diplomatic initiative that is expected to include the possibility of offering the Bosnian Serbs some form of confederation with Serbia itself in a bid to get the Serbs to the negotiating table .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;7	`` The -LRB- old peace -RRB- plan that has been proposed to the parties has not been totally accepted and has not allowed a peace process to materialize and be implemented , '' said Ouellet , defending the need to look at new approaches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;8	`` If we 're to be successful , a new round of consultation and contacts and efforts on the diplomatic front have to take place .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;9	We will be supporting these initiatives announced by the contact group in order to be more successful at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;10	Critics of the proposed confederation argue that it will reward the Bosnian Serbs by creating a greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;11	U.S. sources insist that any talk of a confederation will not deviate from the current proposed peace map for Bosnia that would give 51 per cent of Bosnia to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49 per cent to the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;12	Ouellet also echoed his fellow NATO ministers claims that the allied divisions over policy in Bosnia did not signal the inevitable breakdown of the alliance
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;13	The NATO ministers made a concerted attempt Thursday to present a united front and dispel the distrust that has plagued NATO ever since Washington last month unilaterally decided to stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;14	Britain and France in particular fear that Washington will further destablize NATO by succumbing to domestic pressure and calling for stronger military action to resolve the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;15	Ouellet said all members of the alliance have now agreed that more military action from NATO will not resolve the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0514;16	Canada , Britain and France , the largest contributors of troops to the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia , fear their troops could become targets of the warring factions in Bosnia if more force is used or an international arms embargo is lifted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0515;0	Rebel Serbs moved closer toward normalizing ties with Croatia late Thursday , approving an economic agreement despite reported artillery duels between the two sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0515;1	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly , meeting behind closed doors for nearly eight hours , approved the accord shortly before midnight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0515;2	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0515;3	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0515;4	It is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their six-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;0	Dan Quayle asked for -- and got -- a sandwich and a shower Thursday , and his doctor said the blood clots in the former vice president 's lung were dissolving rapidly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;1	Tests indicated the functioning of his right lung , where the clots had lodged , had improved , Dr. Homer L. Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;2	Quayle was being treated with a blood thinner at Indiana University Medical Center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;3	He is spending half his waking hours out of bed , a sure sign that he is improving , and could be released by Monday , Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;4	The 47-year-old Republican had been expected to announce within weeks whether he will seek the presidential nomination in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;5	He should be able to return to campaigning as long as he avoids sitting for long periods on airplane flights , Twigg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;6	That was probably how the clots developed , the doctor said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0516;7	`` His most urgent desire today is to take a shower , '' said Twigg , who added later , `` He 's asking for a Big Mac , '' a type of hamburger sandwich sold by the McDonald 's restaurant chain .

APW_ENG_19941201.0518;0	The United Nations , in a statement , announced the agreement would be signed on Friday : by the Croats at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb in the morning , and by the Serbs at U.N. headquarters in Knin in the afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;1	The diplomatic moves coincided with battlefield action .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;2	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;3	The artillery duels continued Thursday in the same area near Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , the self-proclaimed capital of Serb-held Croatia , said Paul Risley , another U.N. spokesman in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;4	But Croatian Serbs denied there was any serious trouble Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;5	Reporters in the Croatian port of Split , just west of Knin , saw unusual activity by Croatian army helicopters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;6	Bosnian Serb media claimed that regular Croatian army troops , backed by Bosnian Croats , had attacked Serb positions in Bosnia , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- northeast of Lake Peruca , across the border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;7	But the United Nations could not confirm that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;8	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confronations since ending their six-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;9	Croatia 's Defense Minister Gojko Susak denied his troops were involved in any fighting Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;10	But he suggested to reporters in Zagreb that the time was nearing to take up arms against rebel Serbs , who hold one-third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;11	`` Croatia today wants and can regain the territories , '' Susak said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;12	`` We have restrained so far . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;13	But he warned that `` in the next few months Croatia will have to do what every sovereign country would do to regain its territories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;14	Susak did not find such rhetoric incongruous with the economic agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;15	`` We are viewing this agreement as a step forward towards normalization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;16	But we are not going to wait endlessly for this to happen , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;17	Negotiations between the two sides on the economic agreement had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;18	But the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in Knin approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;19	Croatian authorities had already endorsed the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;20	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb areas , called the Krajina , into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;21	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since a tenuous cease-fire was reached in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0518;22	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .

APW_ENG_19941201.0522;0	Egyptian and U.S. students clashed Thursday on the campus of the American University in Cairo , and officials later said four Americans involved in the incident were leaving the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0522;1	Students and witnesses said the fight started after U.S. embassy officials arrived at the downtown campus to investigate an incident a day earlier near the campus in which four American students allegedly roughed up the Egyptian president of the Student Union , Mustafa Najam .
APW_ENG_19941201.0522;2	They said some 250 students gathered to demand that the diplomats leave the campus , shouting that they had no right to interfere in student affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0522;3	The diplomats were unable to leave until Egyptian police were summoned to break up the protesters , who also were shoving each other , they said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0522;5	At least two students , both believed to be Egyptians , were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of injuries , they said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0524;1	The rules , which still must be approved by maritime officials , were drafted in the wake of the Estonia ferry disaster , which sank Sept. 28 after its door locks failed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;2	More than 900 people died .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;3	Insurance companies and ferry lines at the time acted quickly to weld shut the doors and visors on ships .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;4	But only the Finnish government issued a blanket order for weldings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;5	The navigation authorities from Sweden , Finland , Norway and Denmark , meeting in Helsinki , agreed on rules that would require hinges on all ferries to be reinforced or replaced , the Swedish news agency TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;6	Inspectors had found the weak point to be locks and hinges , rather than the plates that hold them , said Joakim Heimdahl , an official from the Nordic Sea Navigation Board .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;7	`` In many cases , one can see certain sections need replacing or reinforcing , '' Heimdahl said , referring to ship inspections in the past two months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;8	Agreement by the navigation board was the first hurdle .
APW_ENG_19941201.0524;9	The proposals were referred to the Nordic Marine Safety Inspection Board , which meets Dec. 13 , TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;0	Michael Jackson is trying to end his 5-month-old marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , news reports in New York and London said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;1	But the official word from one half of the celebrity couple is that the reports are simply false .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;2	`` Once again , the media is being very irresponsible and spreading false rumors , '' Mrs. Jackson-Presley said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;3	`` Michael and I are very happily married .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;4	... These rumors , in spite of their wishful and destructive thinking , are totally unfounded and false . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;5	The separation speculation comes just after the couple 's six-month anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;6	Jackson biographer Christopher Andersen said he first heard rumors of a split on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;7	`` I had heard their lawyers were actually talking annulment , '' said the author of `` Michael Jackson Unauthorized . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;8	Lisa Marie and Michael were married in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic in May , but rumors about the marriage were n't confirmed until August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;9	Speculation that the marriage is at best a union of convenience and at worst a publicity ploy started immediately .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;10	`` Are Michael and Lisa Marie friends ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;11	Sure -- they 've been friends for a long time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;12	But that 's not a marriage , '' Andersen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;13	The current rumors come in several versions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;14	Andersen says the marriage was `` a scam '' from Day 1 , and now Lisa Marie wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;15	Gossip columnist Liz Smith intimates Michael viewed the nuptials as a `` public relations coup , '' but Lisa Marie fell in love and now Michael wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;16	Another Jacksonphile , author J. Randy Taraborrelli , blames the split on Lisa 's refusal to move to the East Coast and live with Michael in his Trump Tower apartment in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;17	Whatever the reason , it seems only a few people expect the Jacksons to be exchanging the traditional silverware on their 25th anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;18	Or , for that matter , paper on anniversary No. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;19	`` I did say the marriage would be over by the end of the year , '' Andersen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0525;20	`` Not that I want to say I told you so . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;0	Rebel Serbs moved closer toward normalizing ties with Croatia late Thursday , approving an economic agreement despite reported artillery duels between the two sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;1	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly , meeting behind closed doors for nearly eight hours , approved the accord shortly before midnight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;2	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;3	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220-mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;4	It is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their six-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;5	The United Nations , in a statement , announced the agreement would be signed on Friday by the Croats at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb in the morning , and by the Serbs at U.N. headquarters in Knin in the afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;6	The diplomatic moves coincided with battlefield action .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;7	On Wednesday , the Croatian army fired 33 shells at Serb-held territory over a six-hour period , U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;8	The artillery duels continued Thursday in the same area near Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.5 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , the self-proclaimed capital of Serb-held Croatia , said Paul Risley , another U.N. spokesman in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;9	But Croatian Serbs denied there was any serious trouble Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;10	Reporters in the Croatian port of Split , just west of Knin , saw unusual activity by Croatian army helicopters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;11	Bosnian Serb media claimed that regular Croatian army troops , backed by Bosnian Croats , had attacked Serb positions in Bosnia , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- northeast of Lake Peruca , across the border .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;12	But the United Nations could not confirm that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;13	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confronations since ending their six-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;14	Croatia 's Defense Minister Gojko Susak denied his troops were involved in any fighting Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;15	But he suggested to reporters in Zagreb that the time was nearing to take up arms against rebel Serbs , who hold a third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;16	`` Croatia today wants and can regain the territories , '' Susak said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;17	`` We have restrained so far . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;18	But he warned that `` in the next few months Croatia will have to do what every sovereign country would do to regain its territories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;19	Susak did not find such rhetoric incongruous with the economic agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;20	`` We are viewing this agreement as a step forward towards normalization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;21	But we are not going to wait endlessly for this to happen , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;22	Negotiations between the two sides on the economic agreement had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;23	But the Serbs ' self-styled government late Wednesday recommended that the assembly meeting in Knin approve the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;24	Croatian authorities had already endorsed the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;25	The deal , supported by powerful Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and drafted with the help of international negotiators , was viewed as a possible step toward the gradual reintegration of the Serb areas , called the Krajina , into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;26	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since a tenuous cease-fire was reached in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0526;27	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941201.0527;0	A ship carrying more than 400 people collided with a freighter and sank before dawn Friday , the Philippine coast guard reported .

APW_ENG_19941201.0532;0	Lucien Bouchard , a central and charismatic leader of Quebec 's separatist movement , had his left leg amputated Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;1	His emergency hospitalization throws into doubt the role the Bloc Quebecois leader will play in next year 's critical referendum on separation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;2	French-speaking Quebec has long sought some form of sovereignty or separation from the rest of Canada , which is largely English-speaking .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;3	Bouchard , 55 , was in serious but stable condition Thursday at Montreal 's Saint-Luc Hospital , where he was hospitalized Tuesday for a blood clot in his leg .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;4	Bouchard 's doctor , Patrick D'Amico , said in a statement that Bouchard developed an infection on his leg after being hospitalized .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;5	`` This situation necessitated two operations to drain and amputate the leg and control the infection , '' said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;6	Widely considered the most compelling Quebec separatist leader , the charismatic Bouchard 's absence from the upcoming referendum battle would be a blow to forces seeking Quebec 's secession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;7	Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau prevailed on Bouchard to show the same courage he has regularly displayed in the political arena .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;8	`` Our prayers are with you , '' said a shaken Parizeau .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;9	`` I hope this will soon be just a bad dream .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;10	Hold on old friend . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;11	A Bloc Quebecois spokesman refused to provide more details on Bouchard 's condition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;12	Bouchard is with him now , '' Marthe Lawrence , Bouchard 's spokesperson , said from the hospital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0532;13	`` The family wishes no further statement for the moment . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0534;0	Russia 's prisons are overcrowded and inhumane , with underfed inmates crammed into stinking , standing-room-only cells , a U.N. report said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;1	Conditions in pre-trial detention centers -- where first-time offenders accused of petty crimes can wait up to five years for a court appearance -- are even worse than labor camps for hardened convicts , the report said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0534;6	Rodley said the skyrocketing crime rate following the end of communist control has worsened already serious overcrowding in prisons .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;7	He criticized Russian authorities for responding to public concern about crime by throwing petty offenders into jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;8	He called on President Boris Yeltsin to issue a presidential decree releasing 71,000 non-violent , first-time offenders to ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;9	`` It 's a radical proposal because it 's a radical problem which needs to be addressed urgently , '' Rodley said at a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;10	He said beatings and maltreatment were widespread .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;11	`` The conditions are cruel , inhuman and degrading ; they are torturous , '' he wrote about cells in Moscow 's Butyrskaya prison .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;12	`` There is virtually no daylight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;13	There is insufficient room for everyone to lie down , sit down or even stand up at the same time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;14	Butyrskaya prison was constructed in 1771 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;15	Built for 3,500 prisoners , it now holds 6,300 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;16	`` The food , not always available because of the indebtedness of the institutions -- is primitive , of a fat-saturated soupy nature .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;17	It is consumed in the cell and is excreted in the cell , '' the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;18	In another Moscow detention center , Matrosskaya Tishina No. 1 , conditions in quarantine cells for sick prisoners were atrocious .
APW_ENG_19941201.0534;19	`` Despite the fact that several of the inmates had open , festering sores , severe fungal infections with decaying flesh , and extensive rashes , they reported that they had not seen a doctor in over a week , '' Rodley wrote .

APW_ENG_19941201.0547;3	Hundreds of Cubans have fled to this tiny British territory just 70 miles -LRB- 110 kilometers -RRB- south of Cuba since early August , when riots in Havana prompted Cuban President Fidel Castro to say he would not prevent people from leaving .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;4	The approximately 1,175 Cubans who remain represent about 4 percent of the 30,000 residents of this tourist resort and offshore banking center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;5	The local government is housing them in a tented camp and trying to persuade the United States to accept them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;6	The United States is already hosting thousands of Cubans in refugee camps .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;7	The Cubans here organized the march to ask for U.S. visas for the elderly and families with young children .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;8	The Caymans ' chief immigration officer was scheduled to brief the refugees Friday on the status of the territory 's talks with the United States and their immigration options , government spokeswoman Pat Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;9	The government has said it would screen all refugees and provide shelter to those who fled political persecution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;10	It said if the United States did n't accept the others , it would repatriate them as long as the Cuban government would guarantee their safety .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;11	After the screening , the Cayman government decided to grant asylum to a small , as-yet-undetermined number of political refugees , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;12	Twenty-four refugees have asked to return to their communist homeland and will be flown back , probably within the next two weeks , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;13	The Cuban government has assured that they will be given safe passage home , she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;14	The Caymans sent back nine Cubans who had asked to return in October .
APW_ENG_19941201.0547;15	Meanwhile , 55 British policemen arrived Wednesday to relieve local officers who have been working 12-hour shifts to guard the refugees .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;0	Queen Elizabeth II will visit South Africa in March , returning there for the first time since she made her 21st birthday broadcast from Cape Town in 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;1	As Princess Elizabeth , the queen accompanied her parents , King George VI , who died in 1952 , and Queen Elizabeth , now the 94-year-old Queen Mother , when they visited South Africa in 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;2	She turned 21 in Cape Town and broadcast from there , dedicating herself to the service of Britain and the now 51-nation Commonwealth of its former colonies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;3	As international hostility toward apartheid grew , no British sovereign subsequently visited South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;4	KINGSTON , Jamaica -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell , a child of Jamaican immigrants who worked his way up to become America 's military chief , returned Thursday to receive one of Jamaica 's highest honors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;5	His wife , Alma , his three children and two grandchildren watched as Governor-General Sir Howard Cooke draped a green sash with the insignia of the Order of Jamaica over Powell 's neck .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;6	The equivalent of a knighthood in the British system , the Order entitles Powell to be called `` The Honorable . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;7	It is the highest honor that can be given to non-Jamaicans .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;8	`` Every Jamaican , at home and in the diaspora , sees in your achievement the embodiment of the best in us and an indicator that nothing is beyond the capacity of the Jamaican people , '' Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;9	Patterson and others recounted Powell 's climb from a poor New York City neighborhood to Vietnam soldier , Army general , National Security Adviser , and chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;10	Even before Powell 's retirement from the military in September 1993 , he had been frequently mentioned as a possible contender for the presidency in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;11	LOS ANGELES -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford , who were married three years ago , have separated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;12	The couple announced their break-up in a statement issued Thursday by their public relations firm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;13	`` This personal and painful decision was made between us in July , '' they said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;14	`` Since that time we have been trying to work things out , but due to the recent conjecture in the press , we have decided to make a statement at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;15	Gere 's acting credits include `` An Officer and a Gentleman '' and `` Pretty Woman . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;16	Crawford , who gained fame as a model , is host of a U.S. television fashion show .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;17	NEW YORK -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The late Steve McQueen could have become another Spencer Tracy if he 'd lived long enough , says British actor-director Richard Attenborough .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;18	`` Of all the people of my acquaintance in acting , I miss -LRB- McQueen -RRB- more than anyone , '' Attenborough , 71 , says in an interview in the Dec. 4 Parade magazine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;19	`` If he had lived , as good as he was in pictures , I think Steve would have grown and become the new Tracy , perhaps , '' said Attenborough , who became close to McQueen while filming two adventure films , `` The Great Escape , '' and `` The Sand Pebbles . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;20	McQueen , 50 , died on Nov. 7 , 1980 , of a heart attack following surgery for cancer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;21	Attenborough 's five decades-plus in film and theater earned him a knighthood and a lordship .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;22	ROCK ISLAND , Ill. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Roseanne and Tom Arnold 's floating love nest is on sale now that their marriage has sunk .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;23	The boat , My Rosey , arrived in Rock Island on Wednesday after spending time in the waters of Lake Rathbun near Centerville , Iowa .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;24	Joe and Mary Wakeen , owners of Wakeen 's Family Boating Center Inc. , who originally sold the boat to the Arnolds , were asked to sell it again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;25	The Arnolds ordered the yacht in 1993 , paying dlrs 190,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;26	The 37-foot -LRB- 12-meter -RRB- yacht has a black and beige interior with television , stereo equipment , air conditioning and sleeping quarters for two .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;27	`` They wanted something to escape and get away from the crowds , '' Wakeen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;28	NEW YORK -LRB- AP -RRB- -- As a child , Natalie Cole grew up with the sounds of Nancy Wilson , Tony Bennett , Johnny Mathis and other pop and jazz greats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;29	But when the Beatles hit it big , she begged her father for their records .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;30	And what was Nat `` King '' Cole 's reaction to the Fab Four ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;31	`` He was a typical dad in that sense . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;32	she said in a recent interview .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;33	`` He just wanted to make sure that I was grounded in some other stuff .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;34	I 'm really glad that I was able to absorb Sarah -LRB- Vaughan -RRB- and Ella -LRB- Fitzgerald -RRB- at the same time I was absorbing Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles and Motown . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;35	The 44-year-old Cole will sing tunes from her new Christmas album , `` Holly and Ivy , '' on a U.S. Public Broadcasting System special Monday night .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;36	EASTON , Pa. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- It 's easy to find people willing to wrestle over dlrs 5,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;37	It 's even easier when the money comes as a check endorsed by Paul Newman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;38	The actor donated the money from his food company to the State Theatre at the suggestion of friend and fellow race-car driver , Mario Andretti .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;39	`` We do n't usually have everyone in the office fighting to touch the signature on the check , '' said Shelley Brown , the theater 's executive director .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;40	The money comes from Newman 's Own , which makes salad dressing , salsa , spaghetti sauce and popcorn .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;41	Newman donates all of the profits -- more than dlrs 50 million to date -- to charity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;42	Andretti , who recently retired from racing , has been a longtime supporter of the State Theatre .
APW_ENG_19941201.0549;43	Newman was Andretti 's guest at the reopening of the refurbished theater in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;0	Tons of food and donated goods from around the world are resupplying and fattening Rwanda 's exiled , genocidal Hutu regime as it plots a bloody return to power .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;1	The new government , meanwhile , is bankrupt , powerless and at the mercy of a world seemingly indifferent to its struggle to heal a shattered society and rebuild a nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;2	`` I 'm stumped .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;3	And I think it 's just scandalous , '' said Chris Hennemeyer of Catholic Relief Services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;4	`` Either there is a massive conspiracy to keep Rwanda down ... or the world community is incredibly incompetent . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;5	Whatever the intent , international actions since the holocaust began in this tiny Central African nation have consistently helped the killers : -- When Rwanda 's president , a Hutu , was killed in a suspicious plane crash April 6 and order collapsed , the United Nations withdrew most of its troops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;6	That freed the Hutu army and its affiliated militias to butcher an estimated 500,000 people , mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;7	-- In July , the Tutsi-led rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front toppled the remnants of the Hutu-dominated government , which promptly urged more than a million countrymen to flee with it into neighboring Zaire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;8	In the ensuing four months , relief groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to feed , shelter and care for the survivors and perpetrators of the bloodletting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;9	-- Of the dlrs 1.5 billion spent so far on the Rwanda crisis , dlrs 850 million has gone to help refugees outside the borders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;10	The millions earmarked for rebuilding in Rwanda are controlled by the aid organizations for chosen programs ; Rwanda 's bankrupt government is powerless to help itself .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;11	`` It 's so unfair .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;12	It 's so perverted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;13	It 's so disgusting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;14	You keep searching for an explanation , '' said Rakiya Omaar of African Rights , a London-based humanitarian group .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;15	Cruel explanations exist , of course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;16	The World Bank ca n't make a loan until the new government pays the old government 's outstanding debts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;17	Aid organizations are flush with donations from around the globe but are n't allowed to give humanitarian assistance to a partisan government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;18	Similarly , the U.N. World Food Program may not help feed the national army , which is unpaid and in danger of disintegrating into a thieving mob .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;19	But it does feed former soldiers and militiamen who control the refugee camps by stealing relief supplies and holding hostage many people who want to return to Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;20	`` The international community finds it easier to give largess , money , bounty to a humanitarian crisis because no one questions it , '' said Shaharyar Khan , the United Nations ' special envoy to Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;21	`` But due consideration needs to be given to getting the ship of state afloat again , too . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;22	Relief organizations `` respond better to a refugee situation -- it 's manageable , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;23	`` You do n't have to go into detailed explanations of who is responsible .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;24	You just get pictures of poor refugees dying of cholera and it 's very good for fund-raising . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;25	In the squalid camps around Goma , Zaire , cholera is largely conquered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;26	Malnutrition is a greater worry now as hard-eyed young men at ramshackle wooden stands sell sacks and cans of food clearly labeled as humanitarian donations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;27	Most of these merchants of purloined goods are believed to be members of the Hutu militias responsible for much of the ethnic carnage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;28	This relief travesty occurs because U.N. and private agencies merely deliver food to the camps .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;29	Its distribution is handled by the Hutu bosses , who use it to reward loyalists and punish those they label traitors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;30	Brenda Barton , spokeswoman for the World Food Program , estimates 25 percent of food sent to the camps is being pilfered and sold in the camps ' markets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;31	The camp leaders use other means of intimidation , too .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;32	Stabbed and beaten bodies are found in the camps almost daily ; aid workers blame Hutu leaders for the murders of dozens , perhaps hundreds , of people who have tried to go home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;33	Major aid agencies have threatened to pull out of the camps unless the United Nations provides protection for their workers , some of whom have been briefly kidnapped by Hutu thugs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;34	This week , the Security Council voted to keep 5,500 U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda until June 9 , 1995 , but delayed action on committing up to 5,000 troops for camp security until member nations could be consulted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;35	Referring to the thousands of defeated Hutu soldiers and militiamen living in camps near Goma , the council said it was `` alarmed at the indications that these groups and individuals may be preparing for an armed invasion of Rwanda . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;36	A few aid groups have bent the rules a little to get food to the Rwandan army and badly needed items to some ministries , Khan said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;37	`` It 's a drop in the ocean , '' said Christine Umutoni , Rwanda 's deputy rehabilitation minister .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;38	`` The international community should not just sit and watch .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;39	It 's like sitting and watching an invalid . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;40	In Kigali , the capital , where aid organizations file reports on computers and contact the outside world by satellite and radio telephones , Rwandan agencies scrounge for pencils and stationery .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;41	A small fleet of government vehicles disappeared with the retreating Hutu officials , who also looted the Central Bank .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;42	Rwanda 's new justice minister , who hopes to bring 30,000 Hutus to trial on genocide charges , works in a bullet-scarred office that is often without electricity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;43	The office has a single typewriter , no copying machine and a telephone that works so randomly it 's often impossible to call across town .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;44	After lobbying by Khan , several European nations recently pledged money to help the government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;45	To date , none has arrived .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;46	Last Friday , the European Union freed 45 percent of the dlrs 183 million it had set aside for Rwanda through 1995 -- but only dlrs 10 million went directly to the government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;47	Umutoni said some nations are making grants conditional on unrealistic demands , such as making the country safe for returnees and halting all reprisal killings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;48	But without money , she says , the government ca n't make improvements to lure people home , or train enough police to stop the killings or open the courts to try the killers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;49	An international war crimes tribunal is also months away , probably longer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;50	`` Sometimes I think people ask too much , '' Umutoni said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;51	Rwandans have been so traumatized , she said , that it would not be startling if there were still `` 1,000 people being killed everyday and their bodies floating in the river . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;52	`` If you do n't have a justice system , Rwandans will be tempted , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;53	`` Right now they hold themselves because they know the tribunal was promised .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;54	And , Umutoni added , she might have expected too much from the world .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;55	`` After what Rwanda went through , we expected help to be automatic , that people would just switch on .
APW_ENG_19941201.0551;56	I think they should know that Rwanda has gone through hell and needs immediate help . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;0	The Senate gave final congressional approval to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on a vote of 76-24 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;1	The House of Representatives had approved the accord on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;2	The Senate had voted 68-32 just minutes earlier to waive its own budget rules and remove a key procedural hurdle to passage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;3	Sixty votes were needed in the earlier vote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;4	Clinton , badly in need of a congressional victory to lift his battered fortunes following the November elections that gave opposition Republicans control of Congress , had worked throughout the day to convince wavering lawmakers to support the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;5	Retiring Democratic Leader George Mitchell noted that the vote was the last one to be taken by the 103rd Congress and the last he would ever take in the Senate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0552;6	He said he was proud that his last vote as a senator was `` on a matter that will have significance for generations to come . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;0	A ferry carrying close to 500 people collided with a freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , the Philippine coast guard reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;1	Radio station DZRH reported bodies floating in the water .
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;2	There was no immediate word whether a coast guard rescue effort was at all successful .
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;3	The Singapore-registered freighter , with a crew of 26 , did not sink , news reports said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;4	The ship sank near the town of Maragondon , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province near the mouth of Manila Bay .
APW_ENG_19941201.0553;5	The ship was coming from Tagbilaran , capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;0	Smokers are 50 percent more likely to suffer from impotence than nonsmokers , the U.S. government said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;1	Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the rate may be even slightly higher , because some men in the study may have been unwilling to acknowledge the sexual disorder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;2	`` It 's more bad news for smokers , '' said Dr. David Mannino of the CDC 's National Center for Environmental Health .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;3	Researchers estimate that up to 10 million U.S. men are impotent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;4	Smoking had long been suspected as a factor , along with diet , diabetes , aging , alcohol and medication .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;5	The study was based on a survey of 4,462 U.S. Army Vietnam veterans between the ages of 31 and 49 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;6	Of that number , 1,162 said they never smoked ; 1,292 said they were former smokers ; and 2,008 said they currently smoked .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;7	Among nonsmokers , 2.2 percent said they suffered persistent impotence , compared to 2 percent of former smokers and 3.7 percent of current smokers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;8	Researchers said the difference in the rate of impotence reported by nonsmokers and former smokers was statistically insignificant .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;9	There would be a 68 percent difference in the rate of impotence reported by smokers and nonsmokers except that Mannino said the risk dropped to 50 percent when other factors such as drug abuse , race , age and vascular disease were taken into account .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;10	The report , published in the December issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology , is the first to show that smoking alone is a risk factor for impotence , said Dr. Robert J. Krane , head of Boston University Medical Center 's urology department .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;11	Krane was among a group of researchers trying to examine a possible link between smoking and impotence in men over age 50 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;12	Most cases of impotence occur among older men .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;13	He said it was particularly striking that the survey participants were younger men .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;14	`` It 's quite impressive that we see a difference in this younger age group , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;15	Mannino said the study did not examine why smoking could lead to impotence , but earlier research has shown that smokers are more likely to develop vascular disease , which plays a role in sexual dysfunction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;16	`` You need good blood vessels to maintain an erection , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;17	Other evidence points to the numerous compounds in cigarette smoke , such as carbon monoxide , which can relax the blood vessels or affect the nervous system and thus prevent an erection .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;18	Neither years spent smoking nor the number of cigarettes smoked daily appeared to predict whether a smoker would be impotent , but Mannino said that could change as the men age .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;19	`` This is in relatively young men , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0554;20	`` They may develop more of a problem '' as they continue to smoke .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;0	About 50 Dominican prisoners ordered released by the courts but still behind bars rioted Thursday , burning mattresses and clothes in a call to be let out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;1	No injuries were reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;2	`` We want justice , we want liberty , '' shouted the inmates at the La Victoria prison 14 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- north of the capital city .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;3	The eight-hour uprising was quelled only when police sprayed about 20,000 gallons -LRB- 76,000 liters -RRB- of water into the cells and the country 's Human Rights Commission president , Virgilio Almanzar , asked the inmates to stop .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;4	Santo Domingo prosecutor Alexis Joaquin Castillo was scheduled to meet with the inmates Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;5	An estimated 130 of La Victoria 's 4,000 prisoners were declared innocent or ordered released by the courts months ago , but they remain in jail .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;6	Some were jailed only on the orders of police , with no charges against them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;7	Human rights groups and the inmates ' families have demanded the release of the prisoners , known locally as `` the disrespected . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;8	President Joaquin Balaguer has said the prisoners should remain behind bars , arguing that the decisions to release them were tainted by corruption .
APW_ENG_19941201.0555;9	He created a committee to review the cases .

APW_ENG_19941201.0556;1	Street beat Canadian Kate Pace by 31-hundredths of a second on the third day of training .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;2	Street , who coasted through the finish and nonchalantly missed the final gate , was timed in 1 minute , 45.66 seconds as the 26th starter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;3	For the first time , downhillers in the top seed of 15 can select their starting numbers from 1 through 30 , and most of the favorites chose numbers in the 20s for the training runs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;4	Pace , who won the 1993 world championship downhill , had a time of 1:45.97 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;5	Anja Haas of Austria was third at 1:46.02 , followed by Olympic champion and defending World Cup downhill titlist Katja Seizinger of Germany at 1:46.03 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;6	Switzerland 's Chantal Bournissen , who led the first training run Tuesday , was fifth at 1:46.46 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;7	Melanie Suchet of France was sixth at 1:46.55 , and Swiss veteran Heidi Zeller-Baehler , winner of the giant slalom in the season-opening races last weekend , was seventh at 1:46.56 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;8	Street said she `` went way wide '' on a turn in the top part of the course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;9	`` But I carried my speed OK through there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;10	I took a pretty tight line after that and things were coming at me faster , but I was ready for it . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;11	`` The course probably wo n't be a whole lot faster tomorrow , '' Street said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;12	`` It will be a matter of who can clean up their mistakes and find a couple more tenths . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;13	Pace was pleased with her result , after placing ninth and 13th in the two previous training runs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;14	`` Finally , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;15	`` I have n't been able to follow my game plan because of the loose snow on the course , but there was no loose snow or fresh snow overnight , and the course was perfect today . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;16	Hilary Lindh of Juneau , Alaska , the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in downhill who posted her first World Cup win last February , was 17th in 1:47.02 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;17	`` I think I can do better , '' Lindh said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;18	`` I 've never done well here .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;19	Certain people have courses they do well on , and this does n't happen to be one of mine .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;20	I 've always had a hard time on the turns at the bottom . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;21	Canada 's Melanie Turgeon , leader on the second day of training , finished a distant 42nd at 1:48.35 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0556;22	Friday 's downhill race will be followed by a super-G Saturday and a giant slalom Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;0	On the crucial budget waiver vote , the accord was supported by 31 Republicans and 37 Democrats and was opposed by 15 Republicans and 17 Democrats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;1	Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole said his office was still getting up to 2,000 calls a day protesting the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;2	Dole said he had decided to support agreement , even with its flaws , because the alternative of defeat would be far worse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;3	`` The bottom line is we just ca n't isolate ourselves from the rest of the world , '' Dole said before the Senate began voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;4	The 124-nation trade agreement cuts tariffs by an average of 38 percent worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;5	For the first time , it extends GATT rules to such new areas as reduction of trade-distorting agriculture subsidies , lowering trade barriers in service industries such as banking , and clamping down on copyright piracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;6	It also creates a more powerful World Trade Organization to referee trade disputes and eliminates the one-country veto that a losing nation could use to block an adverse ruling .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;7	Supporters said the agreement , by cutting the border taxes Americans have to pay while at the same time lowering barriers U.S. businesses and farmers face overseas , would provide a tremendous boost to the U.S. economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;8	The Clinton administration estimated this would create a half-million new jobs and mean an annual increase of dlrs 150 billion in U.S. economic growth a decade from now , when the deal is fully implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;9	That extra growth would put dlrs 1,700 more a year in the pockets of the average American family , the administration said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;10	However , opponents charged that the WTO represented a dangerous encroachment on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;11	They said that seven previous GATT negotiating rounds to lower trade barriers have not cured America 's chronic trade deficit nor stopped the hemorrhage of manufacturing jobs overseas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;12	They warned that in textiles alone , one of America 's most protected industries , 1 million jobs could be lost .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;13	`` We are not leading in world trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;14	We are losing , '' Sen. Ernest Hollings , a Democrat from South Carolina , a leading textile state , said during floor debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;15	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;16	Everybody knows that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;17	The administration was anxious for a healthy bipartisan victory margin as a way to show that a Democratic White House will be able to work next year with the first Republican-controlled Congress in four decades .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;18	The Senate vote followed a surprisingly large 142-vote margin of victory in the House on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;19	Before the congressional action , only 36 other nations had approved GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;20	But many other nations were simply waiting to see what the United States did .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;21	The agreement is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;22	The debate over the WTO came during the first outgoing session of Congress in 12 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;23	It was forced by Hollings , who used his power as a chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to block a vote before the November elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0557;24	A diverse group of opponents worked down to the wire to defeat the deal , taking out newspaper ads and mobilizing opponents to telephone lawmakers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;0	Rebel Serbs approved an economic agreement with Croatia 's government Thursday , but they still hurled artilery shells at each other .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;1	The agreement calls for resuming water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway connecting Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;2	Two sections of the 220 mile highway are controlled by Croatian Serb rebels .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;3	It is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;4	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;5	Croatian authorities had already approved the deal , which was crafted with the help of international negotiators .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;6	The two sides will not meet face to face to sign the deal Friday , the United Nations said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;7	The Croats will sign it at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb in the morning while the Serbs will sign at U.N. headquarters in Knin , their capital , in the afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;8	The diplomatic moves coincided with battlefield action .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;9	Artillery duels continued Thursday near Lake Peruca , about 19 miles southeast of Knin , said Paul Risley , a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;10	Croatian Serbs denied there was any serious military action Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;11	Reporters in the Croatian port of Split , just west of Knin , saw unusual activity by Croatian army helicopters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;12	The two sides have had thousands of skirmishes and larger confronations since ending their six-month war with an uneasy , U.N.-patrolled truce in January 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0559;13	Croatia 's Defense Minister Gojko Susak said his troops may soon attempt to regain territory from rebel Serbs who control one-third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;0	More than 300 Cuban women and children who came here as refugees marched peacefully through the capital Thursday , urging the United States to let them into the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;1	`` We are in this country because we fled from Cuba , a place without hope where the words ` war ' and ` hate ' are constantly in schools , books and television , '' one of the children said in a speech in front of the main government building .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;2	`` We want to know this world which promises a future full of hope , '' the child said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;3	Hundreds of Cubans have fled to this tiny British territory just 70 miles -LRB- 110 kilometers -RRB- south of Cuba since early August , when riots in Havana prompted Cuban President Fidel Castro to allow people to leave .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;4	About 1,175 Cubans are living in this tourist resort and offshore banking center .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;5	The local government is housing them in a tented camp and trying to persuade the United States to accept them .
APW_ENG_19941201.0561;6	The Cubans here organized the march to ask for U.S. visas for the elderly and families with young children .
APW_ENG_19941201.0562;0	An unmanned Ariane rocket carrying a U.S.-made communications satellite crashed into the Atlantic Ocean 15 minutes after takeoff Thursday due to third-stage engine failure .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;0	Bosnian Serb fighters tightened their stranglehold on the `` safe area '' of Bihac , but agreed to meet Friday with the top United Nations envoy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;1	Bosnian Serbs were to meet with chief U.N. representative Yasushi Akashi in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;2	On Wednesday , they refused to meet U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali because he insisted talks be held in Sarajevo , capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina 's internationally recognized government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;3	The Serbs agreed to Friday 's meeting after Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , traveled to Pale for talks with Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;4	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said Thursday that Bosnian Serb units crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers from an observation post Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;5	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory , and the United Nations has n't heard from its soldiers since .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;6	The observation post is now occupied by the Serbs , which allows them unimpeded movement of equipment and personnel from Serb-held parts of Croatia into Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;7	Serb rebels from the two countries have joined in an offensive to drive Muslim-led Bosnian government forces out of the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;8	The fall of Bihac would effectively unite Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia , and the strategic importance of the enclave prompted a warning Thursday from Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;9	`` Croatia will not wait for the fall of Bihac , '' Susak told reporters in the capital Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;10	`` We are monitoring the situation , and if Croatia 's judgment is that Bihac is about to fall , Croatia will intervene . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;11	Croatian forces could not get to Bihac without going through territory that Serbs seized in the 1991 Croatian war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;12	In addition to trying to calm fighting in the Bihac area , where Serbs forces have overrun Muslim villages , Rose is concerned about the fate of more than 400 of his soldiers being held by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;13	But after Rose 's talks in Pale , no narrowing of differences was evident to raise hopes of an end to the 31-month-long war , which has left 200,000 people dead or missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;14	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;15	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;16	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;17	An international peace plan the Serbs have rejected would give Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;18	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;19	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;20	Continuing the squeeze on the Bosnian government , Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the Bihac enclave and other vulnerable U.N.-patrolled sites with food and supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;21	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;22	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;23	The last UNHCR food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;24	Between May and October , Serbs allowed only a dozen to pass through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;25	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said food and fuel supplies for peacekeepers were running short in the government-held eastern Bosnian enclaves , as well as Bihac , 145 kilometers -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- northwest of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0563;26	Bosnian radio said Serbs intensified their attacks Thursday afternoon on government-held towns in the Bihac enclave .

APW_ENG_19941201.0565;0	The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved and sent to President Clinton the historic 124-nation GATT trade agreement that will slash tariffs worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;1	The Senate gave final congressional approval Thursday night to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on a vote of 76-24 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;2	The House of Representatives had approved the accord on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;3	The Senate had voted 68-32 just minutes earlier to waive its own budget rules and remove a key procedural hurdle to passage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;4	Sixty votes were needed in the earlier vote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;5	Clinton , badly in need of a congressional victory to lift his battered fortunes following the November elections that gave opposition Republicans control of Congress , had worked throughout the day to convince wavering lawmakers to support the deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0565;6	Retiring Democratic Leader George Mitchell noted that the vote was the last one to be taken by the 103rd Congress and the last he would ever take in the Senate .

APW_ENG_19941201.0567;0	Chechnya has been a thorn in Russia 's side since the early 19th century , when the Russian Empire rapidly expanded through the Caucasus Mountains , gobbling up small countries and ethnic enclaves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;1	Many of the small nations gave in , thankful for Russian protection against hostile neighbors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;2	In the Russian mind , Chechnya still evokes images of warriors , savages and criminals -- and also victims of Russian and Soviet persecution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;3	There is a religious divide as well ; Chechens are Muslims , Russians Christians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;4	For 50 years , the Chechens held out against Russian domination , capitulating in 1859 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;5	The dark-haired mountaineers often existed by raiding their neighbors for food , and Russian military camps quickly became targets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;6	In one well-known poem that is required reading in many Russian schools , poet Mikhail Lermontov referred to `` the evil Chechen -LRB- who -RRB- crawls up the bank '' of the Terek River .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;7	After the Chechen surrender , Russian Cossacks were encouraged to settle nearby to work the fertile lands and keep the peace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;8	But the fragile balance between Russian and Chechen was shattered under dictator Josef Stalin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;9	He first dispersed the Cossacks in an early purge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;10	Then , during World War II , he accused Chechens of supporting the Nazis and deported the entire nation , sending almost 400,000 people to Central Asia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;11	When they were allowed to return after Stalin 's death , Chechens found their homes destroyed and their land seized by former neighbors , mostly Russians or Ossetians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;12	Only Soviet repression kept the ethnic conflict from boiling over .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;13	With the Soviet breakup , age-old hostilities have flared again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;14	The capital , Grozny , has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;15	Russian troops are stationed in neighboring Ossetia and Ingushetia , but Chechnya has told Moscow to stay away .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;16	Russia on Thursday backed off from a threat to send troops after Chechnya defied a Russian ultimatum and called on armed volunteers to defend the capital .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;17	Air attacks continued on the outskirts of Grozny on Thursday , claiming at least a few civilian lives .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;18	And a Russian delegation arrived from Moscow and began talks with Chechen officials .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;19	Meanwhile , residents continued to flee the mainly Muslim city of 300,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;20	As Chechen clans fight each other ; the region 's industries have come to a standstill , and living standards have plunged .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;21	Crime is up , and Russians say it is spilling out of Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;22	They accuse Chechens of stealing cattle and cars from nearby Cossack villages .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;23	In Moscow , police say Chechen mafia clans are among the strongest , and avoid arrest by hiding in Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;24	Then this summer , there was a string of hostage-takings in southern Russia , some carried out by Chechen gunmen who tried to escape into Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;25	In July , when several terrorists hijacked a busload of people near the border , Dudayev said Russian police would not be allowed to follow if they tried to escape to Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;26	Russian police then tried to seize the terrorists before they could escape , and four hostages were killed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;27	`` Chechens ... are fiercely independent and aggressive , like ancient Vikings , '' said Vasily Varenik , a historian in Rostov-on-Don .
APW_ENG_19941201.0567;28	`` It wo n't be easy to find a solution . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;0	While the United Nations deliberates whether to continue operations in Bosnia , the Bosnian Serbs basically have decided the issue .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;1	They 've virtually closed the mission down .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;2	Consider : -- Delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians is basic to the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;3	But Bosnian Serbs have refused to approve convoys through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;4	-- Sarajevo depends on the U.N. airbridge for 80 percent of its supplies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;5	For more than a week , the up-again , down-again airlift has not flown because the Serbs refuse to approve flights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;6	To reinforce the message , the Serbs deployed surface-to-air missiles in the air corridor approaching Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;7	-- More than 400 peacekeepers , including French , British , Dutch , Canadians and Ukrainians , have been taken hostage against future NATO strikes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;8	Apart from delivering humanitarian aid , the U.N. mission is supposed to enforce agreements , such as those on removal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area and on protection of U.N. `` safe areas . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;9	Those military functions have been severely curtailed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;10	The United Nations is unable even to get permission from the Bosnian Serbs to resupply its own units in isolated Muslim enclaves such as Bihac and Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;11	Most of the detained peacekeepers were guarding collection points in the Sarajevo area , where Bosnian Serbs stored heavy guns after last February 's NATO ultimatum to remove such weapons from within 20 kilometers -LRB- 12.5 miles -RRB- of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;12	Both the Bosnian Serb and government forces routinely have put banned weapons in the zone .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;13	Apart from bluff and bluster , the U.N. has found no tools to force compliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;14	Last week , Bosnian Serb soldiers simply drove up to the nine collection points and surrounded them , trapping the peacekeepers inside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;15	The presence of U.N. hostages virtually guarantees no NATO air strikes to follow three last week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;16	U.N. relations with both sides have been touchy , and are getting worse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;17	The Serbs are in a position to punish the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;18	Sources who attended a U.N. staff meeting Thursday quoted the commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , as saying that the Bosnian Serbs `` have declared war '' on the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;19	On Wednesday , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the Sarajevo airport .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;20	Boutros-Ghali had come to Sarajevo to warn the two sides that the United Nations might pull out of Bosnia-Herzegovina entirely if they did not cooperate with the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;21	U.N. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , say they fear the Bosnian Serbs have decided to step up harassment in hopes the U.N. packs up and leaves .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;22	During the past 21\/2 years , the United Nations has faced similar periods of harassment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;23	But spokesman Thant Myint-U described the current level of hostility as unprecedented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;24	`` While we will certainly continue operations throughout the country in fulfillment of our various mandates as best we can , this unprecedenteian Serb party is certainly not making our jobs any easier , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;25	Thant said the level of harassment is so intense andust have been approved at the highest level , presumably by Karadzic and his military chief , Gen. Ratko Mladic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0568;26	Since all UNroval of the warring sides , absence of cooperation means the mission grinds to a halt .

APW_ENG_19941201.0570;1	The dollar started trading at 99.40 yen , up 0.39 yen from Thursday 's close and also above its overnight New York finish at 99.4 yen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0570;2	The dollar 's strength followed its advance on Thursday in New York , where the currency gained to a seven-week high as a spate of strong economic figures provided expectations of a further rise in key U.S. interest rats .

APW_ENG_19941201.0570;10	The yen 's weakness against the dollar was a supportive factor to the stock market , while an overnight fall on Wall Street remained a negative factor , dealers said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0573;0	The first two stages fired perfectly and the rocket lifted off at 7:38 p.m. -LRB- 2238 GMT -RRB- on schedule .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;1	Technicians confidently expected another of what have become almost routine shots .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;2	The third stage also lit properly , but mysteriously sputtered and went out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;3	Ariane officials said that the third stage was a new type using a new oxygen-hydrogen mixture to maximize performance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;4	The failure indicated continuing trouble in the third stage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;5	During the 63rd Ariane launch on Jan. 24 , a turbo-pump failure in the third-stage froze the rocket motor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;6	Ground controllers destroyed the launch in mid-flight , breaking a string of 26 faultless launches .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;7	Six subsequent flights this year have gone off without mishap .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;8	Thursday 's rocket took down with it a 2,985-kilogram -LRB- 3.3-ton -RRB- PanAmSat-3 telecommunications satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications in El Segundo , California .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;9	Belonging to PanAmSat of Greenwich , Conn. , the satellite would have channeled telephone , fax and television communications for most of North and South America , Europe and Africa over 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0573;10	It would have traveled in geostationary orbit over the mid-Atlantic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;0	An inter-island ferry carrying more than 500 people collided with a freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , the Philippine Navy reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;1	Reports said some of the passengers were rescued , but the numbers ranged widely .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;2	ZZRH , a private radio station , said the coast guard had rescued 18 people while station ZZMM said more than 200 were saved .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;3	`` We were sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;4	Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;5	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;6	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' said survivor Erwin Maravilla .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;7	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;8	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;9	He was one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol and brought to Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;10	The Singapore-registered freighter , the Cota Soria , with a crew of 26 , was engaged in the rescue effort , reports said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;11	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;12	`` We can not say if there are any casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;13	We do not want to assume there are casualties , '' said navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Anselmo Cabingan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;14	At least eight patrol boats and a search and rescue ship have were trying to rescue the 495 passengers and 14 crew who were aboard the ferry , the Cebu City , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;15	There was no immediate cause reported for the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;16	The ferry sank 30 minutes after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;17	The Cebu City sank near the mouth of Manila Bay near the town of Maragondon , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941201.0574;18	It was coming from Tagbilaran , capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;0	Russia stunned a NATO meeting by protesting plans to give membership to East European nations and backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;1	Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev was expected Thursday to endorse the plan approved just hours earlier by NATO foreign ministers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;2	Instead , he criticized it , saying the decision to draw up conditions for future NATO membership would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;3	His comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;4	However , some diplomats said they believed that he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;5	In an effort to overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , the NATO allies had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;6	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;7	Afterward , Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;8	Kozyrev refused to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow intended to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;9	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;10	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said in impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;11	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;12	U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning that he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;13	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;14	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , tried to reasssure Kozyrev that NATO was n't shifting direction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;15	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;16	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian minister just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;17	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;18	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;19	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;20	In an effort to heal the wounds , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;21	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;22	NATO has been anguishing in recent years over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in central and eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;23	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;24	In an effort to meet their demands , but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;25	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;26	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941201.0575;27	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;0	A jury convicted a Lebanese immigrant Thursday of murdering a Jewish teen-ager in an ambush on the Brooklyn Bridge , rejecting his claim that he was suffering a flashback from his childhood in war-torn Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;1	Rashid Baz , a livery cab driver , admitted he strafed the van with bullets on March 1 as it drove onto the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;2	Sixteen year-old Aaron Halberstam was killed and three others were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;3	Baz 's lawyer , Eric Sears , blamed his client 's `` catastrophic '' childhood in Beirut , where he became a soldier at age 9 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;4	He said Baz suffers post-traumatic stress syndrome , which climaxed in the bridge shooting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;5	Baz , 28 , said he fired at the van after its passengers mouthed insults and leveled a gun at him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;6	`` Let him rot in hell , '' Devorah Halberstam , the dead boy 's mother , said after the verdict .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;7	Nachum Sosonkin , 18 , a passenger who was shot in the head , testified during the trial that he never heard anyone inside the van say anything to Baz or display a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;8	The jury deliberated one day before convicting Baz of second-degree murder and 14 counts of attempted murder .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;9	Baz , who immigrated from Lebanon at age 18 , faces 25 years to life in prison at his Jan. 18 sentencing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;10	`` Nobody believed he was insane .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;11	The evidence was overwhelming that he was not .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;12	... I honestly believe his only remorse is that he did n't kill every single boy in that van , '' Mrs. Halberstam said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;13	The shooting occurred as 15 male students , dressed in the distinctive black garb worn by ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher Jews , returned from a visit to a Manhattan hospital where the Lubavitchers ' leader , Rebbe Menachem Schneerson , was being treated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;14	The rebbe died in June .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;15	The dead boy 's father , Rabbi David Halberstam , said he believes Baz acted to revenge the Feb. 25 massacre on Israel 's West Bank in which a Jewish settler killed 29 Arabs as they prayed in a mosque .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;16	Baz 's attorney had argued that the shooting was not revenge , but that the massacre might have triggered a deadly flashback .
APW_ENG_19941201.0576;17	The prosecution cited testimony by Baz 's uncle , Jamal Akel , that Baz 's problems predated the start of Lebanon 's civil war in 1975 and much of his behavior was shocking -- even in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;0	Russia stunned a NATO meeting by protesting plans to give membership to East European nations and backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;1	Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev was expected Thursday to endorse the plan approved just hours earlier by NATO foreign ministers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;2	Instead , he criticized it , saying the decision to draw up conditions for future NATO membership would create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;3	His comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;4	However , some diplomats said they believed that he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0577;5	In an effort to overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , the NATO allies had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .

APW_ENG_19941201.0578;0	A year after drug kingpin Pablo Escobar died in a shootout with police , his 10-year-old daughter says she still weeps for him and asks `` Why did you leave me all alone ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;1	Escobar , the Medellin cocaine cartel leader who ordered hundreds of the deaths , was nonetheless a devout family man .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;2	Police tracked him down by tracing calls he made to his family as he tried to help them flee a death squad .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;3	As he was making one of the calls on Dec. 2 , 1993 , police stormed into his Medellin hideout .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;4	Escobar , a pistol in each hand , fled onto the red-tile roof and was cut down by a fusillade of police bullets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;5	To mark the anniversary of Escobar 's death , his wife , son and daughter sent a card and a bouquet of fragrant dried flowers by courier Thursday to The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;6	In the card was a photograph of Escobar being kissed by his wife and daughter as his son looked on .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;7	`` On that December 2 you left me alone in a pitiless winter where sadness abounds , '' wrote his wife , Victoria Henao de Escobar .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;8	`` You left when I most needed your strength , which your gaze gave me .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;9	To bear living without you , your strength will become my strength . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;10	Escobar had doted on his daughter , Manuela Escobar , a black-haired girl whose hearing was permanently damaged in a bomb attack against Escobar .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;11	In the card , Manuela told her dead father she had learned to ride horses and was deeply pained he could not be there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;12	`` Why , poppy ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;13	Why did it happen ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;14	Why did I lose you ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;15	Why did you leave me all alone ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;16	As I say goodbye I am crying for you . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;17	Juan Pablo Escobar , 17 , wrote that he hoped to be united with his fathers ' spirit after he dies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;18	Unlike the family , most Colombians remembered Escobar 's death with relief .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;19	In his attempt to dictate policy to the government , Escobar allegedly ordered the assassinations of presidential candidates , justice ministers , judges and police .
APW_ENG_19941201.0578;20	The drug lord , among the world 's richest men and most wanted criminals , also waged a terrorist war against ordinary citizens , planting car bombs in shopping centers and residential neighborhoods that killed and maimed hundreds of people .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;0	A record 45 nations have submitted entries for best foreign-language film Oscar , the highest honor bestowed by the American motion picture industry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;1	The previous record was set in 1990 when 37 countries submitted films .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;2	Last year , 35 countries entered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;3	`` The number of entries directly reflects the changing face of the world map , '' Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President Arthur Hiller said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;4	`` Both halves of the former Czechoslovakia have submitted pictures , and we have four entries this year from what was once the single nation of Yugoslavia , '' Hiller said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;5	Nations entering films for the first time include Bosnia and Herzegovina , Belarus , the Czech Republic , Cambodia and Guatemala .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;6	Nominations will be announced at the academy on Feb. 14 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0579;7	The 67th annual presentation of the awards will take place at the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium March 27 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0580;0	Gold in Hong Kong dropped the equivalent of 2.09 U.S. dollars an ounce on Friday , opening at U.S. dlrs 379.66 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0580;1	It closed at U.S. dlrs 381.75 on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;0	The United States should resist any temptation to deal with organized crime in Russia or China , says a security expert recalling World War II contacts with the Italian Mafia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;1	`` The time may come when American national interests may clash most seriously with Russian or Chinese interests , '' and `` individuals in our government might then be tempted to form alliances with Russian or Chinese organized crime , as their predecessors did on Sicily in the 1940s , '' said Brian R. Sullivan , a fellow at the National Defense University 's Institute for Strategic Studies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;2	`` That probably would be a very bad idea , '' said Sullivan , mentioning the spread of crime in post-Soviet Russia and Triads `` reportedly gaining unprecedented strength '' in Chinese mainland cities and among overseas Chinese .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;3	Sullivan spoke at a forum on organized crime sponsored by the American Bar Association and other legal groups .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;4	It began Thursday and was continuing Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;5	`` Weighing the gains and losses ... it seems that American interests were far more damaged by the Mafia over the years than they were served , '' said Sullivan , who has closely studied Italy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;6	`` And the damage continues , particularly given heavy Mafia involvement in drug trafficking . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;7	Preparing for the allied invasion of Italy in 1943 in the campaign to overthrow the Rome-Berlin Axis , U.S. Naval Intelligence opened contact with Sicilian organized crime `` including with Italian-American criminals who had been deported from the United States ... -LRB- and -RRB- men who could be considered both well-informed and anti-Fascist , '' Sullivan said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;8	`` After the invasion , American authorities employed the same men and their associates , '' he continued , affording them access to arms `` to begin highly lucrative black market operations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;9	The modern Mafia began to form . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;10	In postwar Italy , the Vatican and U.S. administrations supported Italy 's Christian Democrats against the Communists `` in every way possible , '' Sullivan said , turning a blind eye to Christian-Democrat connections with organized crime that finally brought down seven-time Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;11	`` There is reason to believe that the Italian Mafia benefited greatly from American government support in 1943-45 and again in 1947-48 , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;12	Even today , `` the outcome of the war against the Mafia '' remains uncertain , Sullivan said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;13	But a lesson to be drawn from the vigorous anti-Mafia efforts of the late prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino is that feared crime syndicates become powerful because of government support and turn vulnerable when they lose it , he added .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;14	With the Mafia on the defensive , Falcone and Borsellino were both assassinated in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;15	A senior Federal Bureau of Investigation official , Jim E. Moody , told the gathering Italy has new laws to deal with organized crime that are as effective as laws in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0581;16	Public outrage over the Falcone and Borsellino killings demanded their enactment , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;0	An unmanned Ariane rocket carrying an American communications satellite crashed into the Atlantic Ocean 15 minutes after blastoff Thursday due to failure in the third-stage engine , which was using a new fuel mix .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;1	Technicians at the Arianespace launching pad on the edge of the South American jungle said that the third-stage engine inexplicably lost pressure 218 kilometers -LRB- 135 miles -RRB- above Earth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;2	The failure indicated continuing problems in the third stage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;3	In January , a third-stage breakdown forced engineers to explode a rocket in mid-flight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;4	A Turkish and a European telecommunications satellites were also destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;5	Six perfect launches followed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;6	Thursday 's crash was the seventh in 70 launches since the European Space Agency 's commercial Arianespace program lifted off 15 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;7	It should not shake Ariane 's dominance as the world 's most successful launcher of lucrative private satellites .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;8	`` We hope to get back into operation very quickly , '' said Charles Bigot , Arianespace 's chief executive officer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;9	An investigation was opened immediately and a news conference scheduled for Friday to explain the initial findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;10	Liftoff was on schedule at 7:38 p.m.
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;11	The first two stages fired perfectly and controllers confidently expected another of what have become almost routine shots for the Ariane launchers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;12	The third stage also lit properly , but then mysteriously sputtered and went out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;13	Officials said that the third stage was a new type using a new oxygen-hydrogen mixture to maximize performance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;14	The rocket took down with it a 2,985-kilogram -LRB- 3.3-ton -RRB- PanAmSat-3 telecommunications satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications in El Segundo , California .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;15	Belonging to PanAmSat of Greenwich , Conn. , the satellite would have channeled telephone , fax and television communications for most of North and South America , Europe and Africa over 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;16	It would have traveled in geostationary orbit over the mid-Atlantic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;17	January 's accident was blamed on a turbo-pump failure freezing the third-stage rocket motor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;18	That failure followed 26 straight successful launches in which the European rocket distanced itself from its competitors , the United States and China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0582;19	The Arianes have put 94 satellites in orbit and have a backlog of 38 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;0	Anti-government demonstrators pelted riot police with rocks and burned a police jeep Thursday to protest the inauguration of President Ernesto Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;1	At least 58 people were injured in the violence , which marred a festive national holiday , according to a Red Cross spokesman who refused to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;2	He said 30 of the injured were taken to a Red Cross hospital and 28 were treated at the scene .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;3	Five of the injured were reported in serious condition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;4	The violence erupted after a rally by 10,000 anti-government demonstrators scattered from the downtown Monument of the Revolution .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;5	Hundreds of rowdy youths ran up against a column of riot police at a major intersection near the Zocalo , the city 's main plaza .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;6	For more than an hour , shirtless youths heaved a steady stream of stones against plastic shields of riot police , who stood shoulder to shoulder blocking the route to a post-inaugural military parade attended briefly by Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;7	A government official telephoned The Associated Press and said the violence was an isolated incident caused by `` a small group of provocateurs . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;8	He did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;9	At one point , a handful of demonstrators wielding stout wooden clubs charged against the plastic shields of a phalanx of riot police , who counterattacked , forcing hundreds to flee .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;10	Protesters also torched a truck that bore the symbol of Zedillo 's Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;11	Police clubbed one young man and tore his shirt off after his burst through the phalanx of helmeted and baton-wielding officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;12	Another man in a straw sombrero stumbled , bleeding from the head .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;13	There was no immediate report on police injuries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0583;14	The protesters , ranging from city residnents to farmers in straw hats , raised banners of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party , a vocal opponent of the PRI 's monopoly on power .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;0	JoAnne Carner and Jim Albus were one of three teams tied for the lead Thursday after the first-round of the JCPenney Classic , a mixed-team event that pairs male and female pros .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;1	Playing a best-ball format , Carner , 55 , and Albus , 54 , had a 7-under-par 64 on the Innisbrook Resort 's Copperhead Course .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;2	They were tied with the teams of Jane Geddes and Brian Claar and Marta Figueras-Dotti and Brad Bryant .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;3	Eight other teams were at 6-under .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;4	`` Oh , yeah ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;5	`` Two over-50 players against players in their late 20s and early 30s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;6	I think that 's pretty good . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;7	Carner was aided by an early-week lesson from Albus , the former club pro who never played the Professional Golf Assocation Tour .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;8	`` I used to give 15 lessons a day , '' Albus said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;9	`` But that was the first one in about three years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;10	And I never gave one to a player like JoAnne . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;11	But she says it 's done wonders for her game .

APW_ENG_19941201.0584;13	The Carner-Albus team had a seven-birdie , no-bogey round .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;14	Carner made birdie putts from 12 , 25 and 6 feet , while Albus drained birdie putts from 15 , 12 , 12 and 3 feet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;15	Forty-six of the 52 teams were under par and 27 teams were within three strokes of the lead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;16	The format Friday changes to alternate-stroke before returning to best-ball Saturday and finishing with alternate-stroke on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0584;17	One stroke behind the co and leaders at 6 and under 65 were : Judy Dickinson and Jay Sigel , Dana Dormann and Fred Funk , Amy Alcott and Robin Freeman , Chris Johnson and Neal Lancaster , Gail Graham and Dave Barr , Beth Daniel and Davis Love III , Vicki Goetze and Steve Striker and Nancy Ramsbottom and Mike Sullivan .

APW_ENG_19941201.0585;0	The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved and sent to President Clinton the historic 124-nation GATT trade agreement that will slash tariffs worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;1	Clinton called Thursday night 's vote a `` victory for America '' and said he hopes it is a harbinger of cooperation between his Democratic administration and the opposition Republicans who soon will assume control of Congress .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;2	The Senate gave final congressional approval to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on a vote of 76-24 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;3	The House of Representatives had approved the accord on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;4	The Senate had voted 68-32 just minutes earlier to waive its own budget rules and remove a key procedural hurdle to passage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;5	Sixty votes were needed in the earlier vote .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;6	Clinton had worked throughout the day to convince wavering lawmakers to support the deal , and he exulted in its passage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;7	`` Let 's make the GATT vote the first vote of a new era of cooperation , '' said Clinton , who was joined by Democrats and Republicans alike in a victory celebration on the south lawn of the White House .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;8	`` America 's best days are ahead of us . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;9	Retiring Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said the vote sends a signal to the world that America and its workers remain the world 's leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;10	`` We do not fear competition ; we welcome it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;11	We do not shrink from the future ; we welcome that , '' Mitchell said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;12	On the crucial budget waiver vote , the accord was supported by 31 Republicans and 37 Democrats and was opposed by 15 Republicans and 17 Democrats .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;13	Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole said his office was still getting up to 2,000 calls a day protesting the agreement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;14	Dole said he had decided to support agreement , even with its flaws , because the alternative of defeat would be far worse .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;15	`` The bottom line is we just ca n't isolate ourselves from the rest of the world , '' Dole said before the Senate began voting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;16	The trade agreement cuts tariffs by an average of 38 percent worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;17	For the first time , it extends GATT rules to such new areas as reduction of trade-distorting agriculture subsidies , lowering trade barriers in service industries such as banking , and clamping down on copyright piracy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;18	It also creates a more powerful World Trade Organization to referee trade disputes and eliminates the one-country veto that a losing nation could use to block an adverse ruling .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;19	Supporters said the agreement , by cutting the border taxes Americans have to pay while at the same time lowering barriers U.S. businesses and farmers face overseas , would provide a tremendous boost to the U.S. economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;20	The Clinton administration estimated this would create a half-million new jobs and mean an annual increase of dlrs 150 billion in U.S. economic growth a decade from now , when the deal is fully implemented .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;21	That extra growth would put dlrs 1,700 more a year in the pockets of the average American family , the administration said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;22	However , opponents charged that the WTO represented a dangerous encroachment on U.S. sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;23	They said that seven previous GATT negotiating rounds to lower trade barriers have not cured America 's chronic trade deficit nor stopped the hemorrhage of manufacturing jobs overseas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;24	They warned that in textiles alone , one of America 's most protected industries , 1 million jobs could be lost .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;25	`` We are not leading in world trade .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;26	We are losing , '' Sen. Ernest Hollings , a Democrat from South Carolina , a leading textile state , said during floor debate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;27	`` The reality is that we are in decline .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;28	Everybody knows that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;29	The administration was anxious for a healthy bipartisan victory margin as a way to show that a Democratic White House will be able to work next year with the first Republican-controlled Congress in four decades .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;30	The Senate vote followed a surprisingly large 142-vote margin of victory in the House on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;31	Before the congressional action , only 36 other nations had approved GATT .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;32	But many other nations were simply waiting to see what the United States did .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;33	The agreement is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;34	The debate over the WTO came during the first outgoing session of Congress in 12 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;35	It was forced by Hollings , who used his power as a chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to block a vote before the November elections .
APW_ENG_19941201.0585;36	A diverse group of opponents worked down to the wire to defeat the deal , taking out newspaper ads and mobilizing opponents to telephone lawmakers .

APW_ENG_19941201.0587;0	For more than 40 years their wives and offspring waited , asked questions and waited some more .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;1	Finally they have pieced together much of the story of how their men on a secret mission were shot down over Korea -- by the Soviets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;2	Here is the first published account of what the Air Force called simply a `` mission over enemy territory . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;3	FORT WORTH , Texas -LRB- AP -RRB- -- On Dec. 5 , 1950 , the day after Capt. Charles E. McDonough was shot down in his Korean War spy plane , an Air Force telegram arrived in Glen Rose , Texas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;4	With official regret and a note of haunting finality it informed his wife , Mary Jo , that the plane had disappeared .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;5	`` All possible search completed , '' it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;6	He was gone , silently swallowed up in a war that would keep many grim secrets .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;7	The search , though , was anything but completed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;8	In a sense , it had not yet begun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;9	Nearly 44 years after the Air Force gave up on McDonough and the three other Americans aboard his silvery RB-45 reconnaissance bomber , new information has come to light -- evidence which points to Soviet involvement not only in the shootdown but also in exploiting McDonough after his capture .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;10	The evidence , not yet publicly disclosed by the U.S. government , contradicts recent denials by Moscow that the former Soviet Union had played any role .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;11	The loss of the RB-45 and its crew on Dec. 4 , 1950 , is n't even mentioned in the Air Force 's official history of the Korean War , although it notes that two planes of that type flew in the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;12	-LRB- The unmentioned McDonough plane , tail number 8-015 , made three . -RRB-
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;13	McDonough , of New London , Conn. , was commander of the three-plane detachment which flew missions mainly over North Korea from Yokota Air Base , Japan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;14	At 31 , this was his second war ; he flew bombers in Europe in World War II .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;15	The RB-45 , well before the U-2 and now an artifact of the Cold War , was no ordinary plane .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;16	It was converted from a jet bomber as the most advanced photo reconnaissance plane in the world , and this was its first wartime use .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;17	The Air Force knew the RB-45 was a target of Soviet intelligence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;18	Moscow was aware that U.S. Air Force planes were overflying its territory throughout the 1950s , but it did n't become an international issue until the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers in a CIA-operated U-2 spy plane on May 1 , 1960 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;19	This story of the RB-45 is based on interviews with relatives of two of the four crewmen , officers who knew them , and retired Korean War RB-45 pilots , as well as declassified war records and other government documents .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;20	It is the first published account of what the Air Force called simply a `` mission over enemy territory . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;21	Leading the effort to unravel the case are Jeanne Dear , the only child of Charles and Mary Jo McDonough , and Nancy Dean , the daughter of Col. John R. Lovell , a top Air Force intelligence officer who was based at the Pentagon but happened to be aboard the plane for reasons that may never be fully known .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;22	Mrs. Dear , 44 , of Fort Worth , was 6 months old at the time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;23	Because she never knew her father , she says , the pain of sifting through his past does n't sting as badly .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;24	But her voice makes clear that the emotional armor she wears is not impenetrable .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;25	`` It 's hard , '' she says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;26	`` It 's a commitment I feel to my mother . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;27	For her and Mrs. Dean the search has been complicated by the secret nature of the RB-45 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;28	Although never officially acknowledged by Washington , men who flew this plane in Korea say their top-secret missions sometimes took them deep into Chinese and Soviet airspace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;29	More routinely , it flew photo reconnaissance over North Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;30	Records that could shed light on McDonough 's mission that fateful day have not been found .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;31	Louis Carrington of Tyler , Texas , one of the two other pilots in McDonough 's unit , recalls that `` Mac '' and his crew , attired in blue flight suits , took off into clear skies from Yokota Air Base at about lunchtime on Dec. 4 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;32	He remembers McDonough , 6-foot-3 -LRB- 1.9-meter -RRB- and blue-eyed , as a likable , accomplished , robust man .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;33	`` He could do anything , '' Carrington says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;34	The last word from the RB-45 crew was a routine radio contact 100 minutes after takeoff , signalling their entry into North Korean airspace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;35	Then , everlasting silence .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;36	The crash site was never pinpointed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;37	No bodies were recovered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;38	The McDonough and Lovell daughters have n't lived on hope that their fathers are alive .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;39	`` I ca n't get sucked into the emotional quagmire , '' said Mrs. Dean , 62 , who was a freshman at the College of William and Mary when her father was listed as missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;40	`` My father would not have wanted that . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;41	Yet she 's convinced there is more to the story than the Air Force admits .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;42	John `` Jack '' Lovell , then 46 , worked directly for the head of Air Force intelligence , Maj. Gen. Charles P. Cabell .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;43	Lovell 's presence on the plane is a mystery .
APW_ENG_19941201.0587;44	He was not a regular crew member , but Mrs. Dean believes he had a hand in overseeing the RB-45 's spy role .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;0	Mrs. Dean recalls helping her father pack his bags on Nov. 23 , the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;1	He left that night , saying only that he was headed to the Far East .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;2	For years there were only two hints of his fate : -- His name was mentioned in an `` enemy broadcast '' picked up by U.S. intelligence in China on May 21 , 1951 , which suggested he had been captured in Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;3	-- His was among 71 names of Americans listed by the U.S. Far East Command as `` men positively identified as remaining in the hands of the Communists '' after the final exchange of Allied and Communist POWs in September 1953 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;4	Yet he never was officially listed as a POW .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;5	Mrs. Dean recently obtained the list from a declassified Dec. 14 , 1954 , report in the files of the U.S. Far East Command .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;6	Nearly a year earlier , on Feb. 28 , 1954 , the government had declared Lovell dead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;7	He was a graduate of West Point -LRB- class of ' 27 -RRB- , a former U.S. Olympic boxing team coach , and veteran of Cold War espionage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;8	The two other men on board were co-pilot Capt. Jules E. Young , 29 , of East Rochester , N.Y. , and 1st Lt. James J. Picucci , 32 , of New York City , the navigator .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;9	When the daughters of Lovell and McDonough started researching the incident in detail in 1992 , both were surprised to learn that many records from that period are lost ; many are still classified secret , off-limits to most citizens .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;10	Mrs. Dear began her quest in earnest in 1992 when she called the Air Force casualty office at Randolph Air Force Base , Texas , to ask for the file on her father .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;11	The news was a bombshell : Her father 's name was on a list of U.S. airmen provided by the Russian government .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;12	`` I was absolutely stunned , '' Mrs. Dear recalls .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;13	But no one could tell her what the list was , whether she should think her father had been taken by the Russians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;14	The Russian list indicates that McDonough and other U.S. POWs were interrogated by Soviet officers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;15	Indeed , the Russians later released a copy of a McDonough interrogation which says a Soviet `` prepared the questions '' and `` a Chinese comrade translated '' the answers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;16	Still , Moscow denies it ever had contact with the RB-45 crew .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;17	Mrs. Dear began digging .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;18	She attended congressional hearings in Washington , searched Air Force archives and read books on the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;19	She also found Nancy Dean , who had begun her own research , helped by her husband , Dick , at their Wheaton , Md. , home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;20	Many questions about the RB-45 case went unanswered in the years after the last American POWs returned from Korea , but the one that mattered most to each crew member 's family was : Did he , in fact , die ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;21	Mary Jo McDonough stayed in Glen Rose after her husband was listed as missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;22	She did n't wait idly , but she got no answers to her requests for information about her husband 's fate .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;23	Then , thanks to her daughter 's persistence , an answer came in October 1993 : McDonough died about two weeks after his plane was shot down .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;24	Not all details are known , and the body has not been recovered .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;25	`` My mother had been waiting for 40 years , '' Mrs. Dear says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;26	`` For us it 's like a miracle '' to know for sure he died , and to complete their grieving .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;27	Ironically , the clinching evidence came not from U.S. government files but from Russia , whose MiG fighters shot down McDonough 's plane near the Yalu River that separates North Korea from China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;28	McDonough parachuted from the plane .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;29	The one-page document which said McDonough had died was found in Russian archives by Paul Cole of the research firm Defense Forecasts Inc. , who has extensively studied Soviet links to Korean War MIA cases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;30	Mrs. Dear got a copy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;31	It was dated Dec. 18 , 1950 -- exactly two weeks after the shootdown -- but did not indicate the exact date or cause of death .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;32	Routing notations on the document indicate it circulated at the highest levels of the Soviet military staff in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;33	`` I am informing you that the pilot from the shot-down B-45 aircraft died en route and the interrogation was not finished , '' said the note in Russian .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;34	It was signed by Marshal Stepan Krasovsky , the senior Soviet military adviser to China , and addressed to Marshal Pavel Batitsky , chief of the General Staff in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;35	This fits with recollections of the only American known to have talked to McDonough after he was shot down .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;36	Retired Air Force pilot Hamilton B. Shawe Jr. , of Reno , Nev. , said he spent about three days with McDonough as a POW in a bombed-out prison in Sinuiju , in northern Korea , starting about Dec. 14 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;37	He says he last saw McDonough being taken away from the prison on an ox cart , and that he was in such bad condition that it seemed unlikely he could live much longer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;38	Shawe said McDonough told him he had parachuted from the burning wreckage of the RB-45 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;39	He later suffered severe frostbite while trying to evade capture in the frozen wilds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;40	When he sought food at an isolated Korean house , the occupants turned him in to the military .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;41	The exact time sequence is still unclear .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;42	Shawe reported his contact with McDonough to the Air Force in 1953 when he was released from captivity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;43	On the basis of his information , and the lack of other news , the Air Force issued a presumptive finding of death on March 1 , 1954 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;44	Although the McDonough family members accept the Russian document as evidence that he died , they realize it raises other questions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;45	Where were they taking him when he died ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;46	What did the Soviets want from him ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0588;47	What was done with the body ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;0	A second Russian document obtained by Cole this year makes the Soviet link even clearer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;1	It says the RB-45 was shot down about 45 miles -LRB- 72.5 kilometers -RRB- east of Andung , China , just across the border from Sinuiju , North Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;2	The report summarizes what McDonough said under a Soviet-controlled interrogation and asks that Russian `` advisers '' in Korea help retrieve downed American aircraft and `` details . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;3	This document was dated Dec. 17 , 1950 , and was signed by the Soviet commander of the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps , which headed Soviet air operations in Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;4	The note was addressed to top military officers in the Kremlin .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;5	In November 1994 , Mrs. Dear learned more painful details through a confidential source who interviewed the MiG pilot , A.F. Andrianov , who is credited with shooting down the RB-45 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;6	Andrianov recalled being told by the Soviet officer who interrogated McDonough that while McDonough was being moved from Sinuiju , apparently on Dec. 18 , a sign was hung on him , `` U.S. War Criminal . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;7	A crowd of North Koreans gathered around the defiant American and beat him to death , Mrs. Dear said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;8	For that final injustice , she and her mother hold both the North Koreans and the former Soviet Union responsible , though she strongly doubts the American government will ever seek any sort of apology .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;9	Because Andrianov said he saw only one parachute emerge from the RB-45 , Mrs. Dean now accepts that her father , Lovell the intelligence officer , died in the crash .
APW_ENG_19941201.0589;10	Her search , too , is ended , though she still wonders why her father was there .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;0	Prime Minister Rafik Hariri offered to resign after a stormy Cabinet meeting in which he accused his opponents of trying to sabotage government proposals , aides said early Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;1	Speaking on condition of anonymity , Hariri 's aides said the Syrian - and Saudi Arabian-backed billionaire offered his resignation in a telephone call late Thursday night to President Elias Hrawi .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;2	Hrawi , a Sunni Muslim , had not yet accepted or rejected the resignation because it must first be made in writing , presumably later Friday , the aides said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;3	The resignation offer was triggered by a heated exchange between Hariri and a Shiite Muslim Cabinet member , Housing Minister Mahmoud Abu Hamdan , the aides said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;4	The aides said Hariri accused Hamdan and other opponents of trying to block all government-proposed legislation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;5	Hamdan is one of a group of ministers in the 30-member Cabinet that is aligned with Nabih Berri , the Shiite speaker of Parliament and head of the Amal movement , a powerful militia in Lebanon 's 1975-1990 civil war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;6	Critics have accused Hariri , a self-made tycoon with substantial real-estate and civil-engineering holdings , of trying to grab a large share of the multibillion-dollar postwar reconstruction projects for his own companies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;7	They also claim he is trying to ram his decisions through the Cabinet , ignoring the opposition .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;8	Hariri , 51 , was appointed prime minister Oct. 22 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;9	At the time , he was hailed as Lebanon 's savior who would rescue the onetime `` Switzerland of the Middle East '' from economic oblivion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;10	The Lebanese hoped his wholesome image , his wealth and his powerful Syrian and Saudi connections would help him achieve what previous government had not : an economic turnaround to erase the war 's devastation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;11	His record has been mixed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;12	Much of war-ravaged central Beirut is being bulldozed as part of a massive reconstruction to make the Lebanese capital once more a financial and trade magnet for the region .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;13	But the reconstruction has been slower than expected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;14	Earlier this year , Hariri refused to attend government meetings for several days to protest the slowness of government action on reconstruction .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;15	Hariri built much of his dlrs 3 billion fortune in Saudi Arabia and enjoys a close friendship with the Saudi royal family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0590;16	According to a national covenant dating to independence from France in 1943 , Lebanon 's president is a Maronite Catholic , the Parliament speaker is a Shiite and the prime minister is a Sunni .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;0	Of all the closets society has built to hide the people it would shun , none are as dreaded as the colonies that hide victims of leprosy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;1	The disease , as old as antiquity , has been conquered by medicine , but the stigma remains .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;2	Now a group of former victims wants society to heal its attitude as well .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;3	PETROPOLIS , Brazil -LRB- AP -RRB- -- It was the spring of 1947 when Haobin Kong learned he was a pariah .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;4	At dawn his mother woke the 16-year-old boy and walked him -- always keeping several paces ahead -- through the fields of Guandong province in southern China to a remote leprosy colony run by missionaries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;5	`` She left me at the gate , turned and walked away without a goodbye , '' says Kong , a gaunt man of 63 , his hands twisted , his mouth deformed by leprosy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;6	`` I never saw her or my family again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;7	I realized then what it was to be a victim of leprosy , to be an outcast , a nobody . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;8	Now Kong and dozens of former patients from around the world have joined to fight the stigma associated with leprosy , a stigma that has turned them into symbols of dread and reproach even among friends and family .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;9	They gathered recently at a Roman Catholic convent in this mountain city 40 miles -LRB- 65 kilometers -RRB- north of Rio de Janeiro and formed the first worldwide defense league for victims of Hansen 's disease -- leprosy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;10	The weeklong conference brought together 70 former victims from China , India , Cuba , Japan , South Korea and Brazil , along with health advocates from the United States and Europe .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;11	`` This movement is historic , '' said Anwei Law , a public health expert from Oak Hill , W. Va. , and the organization 's new treasurer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;12	`` It 's the first time people affected by leprosy have come together to fight the stigma of this disease , to tell the world they have a right to a normal life . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;13	Francisco Vieira Nunes , the new head of the defense league , said the first task was to rebuild the self-esteem of former patients who never had the courage to leave their colonies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;14	`` Once a leper , always a leper , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;15	`` You lose your name , you get eased out of your job , you lose your self-worth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;16	Well , now we want our identities back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;17	We want to join the world again . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;18	The stigma goes back to biblical times , when victims of leprosy were banished from communities under penalty of death , forced to wear cowbells around their necks and hoods and robes to hide their lesions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;19	They remained outcasts through the centuries , even as science slowly peeled away the mysteries of their disease and discovered a combination of drugs that reversed the effects of leprosy bacteria .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;20	Today , with researchers expecting to announce a revolutionary anti-leprosy vaccine by 2000 , the disease still inspires fear and prejudice .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;21	The 1988 edition of Webster 's New World Dictionary , for example , defines a victim of leprosy as `` a person to be shunned or ostracized , because of the danger of moral contamination . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;22	`` Leprosy must be shifted from being just a medical problem to a social problem , '' says Dr. Joon Lew , chairman of the Lew Institute for Biomedical Research in Seoul , South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;23	`` Even if a vaccine is developed to prevent leprosy , you simply ca n't continue to ignore or treat with contempt millions of people who once had or are still treating the disease . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;24	The idea of a defense league began in August 1993 , during the 14th World Leprosy Congress in Orlando , Fla. , where 2,000 doctors and scientists gathered to discuss progress on vaccine research .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;25	Law , a medical and cultural historian , said a token number of 20 former leprosy patients were allowed to attend , but they were not permitted to meet any of the scientists , let alone address the conference .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;26	`` That was the last straw , '' Nunes says .
APW_ENG_19941201.0591;27	`` The doctors had no time for the people they were supposed to be helping , only for their cold medical data and theories . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;0	With donations from private and church groups , the league brought patients from leprosy colonies around the world to Brazil , where as many as a half-million people have leprosy -- second highest in the world behind India .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;1	After a life of fear and isolation , people who had never been allowed to ride a bus , obtain a passport , or shake hands with non-victims were suddenly face to face with foreigners who wanted to hear their story .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;2	Kong began by telling a tale of a life half-lived , an existence stunted by ignorance , prejudice and fear .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;3	After the Communist revolution of 1949 , Kong , like most of the half-million Chinese then afflicted with leprosy , was kept quarantined in a far-off colony because the government lacked the drugs available to treat the disease .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;4	For 13 years , he and 200 other patients never went farther than the hospital compound , never knowing when or if they would ever leave .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;5	Kong learned to read and write , and eventually married another patient .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;6	After dawn on Nov. 16 , 1960 , a medic shook him awake as he slept in his cot .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;7	`` You 're cured , '' said the medic , and walked out of the room .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;8	But by then , Kong 's family had moved away without a trace .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;9	He could n't find a job or a housing development that would take him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;10	Months later , he and his wife returned to the colony to stay .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;11	Another participant , Guanzhou Chen , 45 , of China 's Guandong province , said he was interned at age 7 at a state colony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;12	But although he was cured four years later , his family did not want him back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;13	`` Fear was in their eyes , in their hearts , '' he said through an interpreter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;14	`` So I returned to the colony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;15	I never wanted to leave it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;16	I can not stand the rejection again . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;17	Chen said he tried to find a job in the `` outside world , '' but in 30 years has not been formally employed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;18	These days he fixes washing machines and television sets on the side to make extra spending money .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;19	But even for those who escaped the colonies , the wounds of social prejudice have not healed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;20	A South Korean executive told the gathering how he , too , was rejected by friends and family after contracting leprosy at a young age .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;21	He was cured of the disease quickly , but the stigma still haunts him .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;22	`` Please , do not give my name , or any details .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;23	It could wreck my business , '' he pleaded with a visiting reporter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;24	`` No one knows where I am , and they should n't know , please . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;25	A special challenge for the league is how to raise money without pandering to stereotypes and at a time when donations for nonprofit organizations worldwide are drying up .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;26	`` We have to get away from the old fund-raising campaigns that showed horrible pictures of lepers solely to evoke pity , '' Law said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;27	`` Those images helped get money , but they also reinforced the stereotype of a miserable leper .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;28	We need to get away from that , to portray lepers as people with dignity , who are willing and able to work to survive . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;29	Pamela Parlapiano , a New York City resident who has photographed victims of Hansen 's disease from Africa to the Amazon , showed a picture of an Indian man with one hand carrying a clay pot of building materials to build a modest home .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;30	`` The idea is to show their ability , not dwell on their disability , '' Parlapiano said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;31	As the conference ended , the former patients hugged and kissed each other , and several wept .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;32	Kong extended his gnarled hand to a reporter .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;33	He squeezed tightly , his eyes shining and watery , reluctant to let go .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;34	`` This is the first week Mr. Kong has ever touched or shaken the hand of a person who never had leprosy , '' explained Dr. Wang Yang Shen , a specialist at the Hongwei Hospital in Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;35	`` For him , it is a special day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0592;36	It is the first time he has felt completely human in so long a time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;0	U.S. Major League Baseball negotiators returned to their offices Thursday , with the owners saying the next move in the three-month-old strike is up to the players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;1	`` The ball is in their court , '' said acting commissioner Bud Selig , borrowing a metaphor from another sport .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;2	Players said they hope to have a counterproposal ready next Friday , when talks resume in Rye Brook , N.Y.
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;3	The owners vow to start the season with or without union players .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;4	Federally-appointed mediator W.J. Usery is considering attending the union 's three-day executive board meeting that starts Monday in Atlanta .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;5	Eugene Orza , the union 's No. 2 official , said his group already has been discussing a counteroffer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;6	A large number of players are expected in Atlanta and management hopes players will pressure union head Donald Fehr to make a deal .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;7	On Wednesday , owners put their threat to implement a salary cap on hold .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;8	The major league meeting that had been scheduled for Chicago next Monday was postponed to Dec. 15 or 16 to allow the union additional time to formulate a plan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;9	A new proposal from the union wo n't necessarily lead to progress , given the deep gulf between the sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;10	Owners want to place a ceiling on the amount of money teams can spend on player salaries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0593;11	The players ' union wants to retain the current sustem , which permits players to negotiate individual conhtracts , often for very high salaries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;0	An unmanned Ariane rocket carrying an American communications satellite crashed into the Atlantic Ocean 15 minutes after blastoff Thursday due to failure in the third-stage engine , which was using a new fuel mix .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;1	Technicians at the Arianespace launching pad on the edge of the South American jungle said that the third-stage engine inexplicably lost pressure 218 kilometers -LRB- 135 miles -RRB- above Earth .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;2	The failure indicated continuing problems in the third stage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;3	In January , a third-stage breakdown forced engineers to explode a rocket in mid-flight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;4	A Turkish and a European telecommunications satellites were also destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;5	Six perfect launches followed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;6	Thursday 's crash was the seventh in 70 launches since the European Space Agency 's commercial Arianespace program lifted off 15 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;7	It should not shake Ariane 's dominance as the world 's most successful launcher of lucrative private satellites .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;8	`` We hope to get back into operation very quickly , '' said Charles Bigot , Arianespace 's chief executive officer , who apologized to the dlrs 150 million satellite 's owners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;9	An investigation was opened immediately and a news conference scheduled for Friday to explain the initial findings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;10	Liftoff was on schedule at 7:38 p.m.
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;11	The first two stages fired perfectly and controllers confidently expected another of what have become almost routine shots for the Ariane launchers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;12	The third stage also lit properly , but then mysteriously sputtered and went out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;13	Officials said that the third stage was a new type using a new oxygen-hydrogen mixture to maximize performance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;14	The rocket took down with it a 2,985-kilogram -LRB- 3.3-ton -RRB- PanAmSat-3 telecommunications satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications in El Segundo , California .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;15	Belonging to PanAmSat of Greenwich , Conn. , the satellite would have channeled telephone , fax and television communications for most of North and South America , Europe and Africa over 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;16	It would have traveled in geostationary orbit over the mid-Atlantic .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;17	January 's accident was blamed on a turbo-pump failure freezing the third-stage rocket motor .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;18	That failure followed 26 straight successful launches in which the European rocket distanced itself from its competitors , the United States and China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0594;19	The Arianes have put 94 satellites in orbit and have a backlog of 38 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;0	George Foreman got him mad and Eddie Futch set him straight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;1	Now , Riddick Bowe says , he 's ready to answer critics who have questioned both his weight and his desire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;2	`` It 's just like during the Olympics when they said he 's lazy and he 's crazy , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;3	`` People think I 'm no longer hungry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;4	That 's not true . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;5	Bowe returns to the ring Saturday for only the second time since losing his heavyweight titles to Evander Holyfield when he meets unbeaten former Olympian Larry Donald in a scheduled 12-round bout .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;6	It 's somewhat of a crossroads fight for the former champion , who is trying to shake the complacency that came with the titles and the accompanying fat bank account .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;7	`` The luxury mentality is gone , '' said Bowe 's manager , Rock Newman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;8	`` Somewhere he has gotten it back .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;9	He has to grab the bull by the horns -LRB- take the initiative -RRB- and this is what he has done . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;10	Bowe , who weighed 247 pounds -LRB- 112 kilos -RRB- for his aborted return to the ring in August against Buster Mathis Jr. , claims to be in his best shape since beating Holyfield in November 1992 to win the titles .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;11	On Thursday , Bowe weighed in at 241 pounds -LRB- 109 kilos -RRB- , a drop of six pounds -LRB- 3 kilos -RRB- from his last fight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;12	Donald was at 228 pounds -LRB- 103 kilos -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;13	If Bowe is in the shape he claims to be , it 's because of a talk from Futch , his 83-year-old trainer , coupled with the shock of seeing the 45-year-old Foreman knock Michael Moorer out to win two-thirds of the title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;14	`` The Foreman fight really ticked me off , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;15	`` It 's unfortunate Michael Moorer is dumber than all outdoors .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;16	Why would you stand in front of George Foreman like that ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;17	After watching Foreman beat Michael Moorer , I became more determined . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;18	Futch had earlier threatened to leave Bowe 's New Orleans training camp unless the former champion rededicated himself to his training efforts .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;19	Futch said Bowe was n't following a program prescribed by physical therapist Mackey Shilstone as closely as he should .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;20	`` I said , ` If you do n't care about yourself , why should I care about you ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;21	I am here for you , '' ' Futch said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;22	The message seems to have sunk in for Bowe , who many thought would hold the heavyweight titles a long time after handing Holyfield his first loss .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;23	Instead , Bowe defended the title with two quick knockouts over Jesse Ferguson and Michael Dokes , then lost them last November in a close 12-round decision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;24	`` I still think I won that fight , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;25	`` I wanted to knock Evander Holyfield out so bad because no one had ever done that .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;26	If I had just used my jab , he could n't touch me .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;27	I allowed him to get too close to me . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;28	The 27-year-old Bowe , 34-1 with 29 knockouts , came into the Holyfield rematch 11 pounds heavier than he was when he won the title .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;29	Although both he and Futch said the extra weight was simply a result of Bowe continuing to grow , it seemed to take a toll on him during the fight .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;30	`` As long as I 'm in shape , I beat all the heavyweights out there , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;31	`` They can only hope I 'm fat and come in out of condition . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;32	Bowe not only has to beat Donald , a 1992 Olympian who is 16-0 as a pro , he has to look good doing it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;33	After planned fights against Lennox Lewis and Moorer fell apart because of losses by the two fighters , Bowe finds himself effectively shut out of chances against either Foreman or WBC champion Oliver McCall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;34	Bowe , though , is the No. 1 contender in the lightly regarded WBO , and could face Herbie Hide for that title in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;35	Winning that title could give him the leverage needed to get the big fights .
APW_ENG_19941201.0595;36	`` I do n't care what title it is as long as it indicates I 'm the heavyweight champion of the world , '' Bowe said .

APW_ENG_19941201.0596;0	Ernesto Zedillo began his term as Mexico 's president by vowing to clean up the justice system , fight poverty , strengthen democracy and renew efforts to end a Indian revolt in southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;1	Zedillo , who rose from youth as a shoeshine boy to earn an economics doctorate from Yale , was sworn in Thursday before 1,500 Mexican and foreign officials at the Chamber of Deputies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;2	He received the green , white and red presidential slash from former President Salinas de Gortari to begin a six-year-term at the helm of this nation of 90 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;3	`` We think he will be a good president ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;4	said Carmen Valencia , a 60-year-old housewife .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;5	`` He came from below and understands poverty . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;6	About 80 protesters among a crowd of hundreds clashed with riot police , hurling rocks and burning two vehicles after the ceremony .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;7	Police responded with tear gas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;8	A Red Cross spokesman said 58 people were injured .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;9	The protesters had emerged from a peaceful gathering by about 10,000 at the Monument of the Revolution in downtown Mexico City .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;10	They shouted `` Out with Zedillo ! ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;11	and called for an end to the 65-year rule of his Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;12	Zedillo , 42 , said one of his first acts would be to introduce a constitutional amendment for a `` profound transformation '' of the justice system , now subservient to politicians and often accused of corruption .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;13	He also vowed to balance the overwhelming power of the presidency by strengthening congress and local governments and to end the presidential practice of dominating PRI affairs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;14	`` If he fulfills what he said about not interfering with the party , then it will be a a great parting of the waters for reforms in the PRI , '' said Augustine Basave , a former PRI congressman from Monterrey .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;15	On the economic front , Zedillo promised to follow in the free-market footsteps of Salinas , who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement , slashed inflation and privatized hundreds of state-owned companies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;16	`` I shall continue to apply those principles in order to preserve our national sovereignty and promote Mexico 's legitimate interests in a world of keen competition ... '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;17	The ceremony was attended by representatives of 63 nations , including Vice President Al Gore , Cuban President Fidel Castro and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;18	`` Mexico has certainly prospered , '' said Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;19	But he added , `` We can not feel fully satisfied .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;20	Many millions of Mexicans lack the bare essentials . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;21	The bookish Zedillo would not have been at the helm of one of the most powerful presidencies in the world had it not been for the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the hand-picked successor to Salinas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;22	Many Mexicans say they doubt the official theory of a lone gunman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;23	Another killing shook the nation in September , when PRI secretary-general Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu was gunned down .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;24	Prosecutors charged that senior members of the ruling party were involved , possibly as an effort to stop reforms .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;25	`` The brutal assassinations of two of Mexico 's most outstanding public figures have deeply hurt our citizens , '' Zedillo said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;26	`` Thus , the investigations have not been to the entire satisfaction of society .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;27	We ... want to be sure that we know the truth . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;28	One of Zedillo 's biggest challenges comes from the southern state of Chiapas , where Indian guerrillas have refused to end a rebellion that has been stalled since a Jan. 12 cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;29	`` I am convinced that it is possible to achieve a new negotiation in Chiapas that will lead us to a just , honorable and definitive peace , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0596;30	He promised the army would maintain the unilateral cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;0	In a bargaining session that raised hopes of saving the season , National Hockey League players Thursday gave ground on at least one issue and both sides agreed in principle on several others .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;1	The owners and union met for about eight hours in wide-ranging discussions aimed at ending the 62-day lockout .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;2	Among the issues on the table are the rookie salary cap , salary arbitration and free agency .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;3	Since the owners locked players out on Oct. 1 , the season has dwindled down to 60 games , with 24 games stripped from each team .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;4	It has been generally acknowledged there must be a labor agreement in place by mid-December to assure a season .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;5	Neither side would characterize Thursday 's talks , but the Canadian Press reported the union had dropped its desired salary ceiling to dlrs 1.25 million from dlrs 1.5 million for first-round players , while the NHL remained at dlrs 700,000 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;6	On salary arbitration , the NHL wants to retain its right to have an arbitrator 's decision to be non-binding on the team -- rather than paying the awarded salary , a team could allow the player to become an unrestricted free agent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;7	The league also proposed that only two players per team per year be eligible for salary arbitration .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;8	The NHL players union wants arbitration to be binding .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;9	The two sides did agree that , in an arbitration case , an unrestricted free agent 's contract can not be used to provide comparisons and arrive at a decision , a source told CP .
APW_ENG_19941201.0597;10	On free agency , both sides agreed that players shall become unrestricted free agents upon reaching the age of 28 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0598;0	Cuba loosened the shackles on its economy another notch Thursday when it allowed some surplus clothes and other goods to be sold at free-market prices .
APW_ENG_19941201.0598;1	But Cuban reporters contacted by phone said the selection and the customers were reportedly skimpy at newly established shops .
APW_ENG_19941201.0598;2	The measure appeared to have far less immediate impact than the recent legalization of a limited free market in foodstuffs -- one of a series of reforms that has helped the Communist government stabilize its once-plummeting economy .
APW_ENG_19941201.0598;3	The government has slashed government spending , welcomed foreign investors and tourists , and created a free market in farm products once government quotas have been met .
APW_ENG_19941201.0598;4	Those measures have contributed to a stronger Cuban peso , which which had been in free-fall against the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;0	The wife of embattled Los Angeles Kings president Bruce McNall filed for divorce Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;1	Jane Merriam Cody cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;2	She is seeking half of McNall 's assets and custody of the couple 's children , ages 11 and 9 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;3	The couple married on Jan. 8 , 1983 -- five years before McNall bought the Los Angeles Kings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;4	They separated in February , according to papers filed in Superior Court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;5	McNall , 44 , is expected to plead guilty Dec. 7 to federal fraud charges of defrauding a half-dozen loan institutions of more than dlrs 236 million .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;6	In May , McNall sold 72 percent interest in the Kings as his financial troubles mounted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;7	He remains president and a minority owner of the NHL team .
APW_ENG_19941201.0599;8	Cody 's attorney , Tara McGuinness , did not immediately respond to a telephone message Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;0	Russia has decided not to proceed with a threatened lawsuit that could have sought hundreds of thousands of dollars from Nova Scotia fishermen who blockaded a Russian ship last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;1	`` It certainly is a relief that they 're not pursuing it , '' said Cliff Fanning of the Eastern Fishermen 's Federation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;2	In July 1993 , fishermen from Fanning 's group and the South West Nova Scotia Fixed Gear Association blockaded the fish-carrying freighter Pioner Murmana as it unloaded at the Continental Seafoods plant in Shelburne , N.S. , in July 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;3	Hemmed in by fishing boats , the freezer ship could n't move for seven days .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;4	Ivan Vidaneev , Russia 's fishery agent in Nova Scotia , said the Russian government company that owns the Pioner Murmana consulted a Nova Scotia law firm but then decided against the suit .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;5	Vidaneev said he believes there was enough publicity during the blockade to ensure that the Canadians responsible for the losses to the Russian government could be identified .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;6	However , he cited four complications that made the case difficult to pursue :
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;7	Vidaneev warned , however , that the decision might be different if there are similar blockades in the future .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;8	The Murmansk-based Pioner Mirmana was unloading 12,000 tonnes of frozen fish from the Barents Sea for processing at the Continental Seafoods plant in Shelburne when fishing boats blocked it from leaving .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;9	Cod stocks in the Barents Sea , between Russia and Norway , have been recovering while stocks off Atlantic Canada have declined to the point where the fishery is banned in most areas .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;10	The blockading fishermen were angry that Russian and other foreign vessels are allowed to fish in Canadian waters for low-value species such as silver hake , mackerel and squid that Canadians do n't want .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;11	There was a widely held belief among the blockading fishermen that the Pioner Murmana obtained the cod from Russian trawlers in Canadian waters , not the Barents Sea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;12	Fisheries officials have said subsequently that genetic tests confirmed the fish was from the Barents Sea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;13	However , Fanning said he still does n't believe it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;14	`` It was n't Barents Sea cod ; it was our cod , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;15	The seven-day blockade was costly not only for the Pioner Murmana but also for the Russian factory trawler Dauriya , fishing in North American waters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;16	The Pioner Murmana 's next job after unloading at Shelburne was to take on the Dauriya catch at sea .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;17	The Dauriya had to stop fishing because it was full to capacity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;18	Anatoliy Mikhailov , the Russian fishery agent at the time of the blockade , had talked about suing the fishermen for about $ 250,000 US -LRB- $ 322,250 Cdn -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;19	Meanwhile , hopes of developing a Canadian fishery for silver hake and processing the under-utilized species at an idle fish plant in Lockeport , N.S. , have never materialized .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;20	The fishermen remain upset that foreigners are still being allowed to fish such species in Canadian waters .
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;21	`` Instead of encouraging foreign allocation and having no real hold over these people , why not encourage our own fleets to develop those fisheries ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0600;22	`` Ports are folding up and here 's a way of keeping them open . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;0	Leading man Richard Gere and supermodel Cindy Crawford , whose marriage three years ago made them perhaps the most beautiful couple in Hollywood , have separated .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;1	The pair announced their breakup in a statement issued Thursday by their public relations firm .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;2	`` This personal and painful decision was made between us in July , '' they said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;3	`` Since that time we have been trying to work things out , but due to the recent conjecture in the press , we have decided to make a statement at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;4	Last month , a British tabloid published a photo of a woman hopping over Gere 's garden wall .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;5	But model Laura Bailey said she was visiting a friend next door .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;6	Gere , 45 , and Crawford , 28 , married three years ago .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;7	There have been recurring rumors that each of them is gay and their marriage troubled .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;8	In May , the couple published a full-page ad in the Times of London , proclaiming their heterosexuality and their commitment to one another .
APW_ENG_19941201.0602;9	Gere 's acting credits include `` An Officer and a Gentleman '' and `` Pretty Woman . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0603;2	His mother said another son , aged five , was fine but her 3-year-old son was missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;3	It was not immediately clear how many of the 495 passengers and 45 crew were rescued , but by late morning at least 60 of those saved were safely in Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;4	Private radio station ZZMM said more than 200 people were rescued .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;5	`` We were sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;6	Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;7	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;8	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' said survivor Erwin Maravilla .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;9	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;10	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;11	He was one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;12	The Singapore-registered Kota Suria , with a crew of 26 , suffered damage to its bow but was joining the rescue effort .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;13	There was no immediate cause reported for the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;14	The ferry , the Cebu City , sank 30 minutes after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;15	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;16	`` We can not say if there are any casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;17	We do not want to assume there are casualties , '' said navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Anselmo Cabingan .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;18	At least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were trying to recover survivors , he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;19	The Cebu City had an 800-pasenger capacity , said a spokesman for the Williams Lines shipping company .
APW_ENG_19941201.0603;20	In December of 1987 the Philippines suffered the worst-ever peacetime ferry disaster , when 3,537 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .

APW_ENG_19941201.0606;1	Ex-Prosecutor Warwick Reid reportedly is on an underworld hit list after turning state 's evidence and testifying against organized crime connections in corruption trials in Hong Kong .
APW_ENG_19941201.0606;2	`` It 's not uncommon for revenge to be exacted in Hong Kong -- it 's not uncommon for people to exact revenge in other jurisdictions , '' corruption commission chief Alf Morris said on Radio New Zealand .

APW_ENG_19941201.0606;4	Reid 's sentence was reduced after he gave evidence against conspirators in the corruption scheme , making him a likely target for those he named and their associates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0606;5	Morris declined to speculate on what might happen to Reid , but added , `` we do perceive that there still is a risk to Mr. Reid 's safety . ''

APW_ENG_19941201.0607;0	The offer to hold World Cup ski races in the United States because of warm weather in Europe is expected to be rejected .
APW_ENG_19941201.0607;1	Men 's races set for Val d'Isere , France , and Val Gardena , Italy , have been canceled because of poor snow conditions and unseasonably high temperatures .
APW_ENG_19941201.0607;2	Races in Alta Badia and Madonna di Campiglio , Italy , set for Dec. 11 and 13 are pending for the same reason .

APW_ENG_19941201.0607;5	As of Thursday , the International Ski Federation was indicating it will continue to try to find alternate sites in Europe for the races .

APW_ENG_19941201.0608;2	But Kari Takko , a former National Hockey League goaltender for the Minnesota North Stars , held firm , turning away 17 shots in the period .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;3	It was the 12th consecutive loss for last-place Tappara -LRB- 3-18-2 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;4	Fleury is the second most effective NHL player in the league , with 10 points -LRB- 4 goals and 6 assists -RRB- in only six games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;5	Swede Michael Nylander , Fleury 's preseason linemate for the Flames , has 20 points -LRB- 8-12 -RRB- in 10 games .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;6	On Thursday , Nylander scored and assisted on both goals for JyP HT of Jyvaskyla .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;7	But TuTo of Turku won its third straight , 3-2 , with the second successive overtime winner by Risto Siltanen , a defenseman for the Edmonton Oilers in the early 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;8	Teppo Numminen , a Winnipeg defenseman , assisted on the clincher .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;9	Geoff Sanderson of Hartford scored for HPK Hameenlinna , but his team lost 5-2 to Lukko of Rauma .
APW_ENG_19941201.0608;10	Mikko Makela , an NHL veteran returning to the league to play for the Boston Bruins after seasons in Finland and Sweden , scored as Ilves of Tampere downed reigning champion and league leader Jokerit of Helsinki 5-1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;0	Prime Minister Paul Keating 's Labor government faces a problem that most national leaders would envy : a booming economy growing faster than that of any other developed nation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;1	The Australian economy , which only a year ago still lingered in the doldrums of recession , may be overheating and heading for a boom-bust cycle , economists , executives and the conservative opposition say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;2	If that 's true , Keating will be compelled to give up 1996 tax cuts he promised the public when he was elected last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;3	In fact , Keating is already sending signals that higher taxes are on the way .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;4	Interest rates may also be boosted to restrain the economy , another move that would rub voters raw by increasing mortgage lending rates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;5	Keating must call a general election by May 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;6	With the opposition at a record low in the polls , there has been speculation Keating would take advantage of that to call an early election in the first months of 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;7	But if Keating 's government has to load tax hikes rather than cuts on the public , and raise interest rates , he probably will want to wait and let tempers cool off .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;8	The clearest sign of an overheated economy emerged this week with economic growth hitting a rate of 6.4 percent a year , the highest in the developed world , coupled with low inflation of about 1 percent a year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;9	Six months ago , the government had forecast a 4 percent growth rate , and warned anything over 5 percent could not be sustained .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;10	Treasurer Ralph Willis rejected opposition calls for cuts in government spending of up to dlrs 11 billion -LRB- dlrs 8.4 billion U.S. -RRB- , saying instead : `` It would be more than likely we would have to move into consideration of taxes rather than putting all the emphasis on outlays . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;11	Keating , after having promised 1996 tax cuts , could n't quite bring himself to utter the T-word .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;12	But Thursday night , he signalled that tax hikes were the way to go by endorsing Willis ' remarks .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;13	Trade Minister Bob McMullan said Friday that Australians would vote for a government that introduced higher taxes if it was the right decision for the country .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;14	`` If we make a decision whether it 's about taxes or something else that 's on the face of it unpopular but good for the country , they 'll vote for it , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;15	But Alexander Downer , the leader of the opposition Liberal-National Party coalition , vows to fight any tax increases .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;16	He obviously relishes a chance to campaign against the Labor Party 's purported `` tax-and-spend '' policies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;17	Long - and short-term rates on the Australian financial markets jumped when the growth figures came out , reflecting fears that overheated growth would spur inflation , prodding the government to increase interest rates to cope with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;18	The Reserve Bank meets against next week , and many economists are expecting another increase in interest rates , which would be the third in recent months .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;19	That would raise the average monthly mortgage rate by dlrs 114 -LRB- dlrs 87 U.S. -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;20	Keating , Willis , McMullen and other administration leaders insist they 've got the situation well in hand and the public need not worry .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;21	After all , they point out that inflation is still low , unemployment is declining , business investment in the economy has rebounded since the recession .
APW_ENG_19941201.0609;22	`` We do n't need to run around in a great panic about the fact that the economy is blowing its head off , '' Willis said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;0	Former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield , intending to resume his career despite a recent heart problem , has fired manager Shelly Finkel , who opposes the comeback .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;1	Finkel has been in Holyfield 's camp since 1984 and has played a prominent role since the fighter fired business manager Ken Sanders in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;2	Finkel received his dismissal letter Monday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;3	Holyfield , 32 , has been on medical suspension because of a heart problem .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;4	Last month he received medical clearance to fight again by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;5	Finkel , who still manages a handful of fighters , most notably Pernell Whitaker , has said it is unwise for Holyfield to return to the ring .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;6	He said Wednesday he was neither surprised nor bitter about the split , although he said the manner in which the firing was handled was unusual .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;7	`` The letter basically said , ` I wo n't be using your services .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;8	You 've been a great manager and a real good friend , ' and had all these compliments , '' Finkel said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;9	`` There 's no hard feelings on my part .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;10	I 've seen it coming .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;11	It -LRB- continuing as manager -RRB- was n't appropriate because I 've been against him fighting again .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;12	I 'm sure it caused a gulf between us . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;13	Holyfield could not be reached for comment Wednesday and his spokesman , Ron Bell , declined to comment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0610;14	Holyfield hopes to be removed from boxing 's medical suspension list and licensed by the Nevada State Athletic Commission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;0	The ex-wife of a man accused of killing seven backpackers testified Friday that he was `` gun crazy '' and often carried a loaded pistol in his sock .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;1	Ivan Milat , 49 , who is accused of Australia 's backpacker killings , knew the forest where the bodies of the seven victims were found and had gone kangaroo shooting there , she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;2	The woman , who said she had met Milat in 1975 , married him in 1984 , and separated three years later before they divorced in 1989 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;3	She testified in a pre-trial hearing that will determine if there is enough evidence to try Milat in the case that has stunned Australia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;4	The magistrate has ordered media not to disclose her identity .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;5	She told Campbelltown Local Court that Milat had taken her and her son to the Belanglo State Forest in the New South Wales Southern Highlands , where he shot two kangaroos .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;6	`` Ivan pulled out a rifle , shot the first kangaroo , shot the second kangaroo , slit its throat and kicked it to make sure it was dead , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;7	Milat would often go shooting with his brothers at a property at the Wombeyan Caves bushland where he would `` shoot at anything he could find , '' she said , calling him `` gun crazy . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;8	When he was arrested in May , Milat was videotaped denying that owned a gun .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;9	Milat was charged in May in the slayings of Australian couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist , both 19 ; German backpackers Simone Schmidl , 21 , Gabor Neugebauer , 21 , and Anja Habschied , 20 ; and British backpackers Caroline Clarke , 21 , and Joanne Walters , 22 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;10	Their bodies were found between September 1992 and November 1993 in the Belanglo State Forest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;11	Milat is also charged with attempted murder , armed robbery and firearms offenses .
APW_ENG_19941201.0611;12	If convicted of murder , he could face life imprisonment .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;0	A ferry carrying more than 500 people collided with a Singapore-registered freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 13 people , the Coast Guard reported .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;1	Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Amado Samante said 289 other passengers were rescued .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;2	The president of the shipping company said 398 people have been rescued but gave no details of casualties .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;3	The dead included 11-month-old Jade Gonzales , said mother Imelda , 26 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;4	She said another son , aged five , was fine but her 3-year-old son was missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;5	`` We were sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;6	Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;7	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;8	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' said survivor Erwin Maravilla .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;9	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;10	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;11	He was one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;12	The Singapore-registered Kota Suria , with a crew of 26 , suffered damage to its bow but was joining the rescue effort .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;13	There was no immediate cause reported for the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;14	The ferry , the Cebu City , sank 30 minutes after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;15	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;16	At least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were trying to recover survivors , it said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;17	The Cebu City had a capacity of 800 pasengers , said a spokesman for the Williams Lines shipping company .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;18	In December of 1987 the Philippines suffered the worst-ever peacetime ferry disaster , when 3,537 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;19	The Cebu City sank near the mouth of Manila Bay near the town of Maragondon , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941201.0612;20	It had left the port of Manila bound for Tagbilaran , capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .

APW_ENG_19941201.0614;3	Satoshi Soda , a Sakura Bank dealer , said the currency moved narrowly as many players remained on the sidelines ahead of the release later in the day of November U.S. employment data .
APW_ENG_19941201.0614;4	The dollar 's stability followed its advance Thursday in New York , where the currency rose to a seven-week high as a spate of strong economic figures provided expectations of a further rise in key U.S. interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941201.0614;5	Among data released Thursday , the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated U.S. manufacturing rose in November to the strongest level in 10 years .

APW_ENG_19941201.0615;0	A United Nations protest to Bosnian Serbs for detaining peacekeepers and attacking a Canadian camp sparked a response from the Serbs ' top general , a spokeswoman said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;1	Officials declined to comment Thursday on the contents of two Serb letters , saying they came at a `` sensitive '' time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;2	But sources said the response was n't specific enough for UN leaders trying to restart talks on releasing more than 400 UN troops , including 55 Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;3	The letters -- from Gen. Ratko Mladic , Serb army commander , and one of his assistants -- went to Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;4	Bertrand Guillaume de Lapresle , UN commander in the former Yugoslavia , and his deputy , Canadian Maj.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;5	Raymond Crabbe , said Canadian spokeswoman Maj. Rita LePage .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;6	Earlier this week , Lapresle and Crabbe wrote to the Serbs protesting the holding of UN troops and a Serb rocket attack on the Canadian camp in Visoko on Sunday , which damaged a building .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;7	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , in Paris on Thursday for a world conference on AIDS , said the troops ' detention is unacceptable but little progress has been made in efforts to win their release .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;8	`` They are detained , you can call it hostages .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;9	... But I would not fight on the meaning of words here . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;10	Earlier , in a speech to the French Senate , Chretien said NATO allies will try to solve the crisis in talks in Budapest next week with former Soviet bloc countries .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;11	Meanwhile , UN officials tried to schedule talks near Sarajevo on releasing the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;12	Lapresle and Yasushi Akashi , the top UN civilian envoy in Bosnia , were to meet today with Mladic and Radovan Karadzic , political leader of Bosnia 's Serbs , at the Bosnian Serb headquarters of Pale .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;13	In Sarajevo , Reuters quoted UN officials as saying they believed Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;14	Sir Michael Rose , the UN commander in Bosnia , had won pledges in talks with Serb leaders in Pale to release the detained peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;15	The report could not be confirmed .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;16	Jan-Dirk Merveldt , a UN spokesman in Zagreb , Croatia , said Rose was optimistic the detainees would be released soon and quoted Rose as saying Karadzic promised action on the detainees , perhaps by today .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;17	But Merveldt also said promises from Karadzic have not been kept in the past .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;18	Optimism was dampened when Bosnian Serb forces were reported to have crossed into Croatia on Tuesday , kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers and took them to Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;19	Serbs also blocked food convoys , fired missiles at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and traded fire with government troops around Bihac , a UN-designated safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;20	The 55 Canadians have been held for more than a week at various locations near Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;21	A camp supply vehicle reached the Canadians on Wednesday night with books , mail and personal items .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;22	Life at the Canadian camp gradually returned to normal Thursday , a day after a Serb threat to shell the camp passed without incident .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;23	But the camp stayed at the high alert level of orange Thursday , which requires personnel to wear flak jackets and helmets when outside .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;24	In Brussels , NATO foreign ministers gathered to seek terms for a ceasefire as western allies argued over how NATO and the UN should handle the war .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;25	Officials in Bonn confirmed that NATO has asked Germany to contribute fighter planes to patrol over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0615;26	That would put Germany 's military in its first combat role in 49 years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;0	The judge in the O.J. Simpson case dismissed three jury prospects Thursday who acknowledged hearing that Nicole Brown Simpson 's sister has publicly branded Simpson a killer .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;1	`` I think I heard Simpson 's sister-in-law say he was going to kill her ... Nicole , '' one of the three prospective alternate jurors told Superior Court Judge Lance Ito .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;2	All three were dismissed as Ito continued his search for 15 alternate jurors to join the 12 jurors who have already been selected to hear the case .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;3	In recent days , a feud has erupted between the Simpson defense and relatives of Simpson 's ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman , who were knifed to death outside her condominium June 12 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;4	Simpson , a former football legend , television sports commentator and movie star , has pleaded innocent to murder charges in the slayings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;5	Defense lawyers Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran Jr. have accused Ms. Simpson 's sister , Denise Brown , of orchestrating an effort to deny Simpson a fair trial by repeatedly accusing him in media interviews of killing her sister .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;6	On Thursday , Shapiro said he would try to limit his public comments to temper the `` media madness . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;7	`` In the spirit of trying to accomplish what we all want , we are going to take the high road , '' Shapiro said outside court .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;8	`` We no longer are going to be talking to the press on a daily basis .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;9	... We hope everybody else takes the road with us . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;10	In New York , a judge rebuked Ito for scheduling a hearing on DNA evidence at a time when Simpson 's DNA expert , Peter Neufeld , is supposed to be representing a murder defendant in his courtroom .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;11	Justice Harold Rothwax rebuffed Neufeld 's renewed effort to delay the trial and ordered the lawyer to appear in his court Monday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;12	Rothwax criticized Ito for ordering Neufeld to appear at the DNA hearing in Los Angeles on Dec. 12 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;13	`` It 's inexplicable to me that Judge Ito would issue an order that he refused to issue two weeks ago , '' Rothwax said , adding that he believed Ito had done so at Shapiro 's request .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;14	`` It 's clear to me that what Mr. Shapiro is trying to do is put Mr. Simpson 's interests before the interests of the people of New York , '' Rothwax said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0616;15	Neufeld hired lawyer William Kunstler to represent him in the tug-of-war , and Kunstler said he 'll ask a federal judge on Friday to throw out Rothwax 's order .
APW_ENG_19941201.0617;0	Boeing Co. and China Aviation Supplies Corp. have opened a spare parts center at Beijing 's airport , a report said Friday .

APW_ENG_19941201.0618;0	Citizens in the Maldives archipelago voted Friday to elect a new 48-member Parliament which has little say in the Indian Ocean islands ' administration that is controlled by the President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;1	Forty lawmakers will be elected by the 109,072 voters in the daylong poll , while Gayoom will appoint eight others .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;2	The results of the elections , held once in five years , will be known in six days , since the ballot boxes have to be ferried by boats from 19 atolls to the capital Male for counting .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;3	Gayoom , who has ruled the nation comprising 1,196 Indian Ocean coral islands since 1978 , has promised to share powers with parliament , but there has n't been any transfer so far .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;4	Serving his fourth term in office , Gayoom has instead banned political parties and crushed all forms of opposition to him by banishing dissenters to uninhabited islands .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;5	But for the first time , many of the 248 candidates contesting the polls were publicly canvassing for votes this year , promising democracy , said a Maldivian diplomat in Colombo .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;6	The candidates had put up banners and posters , promising to fight for the rights of the people , said a Colombo-based Maldivian diplomat on condition of anonymity .

APW_ENG_19941201.0618;11	About 55 islands have been developed as tourist resorts , which provide most of the nation 's earnings .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;12	The country also exports fish and garments .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;13	The Maldives remained a sultanate until 1897 when it was colonized by the British .
APW_ENG_19941201.0618;14	It won independence in 1965 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;0	China 's leaders are united behind an economic plan for 1995 to control the rapidly growing economy and curb runaway inflation , the country 's newspapers reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;1	The announcement that reforms would continue with no major changes followed four days of closed meetings on economic problems by top Communist Party leaders .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;2	`` China will continue to strengthen macroeconomic control over the national economy in order to seek a sustainable , rapid and healthy economic development next year , '' the Xinhua News Agency said in summing up the meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council , or Cabinet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;3	The latest announcement was placed on front pages of all major newspapers Friday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;4	Continuing policies include strict control of bank credit , the reports said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;5	China 's leaders already had announced that controlling inflation , now running over 20 percent , and reforming failing state enterprises would be top goals for the new year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;6	State-run industries account for about half of China 's industrial output , and just under half of them have been losing money .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;7	Fearing social instability , the government has so far stopped short of massive layoffs or cutting social services tied to state jobs .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;8	The growth rate this year has been over 11 percent .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;9	Other priorities listed in the latest economic plan included more spending on agriculture to ensure adequate food production .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;10	In an editorial on Friday , the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the party , outlined some of the economic problems facing China .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;11	The gap is growing between rich industrial areas and poor , rural inland areas , it noted .
APW_ENG_19941201.0619;12	In addition , high inflation for the past two years has aroused concern throughout society , it said , warning that while some inflation during rapid economic growth was unavoidable , too much was dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;0	Norway overcame an 11-second deficit to beat out Japan in a Nordic combined sprint relay and win the team event Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;1	The United States finished third , its first medal in a Nordic combined sprint relay and the first Nordic combined medal of any kind for the United States since 1983 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;2	`` I understand now what it takes to be an Olympic champion and World Cup champion .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;3	These guys -LRB- the Norwegians -RRB- have worked very hard and hopefully in a few years I 'll be the same caliber as they are , '' said American Todd Lodwick , who posted jumps of 112 and 112.5 meters to top the Americans in that phase .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;4	`` This is the first time I 've ever been on a World Cup podium and it 's pretty damn exciting . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;5	The Norwegian victory produced a double for Knut Tore Apeland , who won the individual event on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;6	His teammate , 1994 Olympic individual champion Fred Boerre Lundberg , added the team gold to the bronze he won Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;7	`` You never know in cross-country , '' Lundberg said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;8	`` You could break a ski or ski off the track , but , yes , if everything was OK we were quite sure of winning . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;9	Japan 's Takanori Kono and Tsuguhara Ogiwara won the jumping phase Thursday afternoon with 463.6 points to Norway 's 460.1 and 448.4 for Lodwick and teammate Ryan Heckman .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;10	Under the scoring system used for Nordic combined , jump points are converted into a time penalty used for the start of the cross-country race .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;11	That meant that Norway would start 11 seconds behind Japan , with the Americans another 35 seconds behind .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;12	Midway through Norway 's second 1.2-kilometer lap , Lundberg went past Ogiwara on an uphill section and began to pull away .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;13	At the end of 15 kilometers , the Norwegians were almost a minute ahead .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;14	Norway completed both events in an adjusted time of 35 minutes , 31.1 seconds .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;15	Japan hit the finish in 36:30.2 and the United States in 38:14.1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;16	Making the biggest move among the 13 teams was Finland , which moved from ninth in the jumps to fourth overall , 44 seconds behind the United States .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;17	The Finns posted the fastest time in the relay .
APW_ENG_19941201.0621;18	The Czech Republic , Switzerland , a second Japanese team , Austria , France and Germany rounded out the top 10 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;0	China for the first time listed its top 300 joint-stock companies on Friday , with Shanghai Petrochemical Co. at the top .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;1	The list is based on a survey of the performance of the nearly 20,000 joint-stock companies across China , the China Daily said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;2	The newspaper did n't spell out in detail how it made the rankings but said profits and gross assets were the two major gauges of the companies ' performance .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;3	The Fujian Jiuzhou Group Co.
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;4	Ltd. was the top joint-stock company in the trade sector , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;5	Included in the list were 23 companies whose annual sales exceeded 2 billion yuan -LRB- dlrs 235 million -RRB- last year .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;6	Of the 300 top joint stock companies , 107 ranked among the China 's 500 largest enterprises .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;7	The shares of 51 percent of the 300 companies are listed in Shenzhen or Shanghai .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;8	Some of the companies have issued shares only to staff members or business partners .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;9	The report quoted Hong Hu , a State Commission for Economic Restructuring official , as saying the survey showed the vitality of the shareholding system , paving the way for the reform of China 's state-owned enterprises .
APW_ENG_19941201.0623;10	Regular monitoring of the share-holding system will help improve companies ' economic performance and will make investors in China 's fledgling stock markets more confident , Fu Fengxiang of the China Securities Regulatory Commission said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;0	Michael Jackson is trying to end his 6-month-old marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , news reports in New York and London said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;1	But the official word from one half of the celebrity couple is that the reports are simply false .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;2	`` Once again , the media is being very irresponsible and spreading false rumors , '' Mrs. Jackson-Presley said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;3	`` Michael and I are very happily married .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;4	... These rumors , in spite of their wishful and destructive thinking , are totally unfounded and false . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;5	The separation speculation comes just after the couple 's six-month anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;6	Jackson biographer Christopher Andersen said he first heard rumors of a split on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;7	`` I had heard their lawyers were actually talking annulment , '' said the author of `` Michael Jackson Unauthorized . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;8	Lisa Marie and Michael were married in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic in May , but rumors about the marriage were n't confirmed until August .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;9	Speculation that the marriage is at best a union of convenience and at worst a publicity ploy started immediately .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;10	Jackson was under investigation for child molestation .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;11	The case was dropped in September .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;12	`` Are Michael and Lisa Marie friends ?
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;13	Sure -- they 've been friends for a long time .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;14	But that 's not a marriage , '' Andersen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;15	The current rumors come in several versions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;16	Andersen says the marriage was `` a scam '' from Day 1 , and now Lisa Marie wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;17	Gossip columnist Liz Smith intimates Michael viewed the nuptials as a `` public relations coup , '' but Lisa Marie fell in love and now Michael wants out .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;18	Another Jacksonphile , author J. Randy Taraborrelli , blames the split on Lisa 's refusal to move to the East Coast and live with Michael in his Trump Tower apartment in New York .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;19	Whatever the reason , it seems only a few people expect the Jacksons to be exchanging the traditional silverware on their 25th anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;20	Or , for that matter , paper on anniversary No. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;21	`` I did say the marriage would be over by the end of the year , '' Andersen said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0624;22	`` Not that I want to say I told you so . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;0	The once grand idea of U.N. peacekeeping as a global 911 appears to be fading as the United Nations closes shop in Somalia and faces humiliation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;1	With the United Nations in apparent retreat , observers are saying that future peacekeeping is likely to shy away from where it is needed most : the front lines .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;2	Bosnia is a `` bucket of cold water on ambitious plans for peacekeeping , '' said Richard Betts , professor of political science at Columbia University .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;3	`` I think there is a great future for peacekeeping that does not matter very much , and a very shaky future for messier operations . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;4	That seemed apparent this week .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;5	As Serb militiamen held hundreds of peacekeepers hostage and pounded a U.N.-declared safe haven in Bosnia , the Security Council met in New York , but high on its agenda was the Golan Heights , not Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;6	The quick meeting extending the mandate for the Israeli-Syrian border mission highlighted a U.N. success -- a mission where both sides want peace and the border is quiet .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;7	The council talks later dragged on about Bosnia , but without direct action .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;8	`` Peacekeeping is the role of referee , '' said Dan Plesch , director of the British-American Security Information Council in London .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;9	`` You can separate warring parties who want to be separated . ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;10	But in instances like Bosnia and Somalia , where the sides are n't willing to stop fighting , the United Nations is refusing to order its peacekeepers to separate the sides .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;11	Such a direct role would be war , not peacekeeping , council members say .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;12	Many observers say missions like those in Golan and Cyprus -- with clear and limited objectives such as monitoring borders or delivering aid to war zones -- are likely to expand in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;13	`` But we will also see peacekeeping used by the United States and other powers as a way of repackaging war , '' Plesch said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;14	He cited Haiti and Georgia as examples .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;15	The United States pushed the Council to authorize military intervention in Haiti , offering its own soldiers to lead the mission that will give way to a U.N. peacekeeping force .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;16	Russia would like to do much the same in Georgia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;17	It has already sent its own troops to the former Soviet republic , but is pressing the United Nations to take over the mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;18	While Bosnia -- with 24,000 soldiers or almost a third of all U.N. peacekeepers -- would prove the greatest U.N. peacekeeping failure if it collapses , the United Nations has lost face on other missions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;19	It was unable to foster peace in Somalia , and decided this fall to wind down its two-year mission .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;20	In Liberia , observers have been abused and humiliated by the warring factions .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;21	U.N. officials bristle at criticisms that peacekeeping has been ineffective and say the problem is that world leaders are not willing to commit the troops or money to ambitious peacekeeping operations .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;22	The world body is being made a scapegoat for the lack of global will to act , said Kofi Annan , the head of U.N. peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;23	`` It is absolutely unfair when member states do not want to take the risks , when they do not want to commit the resources , but blame the U.N. for failure to act , '' Annan said .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;24	U.N. peacekeeping costs have ballooned to $ 3.8 billion for the year ending April 1994 , but by October , members still owed the world body $ 1.6 billion for peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;25	There are some 80,000 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;26	U.N. missions involved only about 10,000 soldiers in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;27	With a more isolationist Congress coming into power in Washington , it is unlikely the United States -- which pays about a third of the peacekeeping budget -- would be willing to pay for additional operations that are not directly in the U.S. interest .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;28	`` There may be other Bosnias , but I do n't think there will be another UNPROFOR , '' said William Durch , a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;29	`` If the West is not willing to act on its own doorstep why would it do it elsewhere ? ''
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;30	UNPROFOR is the peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;31	Lewis MacKenzie , a veteran of nine peacekeeping operations and the former head of the Sarajevo operation , points out that despite its shortcomings , the U.N. mission in Bosnia still ensures that millions of people receive food every day .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;32	And the retired major-general says that despite the problems , there is still a need for peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941201.0625;33	`` People who talks about the loss of credibility will be on bended knees before the U.N. at the next crisis , '' MacKenzie said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;0	A parole board on Thursday rejected Sirhan Sirhan 's ninth attempt to be freed from a life sentence for assassinating presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;1	Sirhan , who attended the hearing under guard but without wearing handcuffs or other restraints , showed no emotion at the denial after two hours of hearing and deliberations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;2	The panel said he would be reconsidered for parole in two years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;3	Parole is normally granted to inmates deemed to have been sufficiently rehabilitated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;4	Sirhan , now 50 , shot Kennedy as the New York senator walked through the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5 , 1968 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;5	Kennedy , whose brother , President John F. Kennedy , was assassinated in 1963 , had just won California 's Democratic presidential primary and finished thanking supporters moments before he was shot .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;6	He died the next day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;7	Sirhan , a Christian Arab born in Jerusalem , said later that he was mad at Kennedy for supporting a shipment of 50 Phantom jets to Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;8	In 1969 , Sirhan was sentenced to die in California 's gas chamber , but the state Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the death penalty law in effect then .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;9	That left Sirhan with a life sentence and the right to seek parole .
APW_ENG_19941202.0001;10	Sirhan is jailed at a special housing unit at California State Prison-Corcoran , 200 miles -LRB- 320 kilometers -RRB- north of Los Angeles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;0	Cris Carter turned Warren Moon 's short pass into a 65-yard touchdown in overtime Thursday night , giving the Minnesota Vikings a 33-27 victory over the Chicago Bears and a tie for the lead in the NFC Central .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;1	Moon 's second scoring pass to Carter , 5:46 into the extra period , came two plays after Kevin Butler missed a 40-yard field goal that would have given the Bears -LRB- 8-5 -RRB- their second overtime win in two weeks and a two-game lead in the division .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;2	Instead , the Vikings -LRB- 8-5 -RRB- took control of the division , thanks to their season sweep of the Bears .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;3	After the Bears drove to the Minnesota 23 , Butler was wide left on his kick .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;4	Then Moon and Carter went to work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;5	On second down , Moon threw into the flat to Carter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;6	He spun away from linebacker Joe Cain , straddled the sideline for a few steps and avoided a desperation tackle attempt by Shaun Gayle at the 10 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;7	He stumbled into the end zone standing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;8	`` It was curl pattern trying to set up a field goal , '' Carter said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;9	`` Warren made a good throw . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;10	Said Moon : `` Cris did a great job lulling the linebacker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;11	I did n't get it out there as far as I would have liked .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;12	It was a great individual effort . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;13	Minnesota snapped a three-game losing streak , handing Chicago its first loss in five games and its first defeat in eight games this season with Steve Walsh as the starting quarterback .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;14	Walsh , returning home on his 28th birthday , threw two touchdowns , but his first quarter interception was returned 54 yards by rookie Dewayne Washington to give the Vikings a 7-0 lead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;15	The Bears led 24-16 on Walsh 's second TD pass , a 15-yarder to Greg McMurtry with 1:30 left in the third quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;16	But the Vikings rallied with Fuad Reveiz 's fourth field goal and Moon 's 1-yard fourth-down TD pass to Carter , the NFL 's leading receiver , and a 2-point conversion pass to Andrew Jordan for a 27-24 lead with 4:12 left in regulation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;17	Butler tied it with 1:55 left , and had a chance for his second game-winning overtime kick in two weeks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;18	But his 40-yard kick just sailed wide left .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;19	Minnesota , meanwhile , has thrived in the season 's last month under Dennis Green , who never has lost to the Bears in six games since he became head coach in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;20	Green is 6-3 in December , including a 4-1 finish last year after the Vikings entered the final month 5-6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;21	There were four lead changes in the second half , the first on Jeff Graham 's 61-yard punt return that gave Chicago a 14-13 lead 2:05 into the third quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;22	Chicago led 17-16 before Qadry Ismail fumbled a kick return to set up Walsh 's 15-yard TD pass to McMurtry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;23	Walsh finished 24 of 33 for 233 yards -- his highest total of the season -- along with the two TDs and interception .
APW_ENG_19941202.0002;24	The Bears ' 27 points were the most they 've scored this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;0	A ferry carrying more than 500 people collided with a Singapore-registered freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 17 people , the Coast Guard reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;1	Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Amado Samante said 449 other passengers had been rescued and the search was continuing for others .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;2	The dead included 11-month-old Jade Gonzales , said his mother Imelda , 26 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;3	She said another son , aged five , was fine but her 3-year-old son was missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;4	Another survivor , Erwin Maravilla , described the terrifying scene after the two ships hit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;5	`` We were sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;6	Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;7	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;8	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;9	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;10	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;11	He was one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;12	The 12,500-ton , Singapore-registered Kota Suria , with a crew of 26 , suffered damage to its port bow but was joining the rescue effort , carrying 230 of those saved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;13	There was no immediate cause reported for the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;14	The 2,452-ton ferry , the Cebu City , sank 30 minutes after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;15	Maximo Calamba , 38 , who survived the accident with wife Veneranda , 30 , and one-year-old son Marcelo , complained that the ferry crew failed to inform them about the approaching freighter and did not help people evacuate the ship after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;16	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;17	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own , '' Calamba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;18	`` When we were rescued by the Suria I could still hear crying out for help . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;19	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0004;20	At least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were trying to recover survivors , it said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0005;0	If fighting intensfies in Bosnia , the Swedish government is prepared to withdraw its U.N. peacekeepers at short notice , news reports said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;1	`` If the fighting increases , we could end up in a situation where there is no alternative but to withdraw the U.N.-peacekeepers , '' Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;2	`` As every responsible government we have drawn up plans for this , '' Hjelm-Wallen added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;3	Peacekeepers from several countries are virtually hostage in several parts of Bosnia and there are reports that their food and fuel supplies are running low .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;4	`` This shows how serious the situation is , '' Hjelm-Wallen said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;5	Sweden has 1,256 peacekeepers in Bosnia , most are based near Tuzla and form part of the joint Nordic batallion NORDBAT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;6	Hjelm-Wallen will participate at a meeting in Brussels later Friday , where members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will discuss the Bosnian situation .

APW_ENG_19941202.0005;8	Sweden is part of the PFP-initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;9	Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson has refused to comment how fast a Swedish withdrawal could take place , but said that there are contingency plans for a rapid withdrawl .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;10	These include flying out the peacekeepers from Tuzla airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0005;11	The issue is closely monitored with neighboring Norway and Denmark , Carlsson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;0	Lucien Bouchard , a central and charismatic leader of Quebec 's separatist movement , had his left leg amputated two days after being hospitalized for a blood clot that became infected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;1	Bouchard 's emergency hospitalization throws into doubt the role the Bloc Quebecois leader will play in next year 's critical referendum on separation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;2	French-speaking Quebec has long sought some form of sovereignty or separation from the rest of Canada , which is largely English-speaking .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;3	Bouchard , 55 , was in serious but stable condition Thursday after two operations at Montreal 's Saint-Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;4	Radio-Canada reported late Thursday that doctors first amputated Bouchard 's foot and then his leg .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;5	Bouchard 's doctor , Patrick D'Amico , said in a statement that the separatist leader developed an infection on his leg after being hospitalized on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;6	`` This situation necessitated two operations to drain and amputate the leg and control the infection , '' said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;7	Radio-Canada and CTV , a Canadian television network , reported that Bouchard has a rare flesh-eating disease which has been linked to about a dozen deaths in Britain , one in Canada and few in other countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;8	His doctors were reportedly conferring with specialists in Britain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;9	The rapidly-spreading disease is caused by a virulent form of streptococcus bacteria that enters the body through a cut or a wound and produces an infection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;10	Widely considered the most compelling Quebec separatist leader , the charismatic Bouchard 's absence from the upcoming referendum battle would be a blow to forces seeking Quebec 's secession .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;11	Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau prevailed on Bouchard to show the same courage he has regularly displayed in the political arena .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;12	`` Our prayers are with you , '' said a shaken Parizeau .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;13	`` I hope this will soon be just a bad dream .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;14	Hold on old friend . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;15	A Bloc Quebecois spokesman refused to provide more details on Bouchard 's condition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;16	Bouchard is with him now , '' Marthe Lawrence , Bouchard 's spokesperson , said from the hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;17	`` The family wishes no further statement for the moment . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0006;18	Bouchard became leader of the opposition after his fledgling party swept Quebec in the 1993 federal election , winning 54 out of 75 seats in the province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0007;0	At Milwaukee , the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a career-high 34 points by Todd Day to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 93-87 Thursday night .

APW_ENG_19941202.0007;2	Day had 23 points in the first quarter for the Bucks , who lost their fifth in a row .

APW_ENG_19941202.0007;7	Dallas pulled to within 86-80 with 1:22 to play on Jim Jackson 's basket , but that was as close as the Mavericks would come .
APW_ENG_19941202.0007;8	The Nuggets , who were without injured starters Reggie Williams and Bryant Stith , halted the Mavericks ' three-game winning streak .
APW_ENG_19941202.0007;9	Denver 's Dikembe Mutombo had 13 points , 14 rebounds and four blocked shots .

APW_ENG_19941202.0008;0	A lawyer is suing a restaurant that he claims served him a double espresso instead of decaffeinated coffee .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;1	Donald Horowitz said Thursday that the mix-up last December at the Teggiano Restaurant put him in the hospital with a rapid heart beat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;2	After a few sips , `` I developed chest pains and my heart started racing , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;3	Horowitz , 58 , who had a heart attack in 1991 , claims he still has heart trouble because of the espresso .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;4	He said he wants to serve notice on restaurants that such mix-ups will not be tolerated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;5	His lawsuit , filed Tuesday in Superior Court in Bergen County , names the South Hackensack restaurant and its insurance company .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;6	It seeks unspecified damages .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;7	Restaurant owner Luigi Bruno denied the claims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;8	He said his decaffeinated and regular coffees are kept apart to prevent mix-ups .
APW_ENG_19941202.0008;9	Horowitz said he was offered a `` trifling sum of money '' to settle the dispute but decided to file his lawsuit instead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;0	Japan 's lower house of parliament passed the GATT world trade accord Friday , virtually assuring the world 's second-largest economy would adopt the landmark deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;1	It also passed a six-year , 7.2 trillion yen -LRB- dlrs 74 billion -RRB- package of subsidies and aid to rural areas to quell farmers ' opposition to the accord , which opens Japan 's rice market for the first time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;2	After heavy U.S. pressure during GATT negotiations , four percent of the staple is to come from overseas starting in 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;3	The vote , which was not formally counted , came after the U.S. Senate , Congress ' upper house , approved the deal Thursday night by an overwhelming 76-24 vote .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;4	President Clinton hailed the Senate vote as a `` victory for America '' which would create millions of new jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;5	The accord , passed Tuesday by the House of Representatives , now needs his signature .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;6	Japanese trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said with U.S. approval of the deal , which slashes tariffs by 38 percent worldwide , other nations are much more likely vote in favor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;7	He predicted Japan 's upper house would follow the more powerful lower chamber 's lead and approve the accord in time for it to take effect as planned Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;8	Approval was expected next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;9	In Canberra , Australian trade minister Bob McMullan called the U.S. Senate passage `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;10	The parliament there was conducting debate Friday in moving closer to approving the deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0009;11	Under the plan , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will be superseded Jan. 1 by the stronger World Trade Organization as the world 's main arbiter of trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;0	Vietnam 's inflation rate rose to 13.2 percent during the first 11 months of the year , a report said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;1	Retail prices increased by 1.7 percent for the period ending Nov. 30 due in part to heavy floods in the Mekong River region , Vietnam 's biggest rice-growing area , the Saigon Newsreader reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;2	The floods caused temporary shortages and speculation that led to higher rice prices .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;3	Vietnam had hoped to keep inflation at less than 10 percent this year , but prices exceeded the target in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;4	Government officials have set a new goal of keeping inflation below 14 percent in 1994 , the paper reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;5	Official newspapers have tried to justify the higher than expected price increases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;6	They report , for example , that higher prices for rice mean better incomes for the four-fifths of the nation 's people who live by farming .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;7	International lenders such as the World Bank have praised Vietnam 's success in reigning in inflation , which reached 775 percent in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;8	Free market reforms since then have encouraged farmers and businessmen to produce more food and consumer goods to meet domestic demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;9	Inflation stood at 5.2 percent in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0011;10	Vietnam 's National Assembly has targeted a maximum inflation rate of 10 percent next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;0	Australia will pay Aborigines dlrs 13.5 million -LRB- U.S. dlrs 10 million -RRB- for damage British nuclear testing did to their land , the government said Friday after a decade of negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;1	Above-ground atomic test blasts were detonated on the vast Maralinga lands under British scientists ' direction in the 1950s and 1960s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;2	Aborigines were evicted from the land and have since fought to have the area cleaned up so they could return .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;3	Under the settlement , however , Australian primary industries minister Bob Collins said some of the 30,890-square-mile -LRB- 80,000 square kilometer -RRB- area in northern South Australia would remain closed indefinitely due to dangerous levels of plutonium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;4	The settlement will fund new outstations in Maralinga as well as health services , roads , water supplies and employment programs , Collins said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;5	An outstation is a cabin or settlement in the outback with a water pump as the main amenity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;6	Collins said `` it 's been a very sad chapter in our history and I 'm pleased to say that in human terms , at least one important bit of it has been brought to a close . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;7	The compensation is separate from the massive five-year task of cleaning up the land , expected to start early next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;8	Its cost is estimated at dlrs 104 million -LRB- U.S. dlrs 79 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;9	Archie Barton , administrator of the Maralinga Tjarutja lands , said Friday 's announcement ended `` 10 years of frustration , mental and physical strain on our older people . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;10	The bomb tests were kept secret until the early 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;11	Negotiations began after they became public .
APW_ENG_19941202.0012;12	An earlier British government settlement of 20 million pounds -LRB- U.S. dlrs 12.7 million -RRB- for the rehabilitation of the Maralinga lands signaled the end of its involvement in the compensation battle .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;0	Floris Jan Bovelander scored twice from first-half penalty corners to guide defending champion the Netherlands to a 3-1 victory over Australia on Friday and a place in the final of the World Cup field hockey tournament .

APW_ENG_19941202.0013;2	Top seed Australia got its only goal from Paul Gaudoin following a penalty corner 12 minutes into the second half .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;3	Bovelander took his tally for the tournament to five goals and also had a third penalty corner strike controversially disallowed in the second half after it was ruled the ball had not struck the backboard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;4	The Dutch , who advanced through the preliminary round unbeaten , dominated the semifinal for long periods and did not allow the Australian forwards room in which to be creative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;5	Erik Jazet was outstanding in defense , while captain Marc Delissen was a dynamo in midfield .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;6	The Netherlands now will play either Germany or Pakistan in Sunday 's final , while top seeded Australia failed to emulate its 1986 World Cup triumph .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;7	The Dutch now are unbeaten in their last 27 internationals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;8	They sealed their victory with a brilliant flowing attack .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;9	Teun de Nooijer and Taco van den Honert set up Brinkman with some slick stickwork and the inside-forward finished the move with an emphatic shot .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;10	`` We have a young team and a lot of people in Holland might be surprised we have made the final , '' said Delissen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;11	`` We 've proved we are a good side . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;12	Australian coach Frank Murray said his squad was `` very disappointed '' .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;13	`` They took their first two opportunities , but I thought we fought very well to get back at them , '' Murray said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;14	`` We came here to win the tournament and we did n't do that , so we have a lot of soul searching to do . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;15	England and India won consolation play-off games earlier Friday that assured them of top six finishes and places in the 1988 World Cup in the Netherlands and next year 's Champions Trophy tournament in Berlin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;16	India squandered a 2-0 first-half lead and was held to a 2-2 draw by Argentina before winning 4-1 on penalty strokes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;17	Goalkeeper Anjaparavanda Subbiah was the hero for India , making reflex saves to stop shots from Fernando Falchetti and Fernando Moresi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;18	He was chaired from the field by his delighted teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;19	`` It is immaterial to us who finishes fifth or sixth , '' said Indian coach Cedric D'Souza .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;20	`` What was important was that we finished in the top six .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;21	This was the most important match for us . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;22	Dhanraj Pillay and captain Jude Felix scored the goals for India , while Ferrara and Carlos Retegui replied for Argentina from penalty corners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;23	Penalty corner conversions by Rob Crutchley in the 13th and 20th minutes gave England a 2-0 halftime lead against South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;24	Jeon Jong-ha replied with a neat penalty corner variation six minutes after the break , but Russell Garcia converted a penalty stroke eight minutes from fulltime to seal the issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0013;25	The second semifinal between Olympic champion Germany and three-time World Cup winner Pakistan will be played later Friday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0014;2	The organization also announced that the 1996 Champions Trophy in Madras , India , would be switched from March to December to prevent a congestion of fixtures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0014;3	Berlin replaces Milton Keynes , England , as the 1995 venue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0014;4	Delays in the construction of the proposed hockey stadium at Milton Keynes forced England to forfeit the annual event .
APW_ENG_19941202.0014;5	Olympic champion Germany , trophy holder Pakistan , the Netherlands and Australia were assured of places in the Champions Trophy , along with England and India , who sealed places with top six finishes at the World Cup in Sydney .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;0	Chinese swimmers who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs may have been forced to take steroids or not even told what they were taking , U.S. swim officials say .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;1	`` They may -LRB- know -RRB- , but I 'm not sure they have a choice , '' Richard Quick , who will coach the U.S. women at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta , said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;2	`` It was said in East Germany that if you did n't follow the program , using the drugs as part of the program , that you were thrown out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;3	So you may not have a choice .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;4	And I think the young ones may not even know . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;5	Eleven Chinese athletes , seven of them swimmers , tested positive for drugs at the Asian Games at Hiroshima , Japan , in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;6	Chinese officials denied their swimming federation encouraged or knew about drug use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;7	`` This is an act by individuals , '' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday from Beijing , adding his country 's sports authorities practice `` strict prohibition , strict testing and strict punishment '' of drug use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;8	But Quick does n't believe it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;9	`` I think the coaches know , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;10	`` I think the administrators know .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;11	I think it would be impossible not to know that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;12	The Chinese swimming program has improved rapidly in the 1990s -- a little too rapidly , some say , as coaches from other countries began to suspect that steroids were part of the reason .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;13	Allegations of drug use escalated in September when the Chinese women won 12 of 16 gold medals at the world championships in Rome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;14	`` It seemed like too much , too fast , '' said Greg Eggert , a board member of the U.S. Swimming organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;15	Eggert said 17 countries , including the United States , signed a petition at the world championships asking the International Swimming Federation to develop a more rigorous drug-testing program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;16	In October , the Chinese women won all 15 of their races at the Asian Games .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;17	Then , seven of them tested positive .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;18	`` I 'm just glad to know that the testing system is working , '' said Skip Kenney , who will coach the U.S. men in Atlanta .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;19	`` I just think that when it 's fair , it just makes it that much more exciting . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;20	But John Collins , coach of the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont , N.Y. , said he 's waiting to see if the Chinese change their ways .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;21	`` Everybody knew that they 've been doing it , but we could n't catch them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;22	So the fact that they 're catching them is great , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;23	`` But I do n't know how it 's going to be resolved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;24	`` Considering the numbers of people caught , it 's obviously the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- federation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;25	They 're going to blame individual coaches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;26	They 're going to blame individual athletes , I 'm sure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0015;27	But the evidence shows it was a systematic problem . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0016;0	The U.S. dollar closed at 99.58 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market Friday , up 0.57 yen from Thursday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;0	Bosnian Serb leaders agreed to meet a top U.N. envoy today even as they ignored demands to free captive U.N. peacekeepers and allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to trapped civilians in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;1	The United Nations has pressing issues to discuss : Attempts to calm fighting in the Bihac region in northwest Bosnia , where Serbs forces have overrun Muslim villages in a U.N.-desigated `` safe area '' ; and the fate of more than 400 of its soldiers being held by the Serbs as insurance against NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;2	Seven more peacekeepers were seized Tuesday from an observation post in Croatia , across the border from Bihac , said Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;3	Bosnian Serb units entered Croatia and took the Ukrainian soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier back into Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;4	The United Nations has n't heard from the peacekeepers since , Ivanko said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;5	The observation post is now occupied by the Serbs , which allows them unimpeded movement of equipment and personnel from Serb-held parts of Croatia into Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;6	Serb rebels from the two countries have joined in an offensive to drive Muslim-led Bosnian government forces out of the Bihac region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;7	The fall of Bihac would allow rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia to join their territories .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;8	Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak warned Thursday that his country would not let that happen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;9	`` We are monitoring the situation , and if Croatia 's judgment is that Bihac is about to fall , Croatia will intervene , '' Susak said in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;10	Bosnian Serbs agreed to meet today with top U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;11	On Wednesday , they refused to meet U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali because he insisted talks be held in Sarajevo , capital of Bosnia 's internationally recognized government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;12	The Serbs agreed to today 's meeting after Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , traveled to Pale for talks with Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;13	But that session produced no apparent narrowing of differences to raise hopes of an end to the 2 -LCB- - year-long war , which has left 200,000 people dead or missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;14	Serbs again denied U.N. requests to supply the 70,000 civilians trapped in the Bihac enclave with food and other necessities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;15	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;16	The last U.N. food convoy reached Bihac on Oct. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;17	Hamdija Kabiljagic , the regional mayor , reported increased fighting along the perimeters of Bihac and shelling of the town itself Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;18	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , again rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;19	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;20	But the Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb dominion over the 70 percent of Bosnia they now control .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;21	An international peace plan the Serbs have rejected would give Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;22	Now that plan seems up for revision , as senior Western officials talk of allowing the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;23	In Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher hoped to get formal approval today from France , Britain , Germany and Russia for a new diplomatic initiative to achieve a cease-fire around Bihac , a pledge to stop fighting nationwide for three to six months , and an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0017;24	The Bosnian civil war began in April 1992 , when Bosnian Serbs rebelled against a vote by Bosnian Croats and Muslims to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;0	Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has tendered his resignation following a stormy Cabinet meeting in which he accused his opponents of trying to paralyze the government , aides said early Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;1	Speaking on condition of anonymity , the aides said the 51-year-old self-made Sunni Muslim billionaire , whose premiership was backed by Syria and Saudi Arabia , offered his resignation in a telephone call late Thursday night to President Elias Hrawi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;2	Hrawi , a Maronoite Catholic , had not yet accepted or rejected the resignation because it must first be made in writing , presumably later Friday , the aides said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;3	The resignation was triggered by a heated exchange between Hariri and Housing Minister Mahmoud Abu Hamdan , a SHiite Muslim , the aides said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;4	They reported that Hariri accused Hamdan and other opponents of seeking to sabotage all government-proposed legislation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;5	At one point , Hariri fumed that `` the country can not be ruled through militias , '' the aides quoted him as saying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;6	Hamdan is one of a group of ministers in the 30-member Cabinet who are aligned with Nabih Berri , the Shiite speaker of Parliament and head of the Amal movement , once a powerful militia in Lebanon 's 1975-1990 civil war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;7	Hariri 's critics accuse him of trying to enrich himself further by grabbing a large share of the multibillion-dollar postwar reconstruction projects for his own companies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;8	They also claim the tycoon , who has substantial real estate and engineering holdings , is trying to monopolize decision-making by ramming his decisions through the Cabinet , disregarding substantial internal opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;9	Earlier this year , Hariri staged a protest lasting several days during which he refused to attend government meetings as a way of demonstrating his frustration at the slowness of government action on reconstruction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;10	Hariri was appointed prime minister Oct. 22 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;11	At the time , he was hailed as Lebanon 's savior who would rescue the onetime `` Switzerland of the Middle East '' from economic oblivion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;12	The Lebanese hoped his image , untarnished by scandal as many of the country 's politicians were , as well as his wealth and his powerful Syrian and Saudi connections would help him achieve what previous governments had not : an economic turnaround to erase the war 's devastation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;13	His record has been mixed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;14	Much of war-ravaged central Beirut is being bulldozed as part of a massive reconstruction of the downtown area , designed to make the Lebanese capital once more a financial and trading hub for the region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;15	But the reconstruction has been slower than expected and Hariri 's critics have constantly accused him of seeking to use his position to line his own pockets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;16	Hariri built much of his dlrs 3 billion fortune in Saudi Arabia and enjoys a close friendship with the Saudi royal family .
APW_ENG_19941202.0018;17	According to a national covenant dating to independence from France in 1943 , Lebanon 's president is traditionally a Maronite Catholic , the Parliament speaker a Shiite and the prime minister a Sunni .
APW_ENG_19941202.0019;0	Great Britain fullback Jonathan Davies has signed to play for Australian rugby league team the North Queensland Cowboys next year , the Winfield Cup expansion team announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0019;1	Cowboys chief executive Kerry Boustead said former Welsh rugby union star Davies would join the club from English club Warrington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0019;2	Davies last played in Australia in 1991 , when he scored 100 points in 14 appearances for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0019;3	`` We are delighted to have signed him , he 's one of the finest players in the world , '' said Boustead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;0	The North American Free Trade Agreement has failed so far to deliver on its promise of more U.S. jobs and instead has resulted in a net loss of 10,000 jobs , according to a congressional analysis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;1	A Joint Economic Committee study requested by Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota estimates that while NAFTA created roughly 127,000 jobs in its first nine months , increased imports from Mexico have cost 137,000 U.S. jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;2	NAFTA , which went into effect this year , brought the United States , Mexico and Canada into a single trading bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;3	Dorgan issued the study as the Senate ratified the 124-nation accord negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;4	President Clinton , meanwhile , is expected to announce his intention next week to broaden NAFTA to include Chile and call for a hemispheric trade agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;5	`` NAFTA and GATT are trade agreements that make it easier for American jobs to go where labor is cheap , '' Dorgan said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;6	`` It 's a bankrupt trade strategy that weakens our country but strengthens corporations who want to employ cheap labor elsewhere and ship their goods here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;7	Commerce Department officials questioned the findings , saying their own analyses show job gains as a result of increased trade with Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;8	`` We are quite confident that NAFTA has been a net plus for jobs in 1994 , '' said Commerce 's chief economist , Lewis Alexander .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;9	Commerce officials questioned the study 's premise and the assumption that increased imports necessarily translate into job loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;10	The officials were reluctant to assign specific job gain numbers from NAFTA , saying it 's very difficult to separate the trade agreement 's effect on jobs from overall trade patterns with Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;11	Nine-month NAFTA figures released by Commerce last month showed U.S. exports to Mexico hit record levels , rising almost 22 percent over a year earlier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;12	Imports from Mexico were up almost 23 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;13	But opponents contend that NAFTA backers are ignoring the fact that the United States ' trade surplus with Mexico is shrinking .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;14	After hitting a high of dlrs 5.3 billion in 1992 , the trade surplus is expected to reach dlrs 2.8 billion this year if current trends hold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;15	The congressional study 's authors themselves expressed some discomfort with pinning job loss numbers at this early stage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0020;16	`` It will take at least five to 10 years for the full effects of the agreement to manifest themselves , '' they wrote .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;0	Expectations of another possible increase in U.S. interest rates boosted the U.S. dollar in Tokyo but pulled stock prices slightly lower Friday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0021;2	After opening at 99.40 yen , trades ranged between 99.38 and 99.59 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;3	The dollar 's stability followed its advance Thursday in New York , where it rose to a seven-week high as a spate of strong economic figures provided expectations of a further rise in key U.S. interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;4	Sakura Bank dealer Satoshi Soda said the currency moved narrowly as many players awaited the release later in the day of November U.S. employment data .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;5	If the data suggest persistent inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy , dealers believe that prospects for another rate hike might become stronger , thus increasing the return on some dollar-based investments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;6	The Federal Reserve , like other central banks , tends to raise interest rates in the believe if will lower inflationary pressures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;7	Attitudes have shifted since the central bank 's 0.75-percentage point hike on Nov. 15 , analysts say .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;8	On the stock market , the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.30 points , or 0.08 percent , to end the week at at 18,998.30 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0021;10	Stock prices closed lower in quiet trading as participants sat on the sidelines ahead of the release later in the day of U.S. employment figures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0021;11	Equity players fear that if the data suggest another increase in U.S. interest rates , Wall Street may again respond negatively , bringing down Tokyo stocks as well .

APW_ENG_19941202.0024;8	Hariri , 51 , was appointed prime minister Oct. 22 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0024;9	At the time , he was hailed as Lebanon 's savior who would rescue the onetime `` Switzerland of the Middle East '' from economic oblivion .

APW_ENG_19941202.0025;0	Author Robin Moore says he was surprised at how he easily obtained information in the former Soviet Union for his book about the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;1	Moore , 69 , the author of the `` French Connection '' and `` The Green Berets '' spoke Thursday at the Litchfield-Morris Rotary about his latest novel `` The Moscow Connection '' that grew out of a 1991 visit to Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;2	`` I was fascinated to find a new era of free speech , '' Moore told the group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;3	`` It seemed everything could be bought and sold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;4	You could even buy the KGB -- I did . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;5	The latest book is a thinly disguised work of fiction chronicling the rise and fall of the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;6	It was set in the wake of the failed coup that ended the reign of former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;7	The book grew out of an invitation by the Moscow police to do a positive story about the department .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;8	When he got there , Moore said , he found the department so riddled with corruption that a positive story was impossible .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;9	Instead , he made friends with some honest officers who steered him to his latest work with tales of the existence of a Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0025;10	Moore hopes his book will blow the lid off the burgeoning Russian mafia and what he says is its vigorous trade in the nuclear weaponry of the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;0	Australia will pay Aborigines dlrs 13.5 million -LRB- U.S. dlrs 10 million -RRB- for damage British nuclear testing did to their land , the government said Friday after a decade of negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;1	Above-ground atomic test blasts were detonated on the vast Maralinga lands under British scientists ' direction in the 1950s and 1960s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;2	Aborigines were evicted from the land and have since fought to have the area cleaned up so they could return .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;3	Under the settlement , however , Australian primary industries minister Bob Collins said some of the 30,890-square-mile -LRB- 80,000 square kilometer -RRB- area in northern South Australia would remain closed indefinitely due to dangerous levels of plutonium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;4	The settlement will fund new outstations in Maralinga as well as health services , roads , water supplies and employment programs , Collins said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;5	An outstation is a cabin or settlement in the outback with a water pump as the main amenity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;6	Collins said `` it 's been a very sad chapter in our history and I 'm pleased to say that in human terms , at least one important bit of it has been brought to a close . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;7	The compensation is separate from the massive five-year task of cleaning up the land , expected to start early next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;8	Its cost is estimated at dlrs 104 million -LRB- U.S. dlrs 79 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;9	Archie Barton , administrator of the Maralinga Tjarutja lands , said Friday 's announcement ended `` 10 years of frustration , mental and physical strain on our older people . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;10	The bomb tests were kept secret until the early 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;11	Negotiations began after they became public .
APW_ENG_19941202.0026;12	An earlier British government settlement of 20 million pounds -LRB- U.S. dlrs 31.2 million -RRB- for the rehabilitation of the Maralinga lands signaled the end of its involvement in the compensation battle .

APW_ENG_19941202.0029;6	At least 30 other scientists , businessmen and even a top police officer are involved in the affair , the reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0029;7	Newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying that the ring was working for Pakistan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0029;8	Both India and Pakistan , who have fought three wars since 1947 , are believed capable of producing nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0029;9	India is developing its own weapons delivery system , while Pakistan buys M-11 missiles from China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0029;10	Indian scientists have been developing rockets to launch communications satellites since 1979 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0030;6	At least 30 other scientists , businessmen and even a top police officer are involved in the affair , the reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;7	Newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying that the ring was working for Pakistan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;8	Both India and Pakistan , who have fought three wars since 1947 , are believed capable of producing nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;9	India is developing its own weapons delivery system , while Pakistan buys M-11 missiles from China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;10	Indian scientists have been developing rockets to launch communications satellites since 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;11	But the space laboratories also are involved in developing missile technology and have come under pressure from western countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0030;12	In 1992 , Russia 's Glavkosmos was forced to cancel a deal to supply rocket engines to India under pressure from Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;0	The once grand idea of U.N. peacekeeping as a global emergency police force appears to be fading as the United Nations closes shop in Somalia and faces humiliation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;1	With the United Nations in apparent retreat , observers are saying that future peacekeeping is likely to shy away from where it is needed most : the front lines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;2	Bosnia is a `` bucket of cold water on ambitious plans for peacekeeping , '' said Richard Betts , professor of political science at Columbia University in New York .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;3	`` I think there is a great future for peacekeeping that does not matter very much , and a very shaky future for messier operations . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;4	That seemed apparent this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;5	As Serb militiamen held hundreds of peacekeepers hostage and pounded a U.N.-declared safe haven in Bosnia , the Security Council met in New York , but high on its agenda was the Golan Heights , not Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;6	The quick meeting extending the mandate for the Israeli-Syrian border mission highlighted a U.N. success -- a mission where both sides want peace and the border is quiet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;7	The council talks later dragged on about Bosnia , but without direct action .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;8	`` Peacekeeping is the role of referee , '' said Dan Plesch , director of the British-American Security Information Council in London .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;9	`` You can separate warring parties who want to be separated . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;10	But in instances like Bosnia and Somalia , where the sides are n't willing to stop fighting , the United Nations is refusing to order its peacekeepers to separate the sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;11	Such a direct role would be war , not peacekeeping , council members say .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;12	Many observers say missions like those in Golan and Cyprus -- with clear and limited objectives such as monitoring borders or delivering aid to war zones -- are likely to expand in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;13	`` But we will also see peacekeeping used by the United States and other powers as a way of repackaging war , '' Plesch said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;14	He cited Haiti and Georgia as examples .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;15	The United States pushed the council to authorize military intervention in Haiti , offering its own soldiers to lead the mission that will give way to a U.N. peacekeeping force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;16	Russia would like to do much the same in Georgia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;17	It has already sent its own troops to the former Soviet republic , but is pressing the United Nations to take over the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;18	While Bosnia -- with 24,000 soldiers or almost a third of all U.N. peacekeepers -- would prove the greatest U.N. peacekeeping failure if it collapses , the United Nations has lost face on other missions .

APW_ENG_19941202.0031;20	In Liberia , observers have been abused and humiliated by the warring factions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;21	U.N. officials bristle at criticisms that peacekeeping has been ineffective and say the problem is that world leaders are not willing to commit the troops or money to ambitious peacekeeping operations .

APW_ENG_19941202.0031;23	`` It is absolutely unfair when member states do not want to take the risks , when they do not want to commit the resources , but blame the U.N. for failure to act , '' Annan said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;24	U.N. peacekeeping costs have ballooned to dlrs 3.8 billion for the year ending April 1994 , but by October , members still owed the world body dlrs 1.6 billion for peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;25	There are some 80,000 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;26	U.N. missions involved only about 10,000 soldiers in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0031;27	With a more isolationist Congress coming into power in Washington , it is unlikely the United States -- which pays about a third of the peacekeeping budget -- would be willing to pay for additional operations that are not directly in the U.S. interest .

APW_ENG_19941202.0033;0	NATO is ready to start building its program to admit former Cold War foes into the alliance , but the foundation received a strong new jolt from Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;1	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers on Thursday by backing out of a program tailored to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;2	Instead of endorsing a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts between NATO and Moscow , as he had been invited to Brussels to do , Kozyrev recited Russia 's worries about the Partnership for Peace program , a U.S. initiative proudly unveiled at a NATO summit last January .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;3	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told his dumbfounded audience , which had just agreed to a cautious , year-long project to draw up conditions for new members from the former Soviet bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;4	The foreign ministers were to meet today with their counterparts from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics to discuss the plan -- and Russia 's opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;5	Some diplomats thought Kozyrev 's message was really intended for the strong nationalist opposition back home in Russia , which fears the West is encroaching on Russia 's sphere of influence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;6	Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;7	Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc , NATO has anguished over whether -- and when -- to open its doors to its former foes in central and eastern Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;8	Poland , Hungary and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;9	The allies thought in the Partnership for Peace , they had found a formula pleasing both to East European supplicants and the wary Russians -- a sort of halfway house where former Soviet Bloc nations can take part in NATO military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;10	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;11	But Kozyrev warned that the Partnership threatened to create new divisions in Europe , with some participants destined to become NATO members , while others would remain on the outs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;12	`` Not all countries will be able to obtain membership at the same time , '' he protested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;13	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , tried to respond to Kozyrev 's remarks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;14	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO , '' he told the Russian minister just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;15	`` There is nothing new .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;16	We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;17	Kozyrev 's outburst was only the latest blow to the alliance , which has suffered unprecedented strains in recent weeks over a split between the United States and Europe over how NATO should deal with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0033;18	Attempting to heal the rift , Secretary of State Warren Christopher this week made a major policy switch , adopting the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;0	Test reject John Crawley scored a fiery unbeaten 91 Friday to spearhead England to a four-wicket win over a Sir Donald Bradman XI in a limited-overs cricket match at Bowral , southwest of Sydney .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;1	Crawley , who was left out of the team for the first Test against Australia , clubbed eight fours and a six as England scored a morale-boosting win against the team of young Australians led by former Test captain Allan Border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;2	The Bradman XI scored 205 for four in its allocated 50 overs and England reached the required total with just seven balls to spare .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;3	Crawley revived England 's hopes after tourists had slumped to 136 for six .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;4	He and Darren Gough added 72 runs off just 57 balls in an unbeaten seventh wicket stand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;5	Gough finished not out 24 , with one six and two fours .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;6	Earlier , Mike Atherton , Alec Stewart and Mike Gatting all made starts before throwing their wickets away .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;7	For the Bradman XI , Neil Maxwell had the best bowling figures of two for 2-26 from 9.5 overs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;8	Opener Jason Arnberger had ensured England would face a difficult chase when he top-scored for the home side with 79 against an ineffective attack .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;9	All the batsmen got starts , with Arnberger 's opening partner Jamie Cox scoring 42 , Jimmy Maher 26 and Shane Lee 27 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;10	Arnberger and Cox shared a century opening stand , the highlight of which was a big six from Cox off the bowling of spinner Shaun Udal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;11	England next faces the Australian Capital Territory in Canberra on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0034;12	Scores : Sir Donald Bradman XI 205-4 -LRB- Jason Arnberger 79 -RRB- .

APW_ENG_19941202.0034;14	England won by four wickets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;0	The worst floods in Vietnam 's rice growing area in three decades have killed 407 people , mostly children , according to figures reported in a newspaper Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;1	The floods in Vietnam 's Mekong River region also destroyed dlrs 208 million worth of crops and property , Tuoi Tre -LRB- Youth -RRB- reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;2	Officials at the government 's disaster management unit could not immediately confirm the newspaper 's figures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;3	The flood waters are receding from the eight stricken provinces but will probably not fully subside until next month , said Ingomar Anderson , an official of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;4	The floods , which began in June , were caused by heavy seasonal rains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;5	`` If you talk about water levels , the worst is over , '' Anderson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;6	`` But that does n't mean the worst is over for the people because they lost their crops . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;7	Members of the federation have donated dlrs 2 million of emergency aid , and half of the money has already been distributed to local authorities to buy boats , fishing nets and clothing , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;8	About 22,000 Vietnamese who fled their flooded homes will probably have to live for at least another month at temporary sites , Anderson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;9	Sicknesses such as diarrhea are widespread at the sites , he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;10	Among those most badly affected by the floods are recent ethnic Vietnamese immigrants from neighboring Cambodia who fled communal violence there last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0035;11	The Vietnamese government has paid the equivalent of dlrs 5.8 million in cash and supplies to the flood victims , Tuoi Tre reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0036;0	Japan has agreed with Russia to postpone payments of 100 million dollars , a part of the debts owed by the former Soviet Union to the Export-Import Bank of Japan that falls due on Dec. 31 , the government said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0036;1	A new deadline for repayment has been set for Sept. 30 , 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0036;2	Japan has signed another deferment agreement for 180 million dollars worth of debts with trade insurance , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0036;3	With this agreement , the total debts that Japan has postponed for Russia in 1994 comes to about 280 million dollars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;0	Vietnamese retail prices rose 13.2 percent during the first 11 months of the year , a report said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;1	Prices increased by 1.7 percent in November due partly to heavy floods in the Mekong River region , Vietnam 's biggest rice-growing area , the Saigon Newsreader reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;2	The floods caused temporary shortages and speculation that led to higher rice prices .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;3	Vietnam had hoped to keep inflation at less than 10 percent this year , but prices exceeded the target in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;4	Government officials have set a new goal of keeping inflation below 14 percent in 1994 , the newspaper reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;5	Official newspapers have tried to justify the higher-than-expected price increases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;6	They report , for example , that higher prices for rice mean better incomes for the four-fifths of the nation 's people who live by farming .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;7	International lenders such as the World Bank have praised Vietnam 's success in reigning in inflation , which reached 775 percent in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;8	Free-market reforms since then have encouraged farmers and businessmen to produce more food and consumer goods to meet domestic demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;9	Inflation stood at 5.2 percent in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0037;10	Vietnam 's National Assembly has targeted a maximum inflation rate of 10 percent next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;0	The Asian Development Bank announced Friday it has begun offering a new category of loans at prevailing market rates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;1	The Manila-based bank said the new fund source , its third lending `` window , '' was opened in response to growing demand for market-based loans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;2	The bank 's two other loan categories are a pool-based , multi-currency loan window which is predominantly in Japanese yen and a pool-based single-currency window in U.S. dollars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;3	Lending rates of the windows are based on the cost of pools of borrowing undertaken separately for each window plus a variable lending spread .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;4	The new loan window is linked to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;5	Borrowers from this window will have the option of having their loans priced at either fixed or floating rates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;6	The floating rate will be linked to the six-month LIBOR in each loan currency while the fixed lending rate will be set at the time of disbursement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0039;7	Loan maturities will range from eight to 15 years , the bank added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;0	The United States is about to resume an anti-drug intelligence operation with Colombia that the administration suspended seven months ago because of questions about its legality .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;1	An administration official said resumption of the program is imminent , adding that agreement with Peru is close as well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;2	A congressional study carried out during the summer said that suspension of the program had benefited drug traffickers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;3	Until last May , ground-based U.S. radar was able to keep tabs on drug flights out of the two Andean countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;4	Very few flights were intercepted but authorities in Bogota and Lima were able to use the data to stage raids on cocaine laboratories and storage facilities , officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;5	The United States discontinued the program in May on grounds that U.S. officials could be held liable under international law if Colombia or Peru used the U.S.-supplied data to shoot down civilian aircraft suspected of being used in drug trafficking .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;6	American sensitivities about the downing of innocent aircraft were heightened in April when U.S. F-15 fighters , in a case of mistaken identity , shot down two American helicopters in northern Iraq .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;7	Twenty-six people were killed : 15 Americans , five Kurds , three Turks , two Britons and a Frenchman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;8	Just two weeks later , nervous administration officials called a halt to the radar operations in Peru and Colombia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;9	Civilian aircraft is the most common means to send cocaine base from Peru to Colombia for final processing and for ultimate distribution in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;10	The May decision prompted expressions of outrage from officials in Colombia and Peru , who felt it demonstrated a lack of U.S. resolve .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;11	It also produced a deep rift between the counter-narcotics offices in the Pentagon and the State Department , which vigorously opposed the suspension .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;12	Legislation approved by Congress at the administration 's request this past summer requires the administration to certify that the country receiving the intelligence data has taken measures to protect against innocent loss of life .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;13	An administration official , asking not to be identified , said details of the new arrangement have been completed with Colombia and `` we 're almost there with Peru . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;14	The study carried out during the summer by the General Accounting Office , a congressional agency , said the May decision made life easier for the drug traffickers in several ways .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;15	It said they were able to use multiple flights with smaller drug loads than before .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;16	They also began flying during daylight hours instead of the early evening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0040;17	In addition , they were able to spend more time on the ground and used more direct air routes instead of the more circuitous ones used previously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;0	A regional pro-democracy forum adopted a resolution Friday demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners held by Burma 's military junta .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;1	Mrs. Suu Kyi , leader of the pro-democracy opposition to Burma 's military government , has been under house arrest since July 1989 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;2	She won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prise for her struggle .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;3	The resolution -- adopted by about 200 former heads of state , politicians and scholars from around the world -- called on the Burmese ruling council to unconditionally release Mrs. Suu Kyi and other political prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;4	The participants in the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia Pacific also pledged to join international efforts to implement United Nations resolutions aimed at restoring democracy in Burma .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;5	The forum says one of its main goals is to fight authoritarian rulers in the Asia-Pacific region who say democracy is a luxury with less priority than economic development .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;6	`` The true development of human beings involves much more than mere economic growth , '' Mrs. Suu Kyi said in a message read by former Philippine President Corazon Aquino to the forum .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;7	`` Mere material assistance is not enough ; the poor must have the sense that they themselves can shape their own future ... in a world where political leadership is often synonymous with tyranny and the rule of a narrow elite . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;8	Although the National League for Democracy , led by Mrs. Suu Kyi , won a landslide victory in 1990 elections , the military junta has so far refused to yield power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;9	In March , the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution urging the government in Rangoon to improve human rights conditions and immediately release Mrs. Suu Kyi , who is in her sixth year under house arrest without trial .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;10	`` She is healthy , high-spirited and well-informed , '' said Sein Win , prime minister of Burma 's exile government , the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;11	He was attending the forum .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;12	`` On the whole , there has been no real change in Burma .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;13	The human rights situation remains the same , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;14	The forum drew many human rights advocates , such as former President Oscar Sanchez Arias of Costa Rica and Ed Broadbent , head of the Montreal-based International Center for Human Rights and Democratic Development .
APW_ENG_19941202.0042;15	The forum -- co-hosted by Mrs. Aquino and Kim Dae-jung , an eight-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee for his struggle against South Korea 's past authoritarian governments -- ends Saturday after a three-day inaugural conference in Seoul .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;0	A rocket scientist in India 's space program has been arrested on suspicion of passing on secrets , newspapers reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;1	Nambi Narayanan was the second space expert to be accused in a spy ring case after the Oct. 20 arrest of a woman who allegedly seduced scientists and blackmailed them to give her designs of rocket engines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;2	Indian newspapers quoted unidentifed police sources as saying the ring was working for Pakistan , India 's neighbor and arch-enemy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;3	Narayanan , who helped develop engines for India 's satellite launch vehicles and defense missiles , was arrested Wednesday in Trivandrum on India 's southern coast , reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;4	He was the head of the liquid propulsion laboratory of the Indian Space Research Organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;5	Reports said Indian police began an espionage probe after arresting Mariam Rasheda , a citizen of an Indian Ocean archipelago , the Maldives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;6	Rasehda 's interrogation led to the arrests of a rocket expert and K. Chandrashekaran , a businessman who claimed to represent the Russian space company Glavkosmos , the Indian Express newspaper said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;7	At least 30 other scientists , businessmen and a top police officer are involved in the affair , reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;8	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;9	Both are believed capable of producing nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;10	India is developing its own weapons delivery system , while Pakistan buys M-11 missiles from China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;11	Indian scientists have worked on rockets to launch communications satellites since 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;12	But the space laboratories also are involved in developing missile technology .
APW_ENG_19941202.0043;13	Under U.S. pressure , Glavkosmos was forced to cancel a deal to supply rocket engines to India in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0044;0	An unbeaten century by Sachin Tendulkar helped India pile up 365 for four at lunch on the second day of the second cricket test against West India in Nagpur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0044;1	With Tendulkar not out on 148 , his eighth test century , India consolidated their grip on the match after resuming at an overnight score of 230 for four without losing any wicket .
APW_ENG_19941202.0044;2	Skipper Mohammed Azharuddin was batting on 58 , scored off 71 balls and including seven boundaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0044;3	India is 1-0 up in the three test series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;0	Now that Japan has issued an apology , of sorts , about its attack on Pearl Harbor , some historians say the United States should be declaring its own regrets about its conduct after that fateful day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;1	They say the two U.S. military leaders blamed for having their guard down when Japanese planes destroyed much of the Pacific Fleet were scapegoats whose names should be cleared .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;2	Rear Adm. Husband E. Kimmel and Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short have been regarded for more than 50 years as sleeping sentries , said British author John Costello .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;3	`` But the record shows that they were really more like two guards who have been blindfolded by the lack of intelligence , told to face the wrong direction , and inadequately armed to fend off an enemy air attack . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;4	Costello and two other like-minded historians spoke at the National Archives on Thursday , trying to attract a measure of the public interest aroused by Japan 's debates over its wartime behavior .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;5	Japan apologized Nov. 21 , not for attacking Pearl Harbor , but for failing to warn that it was at war with the United States before attacking .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;6	The surprise attack on Dec. 7 , 1941 , killed 2,403 people , sank or damaged 18 warships , destroyed 188 planes and drew the United States into World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;7	U.S. officials refused as recently as last year to reopen the case of Kimmel and Short , both cited during the war for dereliction of duty and both now dead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;8	The Kimmel family , 32 retired admirals and two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are among those who have pressed for the commanders ' vindication .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;9	Kimmel , who was commander of the Pacific Fleet , and Short , commander of the Army 's Hawaii department , were blamed in official inquiries for playing down intelligence reports warning of Japan 's intentions and for mounting inadequate reconnaissance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;10	Costello said his new book , `` Days of Infamy , '' builds on previously reported evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not given the full benefit of American intelligence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;11	The commanders indeed shrugged off some 11th-hour signals of trouble , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;12	But they did so because a steady drumbeat of intelligence from Washington had pointed to the Philippines as the likely target for Japan 's move against U.S. forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;13	Nine hours after Pearl Harbor , Japan bombed Clark Field in the Philippines , destroying 18 bombers , 55 fighters and 33 other planes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0045;14	In the Philippines , Costello said , Gen. Douglas MacArthur had received `` the full diplomatic picture of Japan 's march toward belligerence '' but did nothing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;0	An independent counsel concluded his investigation of the search of President Clinton 's passport files during the 1992 presidential campaign , saying no criminal charges will be filed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;1	Joseph diGenova , who has been investigating the matter for nearly two years , said his report will exonerate the former Bush administration officials who had been the subject of his probe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;2	`` No question about it , '' he said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;3	A three-judge federal panel appointed diGenova nearly two years ago , after President Bush 's attorney general , William Barr , found possible evidence of criminal intent in the search of the Democratic presidential candidate 's passport files .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;4	Late in the campaign , rumors had surfaced that while Clinton was a student in England , he had sought information on how to renounce his U.S. citizenship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;5	The unfounded rumors triggered requests for government documents from the news media and an inquiry from a Republican House member , Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;6	Political appointees at the State Department expedited the search , and State Department Inspector General Sherman Funk concluded after his own investigation that they had sought to use their official access to government records to damage Clinton 's chances against Bush .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;7	Among those criticized in Funk 's report was Elizabeth Tamposi , the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs , who was subsequently fired .
APW_ENG_19941202.0047;8	Funk referred the matter to the Justice Department for prosecution , and Barr then sought appointment of an independent counsel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;0	Japan , the only country that has suffered atomic attacks , expressed displeasure for a second day Friday over a U.S. plan to issue a postal stamp showing a nuclear mushroom cloud .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;1	`` I do n't think the Japanese people will have good feelings toward the design of the stamp , '' Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;2	`` We may convey our feelings to the U.S. side in some form , '' he told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;3	The U.S. Postal Service plans to begin selling the stamp next September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;4	The stamp depicts the explosion of the atomic bomb dropped by U.S. forces on the city of Hiroshima in the closing days of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;5	Under the mushroom cloud , it says , `` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;6	Within five months after the bombing of Hiroshima , about 140,000 of the city 's 340,000 residents died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;7	Another atomic bombing of Nagasaki three days later killed 70,000 of that city 's 270,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;8	Several days later , on Aug. 15 , 1945 , Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;9	Survivors of the atomic bombing and anti-nuclear activists expressed anger over the stamp on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;10	Sunao Tsuboi , a leader of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-Bomb Survivors ' Organizations , called the stamp `` outrageous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0048;11	`` It makes our blood boil with anger , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;0	A 13-year-old Japanese boy hanged himself in his back yard after being bullied by classmates into giving them more than 1 million yen -LRB- dlrs 10,000 -RRB- over three years , reports said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;1	In a four-page suicide note , Kiyoteru Okouchi said a group of four classmates at Tobu Junior High School had been abusing him and extorting money from him for three years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;2	His body was found Sunday night hanging from a tree at his home in Nishio , about 270 kilometers -LRB- 170 miles -RRB- west of Tokyo , local police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;3	Police would not say how much money Okouchi handed over after the other students repeatedly hit him and dunked his head in a river , but news reports said the total came to 1.1 million yen -LRB- dlrs 11,000 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;4	He took the money from his parents ' house without permission and left a note addressed to his mother acknowledging the debt , Kyodo News Service said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;5	Bullying remains frequent at Japan 's regimented schools .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;6	Typical targets are children with outstanding grades , physical handicaps , foreign upbringing , or who otherwise do n't conform .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;7	Some students choose suicide rather than continue to face bullying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;8	Last year , 113 students between the ages of 10 and 19 committed suicide for school-related problems such as bullying and severe punishments from teachers , according to a National Police Agency report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;9	About the same amount was reported in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;10	A total of 23,258 cases of bullying were reported in public schools in 1992 , up from 22,062 cases reported in 1991 , according to the most recent figures available from the Education Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;11	`` For him , suicide was no doubt the most severe form of retaliation possible , '' said Susumu Abe , a noted critic on educational issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;12	`` Japanese children are not given enough instruction about the constraints they should put on their actions toward others . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0049;13	In Japan , children under age of 16 do not face criminal prosecution and are tried only in family courts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0050;0	Top Islamic fundamentalist Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar and PLO chief Yasser Arafat formed a committee Friday to work out differences and prevent violence , said Arafat aide Ahmed Tibi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0050;1	`` It was a warm and fruitful meeting between myself and my brother and what we have agreed on is good for both sides , '' Zahar told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0050;2	The early morning meeting was the first since a bloody confrontation between Arafat 's police and Islamic activists on Nov. 18 that left 14 dead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0050;3	The agreement to establish a committee ended a tense period of uncertainty in the Gaza Strip where many feared a possible civil war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0050;4	Tibi said the nine-member committee , that includes Hamas and PLO officials as well as two Israeli Arabs , would meet soon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;0	The worst floods in Vietnam 's main rice growing area in three decades have killed 407 people , mostly children , according to figures reported in a newspaper Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;1	The floods in Vietnam 's Mekong River region also destroyed dlrs 208 million worth of crops and property , Tuoi Tre -LRB- Youth -RRB- reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;2	Officials at the government 's disaster management unit could not immediately confirm the newspaper 's figures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;3	The flood waters are receding from the eight stricken provinces but will probably not fully subside until next month , said Ingomar Anderson , an official of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;4	The floods , which began in June , were caused by heavy seasonal rains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;5	`` If you talk about water levels , the worst is over , '' Anderson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;6	`` But that does n't mean the worst is over for the people because they lost their crops . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;7	Members of the federation have donated dlrs 2 million of emergency aid , and half of the money has already been distributed to local authorities to buy boats , fishing nets and clothing , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;8	About 22,000 Vietnamese who fled their flooded homes will probably have to live for at least another month at temporary sites , Anderson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;9	Sicknesses such as diarrhea are widespread at the sites , he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;10	Among those most badly affected by the floods are recent ethnic Vietnamese immigrants from neighboring Cambodia who fled communal violence there last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0051;11	The Vietnamese government has paid the equivalent of dlrs 5.8 million in cash and supplies to the flood victims , Tuoi Tre reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;0	Eating cheese sandwiches and sleeping across from duty-free shops selling perfume , Khadija Abdul-Aziz has spent nine months in the Cairo airport transit lounge -- bound for nowhere .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;1	The tall , 34-year-old woman with close-cropped hair says she is a refugee from Angola , but has no passport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;2	Officials have doubts about her claim .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;3	The United Nations and five countries are trying to figure out just who she is .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;4	While she waits , this woman without a country spends her days sitting in the transit lounge , talking to Egyptian airport workers and watching other potential refugees come and go .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;5	`` I am devastated in every way and I am living in this whirlpool , '' she said during an interview in an airport hallway , its walls painted a sickly yellow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;6	`` Every day is the same here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;7	Abdul-Aziz says she fled to Portugal in 1985 , escaping a massacre in Angola that killed her parents , brother and husband .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;8	Her three children were with her , and she was pregnant with a fourth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;9	Her two girls and two boys are now in Italy with a sister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;10	After working in Spain for seven years , she says , she was deported for having an expired visa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;11	Sudan was her destination because -- she says -- she was keeping a Sudanese friend 's passport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;12	In Khartoum , the passport was confiscated and she was put on the first flight to Egypt , which sent her to Spain , which sent her back to Cairo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;13	She 's been at Cairo airport since March .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;14	`` My children do n't know I am in here .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;15	I tell them I am still working in Spain and that everything is fine , '' she told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;16	It 's a sad story -- if it 's true .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;17	Officials wonder about that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;18	She is a Muslim -- a religion almost unknown among Angolans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;19	She speaks excellent Arabic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;20	She said she learned it from an airport guard , but her dialect is Sudanese .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;21	The U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees is trying to help her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;22	The Egyptian government would like her to leave , but she has refused to see Angolan diplomats to help verify her identity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;23	`` The Egyptian immigration office said she does not speak any local Angolan dialects but is fluent in Arabic , '' said Cesar Felizardo , first secretary of Angola 's Embassy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;24	So Abdul-Aziz stays in the transit area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;25	About a dozen other people sit in the area , sometimes for a few days , while their status is investigated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;26	Abdul-Aziz has the only bed in a room reserved for women .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;27	One day earlier this week , bundles of clothing were heaped on the floor , and two figures slept on the stained brown carpet under an old gray blanket .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;28	`` I had to buy new blankets because it is too cold , '' Abdul-Aziz said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;29	The UNHCR has given her 900 Egyptian pounds , or about dlrs 270 , over the past nine months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;30	`` We first heard about Abdul-Aziz 's case in June ... and we gave her money on humanitarian grounds , '' said UNHCR spokesman Panos Moumtzis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;31	He said the UNHCR is also confused about her identity , noting she once said she was Sudanese .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;32	She has applied for help from a United States program for women , `` Women at Risk , '' but has had no answer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;33	Egypt also says it wants to help .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;34	`` It is not Egypt 's fault that she is staying at the airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;35	... We want somebody to tell us who she is so that we can send her out , '' said Hazem Taher of the Foreign Ministry 's Refugee Department .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;36	But Abdul-Aziz stays on , complaining the airport supplies only one cheese sandwich a day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;37	`` If I lived on only that I would have been buried a long time ago , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;38	Asked of her hopes , Abdul-Aziz said she wants to leave -- but not to Angola -- and to see her children .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;39	`` I do n't mind going anywhere , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0052;40	`` I am very tired from inside . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0054;0	Authorities have arrested 51 people for killing 16 Asian elephants to obtain their ivory tusks , a blow to the preservation of the endangered animals , an official report said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;1	The elephants were killed in a 240,000-hectare -LRB- 592,800-acre -RRB- nature preserve in southwest China 's Yunnan province , the Guangming Daily reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;2	Asian elephants are native to the sub-tropical southern Yunnan region of Xishuangbanna , but only about 200 still exist nationwide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;3	Forestry officials said the case was the largest slaughter of protected animals in recent years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;4	The report said forestry police and reserve managers began receiving reports in March of hunters with military-style rifles going into the nature preserve .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;5	A three-month investigation revealed that the gang had killed 16 Asian elephants and injured four others since mid-1993 , it said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0054;8	The tusks were smuggled out of the country , the report said , without saying where .
APW_ENG_19941202.0054;9	Ivory trade has been banned worldwide in an effort to protect the dwindling numbers of elephants around the world .

APW_ENG_19941202.0058;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;1	The allies opened daylong talks with counterparts from nearly two-dozen nations in Eastern Europe in a session likely to be dominated by Russia 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the alliance in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;3	He also backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;4	`` I think that we 'll all get -LRB- it -RRB- sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he entered alliance headquarters for the second day of discussions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;5	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;6	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;7	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;8	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;9	`` It 's our problem and the alliance 's problem -- not the Russians ' , '' said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;10	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;11	In an effort to meet their demands , but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;12	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;13	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;14	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;15	In an effort to overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , the NATO allies had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;16	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;17	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;18	Afterward , Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said Kozyrev `` threw a bucket of cold water on the meeting . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;19	Kozyrev refused to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow intended to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;20	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;21	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said in impromptu remarks that were broadcast to reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;22	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;23	U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning that he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;24	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;25	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , tried to reassure Kozyrev that NATO was n't shifting direction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;26	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;27	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian minister just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;28	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;29	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;30	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;31	In an effort to heal the wounds , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0058;32	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;0	Ernesto Zedillo 's grade school teacher always told her students that one among them might just grow up to be president .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;1	With her former student 's inauguration as Mexico 's newest president on Thursday , Celia Ladron de Guevara no longer has to hedge with words like `` might . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;2	Ladron said she always encouraged her students to aspire to greatness -- telling them they could reach the county 's top office if they worked hard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;3	`` Some of my students would laugh , thinking it was a joke , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;4	`` Today they 're no longer laughing . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;5	Ladron remembered Zedillo as a poor , skinny boy who always came to class clean and neatly dressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;6	`` And he was always first in his class , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;7	Zedillo learned the value of hard work early , growing up in a poor family in this city near the U.S. border , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;8	`` To make it , he had odd jobs outside of school , shining shoes , selling newspapers . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;9	Zedillo 's grades enabled him to study in some of Mexicali 's better schools , where many students come from much wealthier families .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;10	`` Fortunately , all of the students wore uniforms , so it was n't too obvious who came from rich and poor families , '' Ladron said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;11	Even Carlos Ling Altamirano , who heads the local chapter of the National Action Party , Mexico 's leading opposition party , is proud of the hometown boy 's achievements .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;12	`` Historically , many of Mexico 's presidents have come from the north , because life here is harder , '' Ling said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0059;13	`` There are deserts here and people have to work harder to survive . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;0	A ferry carrying more than 600 people collided with a Singapore-registered freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 17 people , the Coast Guard reported .

APW_ENG_19941202.0060;3	There was no immediate official report on the cause of the accident , but the company which owned the Cebu City said it had been rammed by the Singapore-registered freighter Kota Suria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;4	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the Kota Suria 's bow crashed into the Cebu City , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;5	He said ship captain Wesceslao Lampong and several other officers were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;6	Erwin Maravilla , one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol , said his family was sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;7	`` Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;8	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;9	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;10	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;11	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0060;13	President Fidel Ramos ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;14	Maximo Calamba , 38 , who survived with his wife Veneranda , 30 , and 1-year-old son Marcelo , complained that the ferry crew failed to inform them about the approaching freighter and did not help people evacuate the ship after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;15	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;16	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own , '' Calamba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;17	`` When we were rescued by the Suria I could still hear crying out for help . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;18	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;19	At least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were trying to recover survivors , it said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;20	The Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers , but only 605 people were on board at the time of the accident , said a spokesman for the Williams Lines shipping company .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;21	The Cebu City sank near the mouth of Manila Bay near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;22	It had left the port of Manila bound for Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;23	Quirimon Tan , William Lines vice president , said each of the dead passengers was covered by 50,000 pesos -LRB- dlrs 2,173 -RRB- in insurance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0060;24	He said the company would also pay for medical and funeral expenses .

APW_ENG_19941202.0067;0	NATO foreign ministers sought today to reassure Russia that the alliance 's plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new divide in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;1	The allies opened daylong talks with their counterparts from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics in a session likely to be dominated by Russia 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the alliance in coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;3	He also announced Russia 's withdrawal from a program to improve military and political cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;4	`` I think that we 'll all get -LRB- it -RRB- sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he entered alliance headquarters for the second day of discussions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;5	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;6	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;7	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;8	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;9	`` It 's our problem and the alliance 's problem -- not the Russians ' , '' said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;10	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;11	In an effort to meet their demands , but without upsetting Russia , the allies thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;12	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;13	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;14	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms , costs and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;15	In an effort to ease Russian fears about its eastward expansion , the NATO allies had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;16	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;17	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;18	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;19	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said in impromptu remarks broadcast to reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;20	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;21	U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning that he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;22	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;23	Willy Claes , the alliance 's new secretary-general , tried to reassure Kozyrev that NATO was n't shifting direction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;24	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;25	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian minister just before he left NATO headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;26	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;27	Kozyrev 's outburst only added to the alliance 's woes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;28	There have been unprecedented strains in recent weeks between the United States and its European allies over Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;29	In an effort to heal the wounds , Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0067;30	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure from the Europeans , led by Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;0	U.S. intelligence in the late 1950s foresaw that the Soviets would make long-range missiles a focus of their nuclear arms buildup but greatly underestimated the surge once it began , newly declassified records show .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;1	The records , released Friday by the CIA at a Harvard University conference , paint a picture of American intelligence analysts in the early Cold War years struggling to understand Soviet military intentions with little hard information .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;2	The reports , prepared jointly by the CIA and the other main U.S. spy agencies , contain what the CIA called the most sensitive intelligence information ever made public .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;3	Although the CIA and the other U.S. spy agencies failed to recognize fully the 1960s buildup of Soviet missiles capable of striking U.S. soil , they did believe that whatever the size of the Soviet nuclear arsenal , it was not designed for deliberate attack on America .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;4	In fact the analysts generally ascribed much the same motives for the Soviet nuclear buildup as U.S. officials used to justify America 's : to deter the other side from starting a war and to be able to retaliate and survive if deterrence failed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;5	This can be seen in many of the 80 formerly top-secret National Intelligence Estimates declassified and made public Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;6	The reports cover the years 1954 through 1983 and were declassified as part of a project started in 1992 to release all Cold War-era intelligence assessments that are at least 10 years old .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;7	The question of Soviet capabilities to launch a nuclear attack on America overshadowed all other issues facing U.S. intelligence for many years after World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;8	The United States , which exploded the world 's first nuclear bomb in 1945 , had a monopoly on nuclear power until the Soviets successfully tested their first bomb in 1949 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;9	From that point the nuclear arms race was on .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;10	In early 1957 , intelligence forecasts put little stock in the threat of a buildup of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles , or ICBMs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;11	Long-range bombers were seen as the main threat in the 1950s and 1960s , although the newly released records show U.S. intelligence greatly overestimated the bomber buildup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;12	A special top-secret report on Sept. 18 , 1957 , informed President Eisenhower and his national security advisers that the Soviets probably had conducted their first flight tests of ICBMs , the first on Aug. 21 and the second on Sept. 7 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;13	In a follow-up special report to the president on Dec. 10 , the intelligence agencies said they had concluded that ICBM development was `` an extremely high priority in the USSR '' and may already be a rush building program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;14	As late as 1963 , U.S. intelligence reported it was `` still unable to identify positively any ICBM launching facilities '' other than those at the Tyuratam test range .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;15	In fact the first Soviet ICBMs became operational in 1960 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;16	By 1965 , evidence indicated the Soviets had 224 ICBMs with launch units , but the intelligence reports indicated confusion and disagreement about the scope and pace of the missile production efforts in the USSR .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;17	A year later , in 1966 , U.S. intelligence began doubting its earlier projections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;18	In 1967 , the U.S. forecasts of future Soviet ICBM deployments were adjusted upward and it was predicted that by 1968 the Soviets would have as many of the long-range missiles as the United State would have -- about 1,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;19	As it turned out , the Soviet ICBM force peaked in the 1970s at about 1,400 missiles ; it now is about half that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;20	The U.S. force peaked at 1,000 and is now about 500 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0068;21	The United States always held an edge in sea-based and air-delivered nuclear arms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;0	A ferry carrying more than 600 people collided with a Singapore-registered freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 34 people , the Coast Guard reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;1	Coast Guard spokesman Amado Samante said 449 passengers had been rescued and the search was continuing for others .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;2	The bodies of 34 people who had drowned were recovered , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;3	The 2,452-ton ferry , the Cebu City , sank 30 minutes after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;4	There was no immediate official report on the cause of the accident , but the company which owned the Cebu City said it had been rammed by the Singapore-registered freighter Kota Suria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;5	Eugene Espedino , vice president of the company , said it was preparing a request for the coast guard to detain the freighter and its crew .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;6	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the Kota Suria 's bow crashed into the Cebu City , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;7	He said ship captain Wesceslao Lampong and several other officers were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;8	Erwin Maravilla , one of the first group of survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol , said his family was sleeping at the time of the accident .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;9	`` Suddenly we heard a crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;10	I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;11	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids , '' he said , adding that his wife was also missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;12	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;13	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;14	The 12,500-ton Kota Suria , with a crew of 26 , was damaged in its bow but joined the rescue effort , carrying 230 of those saved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;15	President Fidel Ramos ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;16	Maximo Calamba , 38 , who survived with his wife Veneranda , 30 , and 1-year-old son Marcelo , complained that the ferry crew failed to inform them about the approaching freighter and did not help people evacuate the ship after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;17	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;18	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own , '' Calamba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;19	`` When we were rescued by the Suria I could still hear crying out for help . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;20	Cargo containers and rubber rafts were floating at the scene , but it was unclear whether there were people aboard , said radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;21	At least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were trying to recover survivors , it said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;22	The Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers , but only 605 people were on board at the time of the accident , said a spokesman for the Williams Lines shipping company .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;23	The Cebu City sank near the mouth of Manila Bay near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;24	It had left the port of Manila bound for Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;25	Quirimon Tan , William Lines vice president , said each of the dead passengers was covered by 50,000 pesos -LRB- dlrs 2,173 -RRB- in insurance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;26	He said the company would also pay for medical and funeral expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0069;27	The Philippines ' worst peacetime ferry disaster was in December 1987 , when 3,537 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;0	Floris Jan Bovelander scored twice from first-half penalty corners to guide defending champion Netherlands to a 3-1 victory over Australia Friday and a place in the final of the World Cup field hockey tournament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;1	The Dutch will face Pakistan in Sunday 's championship game -- a repeat of the 1990 final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;2	Pakistan defeated Olympic champion Germany 5-3 in a penalty stroke shootout after the teams had drawn 1-1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;3	Bovelander fired the ball home in the fifth and 20th minutes and Jacques Brinkman added a stylish third goal with 3:50 remaining .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;4	Top seed Australia got its only goal from 19-year-old substitute Paul Gaudoin following a cleverly worked penalty corner 12 minutes into the second half .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;5	It was Gaudoin 's first international goal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;6	Kamran Ashraf scored from close range to put Pakistan ahead after 18 minutes in the second semifinal , but Sven Meinhardt equalized three minutes later from a penalty corner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;7	Pakistan converted all five of its penalty strokes , while goalkeeper Mansoor Ahmed made a dramatic diving save to stop Germany 's third stroke -- from captain Christian Blunck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;8	Mansoor also saved a penalty stroke from Blunck in the Champions Trophy final in Lahore in March , a game Pakistan won 7-6 on penalties after a 2-2 draw .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;9	`` That time I dived to my right , '' Mansoor said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;10	`` This time I just made up my mind and decided to dive left . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;11	Bovelander took his tally for the tournament to five goals and also had a third penalty corner strike controversially disallowed in the second half against Australia after it was ruled the ball had not struck the backboard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;12	The Dutch , who advanced through the preliminary round undefeated , dominated the semifinal for long periods and did not allow the Australian forwards room in which to be creative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;13	Erik Jazet was outstanding in defense , while captain Marc Delissen was a dynamo in midfield .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;14	The Dutch now are unbeaten in their last 27 internationals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;15	They sealed their victory with a brilliant flowing attack .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;16	Teun de Nooijer and Taco van den Honert set up Brinkman with some slick stickwork and the inside forward finished the move with an emphatic shot .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;17	`` We have a young team and a lot of people in Holland might be surprised we have made the final , '' said Delissen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;18	`` We 've proved we are a good side . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;19	Coach Roelant Oltmans , who led the Dutch women to a World Cup victory in Australia four years ago , said he was looking forward to a rematch with Pakistan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;20	`` It will be special because it is the same final as four years ago , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;21	Australian captain Warren Birmingham said his team was devastated by the loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;22	`` Playing in a World Cup at home we had very high expectations , so it is natural that we are very disappointed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;23	Pakistan was lifted against Germany by captain Shahbaz Ahmed , who played despite being troubled by a hamstring injury .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;24	`` Shahbaz is not 100 percent fit , but it was important to the morale of the team that he played , '' said team manager Abdul Rashid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;25	German coach Paul Lissek felt his team was unlucky .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;26	`` The chances were there but we did not take them , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;27	`` We played our best match of the tournament today -- and lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;28	The worst miss came two minutes from the end of the game when Andreas Becker was off target with the goal at his mercy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;29	England and India won consolation play-off games earlier Friday that assured them of top six finishes and places in the 1988 World Cup in the Netherlands and next year 's Champions Trophy tournament in Berlin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;30	India squandered a 2-0 first-half lead and was held to a 2-2 draw by Argentina before winning 4-1 on penalty strokes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;31	Goalkeeper Anjaparavanda Subbiah was the hero for India , making reflex saves to stop shots from Fernando Falchetti and Fernando Moresi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;32	He was chaired from the field by his delighted teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;33	`` It is immaterial to us who finishes fifth or sixth , '' said Indian coach Cedric D'Souza .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;34	`` What was important was that we finished in the top six .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;35	This was the most important match for us . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;36	Dhanraj Pillay and captain Jude Felix scored the goals for India , while Ferrara and Carlos Retegui replied for Argentina from penalty corners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;37	Penalty corner conversions by Rob Crutchley in the 13th and 20th minutes gave England a 2-0 halftime lead against South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;38	Jeon Jong-ha replied with a neat penalty corner variation six minutes after the break , but Russell Garcia converted a penalty stroke eight minutes from fulltime to seal the 3-1 triumph .
APW_ENG_19941202.0070;39	Consolation play-offs are scheduled Saturday with the final and bronze medal game to be played Sunday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;0	The top UN envoy in Bosnia planned to hold talks today with the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs on releasing more than 400 United Nations troops , including 55 Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;1	UN envoy Yasushi Akashi left Sarajevo this morning to meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , a Bosnian Serb stronghold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;2	In Sarajevo , Reuters news agency quoted UN officials as saying they believed Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;3	Sir Michael Rose , the UN commander in Bosnia , had won pledges in talks with Serb leaders in Pale to release the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;4	The report could not be confirmed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;5	One UN spokesman played down the report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;6	`` Tell us something new , '' said Alexander Ivanko , a UN press officer in Zagreb , Croatia , when asked about the report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;7	`` This is not the first time we 've had such assurances from the Serbs and nothing has happened . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;8	Maj. Rita LePage , a Canadian military spokeswoman in Zagreb , said this morning that the Canadians continued to be detained at various locations north of Sarajevo and there were no new developments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;9	Tensions at the Canadian peacekeepers ' camp in Visoko , near Sarajevo , eased today after a Serb threat to shell the camp was not carried out Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;10	The camp remained at the high alert level of orange , which requires personnel to wear flak jackets and helmets when outside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;11	But about 100 clerks and other non-essential personnel returned to the camp from nearby Kiseljak .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;12	They had slept in Kiseljak for the past four nights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;13	On Thursday , LePage said the Serbs ' top commander , Gen. Ratko Mladic , had reponded in letter to a UN protest over the detained peacekeepers and an attack last Sunday on the Canadian peacekeepers ' camp in Visoko , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;14	His reponse went to Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;15	Bertrand Guillaume de Lapresle , UN commander in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;16	Officials declined to comment Thursday on the contents of Mladic 's letter , saying they came at a `` sensitive '' time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;17	But sources said the response was n't specific enough for UN leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;18	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , in Paris on Thursday for a world conference on AIDS , said the troops ' detention is unacceptable but little progress has been made in efforts to win their release .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;19	`` They are detained , you can call it hostages .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;20	... But I would not fight on the meaning of words here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;21	Earlier , in a speech to the French Senate , Chretien said NATO allies will try to solve the crisis in talks in Budapest next week with former Soviet bloc countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0071;22	Optimism was dampened when Bosnian Serb forces crossed into Croatia on Tuesday , kidnapped seven Ukrainian peacekeepers and took them to Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;0	What if you were a nation that , after decades of not collecting income and other kinds of taxes , decided to start taxing your citizens and businesses again ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;1	And let 's say your new tax system was frequently criticized , generally disliked by the public , plagued by protesters and still struggling two years after adopting a controversial new tax policy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;2	Where to go for help ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;3	Maybe a country with two solid centuries of experience in the fine art of collecting taxes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;4	One that hauls in more than a trillion dollars a year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;5	Internal Revenue Service Ogden Service Center , meet State Tax Service , headquarters Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;6	A delegation of three high-ranking Russian finance and taxation officials toured the Ogden IRS center Wednesday for a closer look at America 's sophisticated , automated and oft-excoriated system of income tax collection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;7	Rolling through the center more swiftly than a 1040 Short Form , the delegation observed the flow of work and walked through small canyons of computer hardware merrily going about the business of transferring personal income to federal government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;8	It was an impressive sight , said Vladilen Vorontsov , head of the Russian Federation State Tax Service 's accounting , reporting and analysis department .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;9	`` Russia is undergoing dramatic changes economically , politically and in terms of its new tax policy and administration , '' said Vorontsov , a slender bespectacled man in his late 50s with gray hair and a flawless pinstripe suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;10	The country is entering the third year of a new tax system adopted after the collapse of the Soviet Union 's communist economy , he explained .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;11	The conversion is difficult because of Russia 's present economic situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;12	He was accompanied by Alla Zubkova , deputy head of the Russian Federation 's budget department , and Maria Reoutova , head of the STS ' accounting , tax statistics and information division .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;13	The Russian officials were scheduled to wrap up their Ogden visit Thursday with sessions on statistical analysis and tours of the Freeport Center and the U.S. Postal Service building in downtown Ogden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;14	Vorontsov , who served as spokesman for the trio during an interview , said the delegation found the visit informative and helpful but added there is little chance the new Russian tax system will be modeled after its American counterpart .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;15	For one thing , he said , the Russian system is much simpler with only about a dozen taxes of any kind at the federal level .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;16	Instead , it draws the bulk of its revenues from corporate rather than individual income taxes , which provide only about 10 percent of the federation 's tax collections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;17	`` Like anyone else , Russians are unwilling to pay taxes , '' Vorontsov noted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;18	`` The negative attitude is very deep , and I think one of the reasons is our people have had very little tax education .
APW_ENG_19941202.0073;19	`` It will take us quite some time before our taxpayers understand each -LRB- tax -RRB- is a contribution to a civilized society , '' Vorontsov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;0	Among the revelations from the CIA 's newly declassified reports on Soviet nuclear forces : -- In 1963 , the U.S. government was worried that the Soviets might develop an `` orbital bombardment '' system -- one or more satellites with a nuclear bomb aboard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;1	The fear was that they would `` de-orbit '' the nuclear warhead and detonate it about 150,000 feet above Earth -- a burst that `` would cause severe damage to cities '' over a large part of the United States , `` primarily by means of fire . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;2	The analysts doubted that the Soviets would actually try this , but they cautioned that Moscow was technically able to do it `` at any time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;3	This concern remained at least until the late 1960s , according to the reports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;4	-- In 1979 , the intelligence agencies predicted the Soviets would suffer 120 million casualties , including 85 million deaths , in a U.S. nuclear retaliatory strike , assuming minimal warning in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;5	They foresaw 100 million casualties , including 60 million killed , if the Soviets had time to occupy urban bomb shelters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;6	If all shelters were occupied and the Soviets had time to fully evacuate other areas , casualties would number 40 million , including 15 million deaths .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;7	The report contained no comparable estimates of U.S. casualties .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;8	-- Six months after President Ronald Reagan made his March 1983 `` Star Wars '' speech starting a crash research effort on a global shield against Soviet nuclear missiles , U.S. intelligence agencies foresaw a possibly disastrous Soviet response .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;9	If the United States actually developed such a missile shield and the Soviets had none , a Sept. 12 , 1983 , report said , the Soviets might attack it militarily .
APW_ENG_19941202.0074;10	They might also clandestinely place nuclear or germ weapons in U.S. and allied cities and threaten to use them in the event of war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;0	Air raids continued Friday in Chechnya amid reports that volunteers from throughout the Caucasus were coming to the aid of the restive republic 's embattled president .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;1	The Interfax news agency said there were rocket attacks early Friday on an airfield and two towns east of Grozny , the Chechen capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;2	It gave no details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;3	On Thursday , a small airfield near Grozny was hit in an air raid and four people died in a missile attack at Katayama , about 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- from Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;4	Russian newspapers were full of reports that volunteers from neighboring republics in the volatile Caucasus Mountains were arriving in Chechnya to fend off a Russian invasion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;5	Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev declared his tiny , mostly Muslim republic 's independence from Russia in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;6	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels who are now trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;7	The rebels began an offensive last week backed by combat aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;8	Thousands of people have fled the fighting in Grozny , a city of 300,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;9	President Boris Yeltsin threatened earlier this week to send in troops unless both Dudayev and his opponents stopped fighting and freed their prisoners of war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;10	Neither side complied and Yeltsin softened his stance to an offer of amnesty to those who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;11	Russia says it offers the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;12	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;13	Media reports say there are substantial troop buildups in southern Russia near the Chechen border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;14	Meanwhile , a delegation from the Russian parliament was in Grozny trying to negotiate the release of 70 Russian captives Dudayev claims were fighting alongside the Chechen opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;15	`` The use of force in Chechnya is doomed to failure , '' Sergei Yushenkov , head of the delegation , said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;16	Dudayev says the prisoners are Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;17	He first threatened to execute them , but now says they will be tried in military courts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;18	Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said the prisoners are mercenaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;19	Although Chechens are at odds , they are united in their distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;20	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches Thursday while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;21	Elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;22	Russians are generally content to let the Chechens go their own way , according to a poll Thursday by the International Opinion Research Center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;23	The poll of 3,250 people said 74.2 percent believe Russia should recognize Chechnya 's independence , while 5.5 percent said it should n't and 20.3 said they could n't answer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0075;24	The margin of error was 1 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;1	The ministers opened daylong talks with counterparts from more than 20 East European nations , including Russia , in a session likely to be dominated by Moscow 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the Western alliance in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;3	He also backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;4	`` I think that we 'll all get -LRB- it -RRB- sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said before Friday 's talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;5	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;6	Kozyrev 's comments clouded NATO 's attempt to draw in its former Warsaw Pact enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;7	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to a domestic audience in Russia , where the government faces a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;8	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;9	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the defense guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;10	To deal with the demands without upsetting Russia , the allies last January backed a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , providing for closer ties without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;11	Russia is among 23 nations enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part in NATO military exercises and other activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;12	On Thursday , the allies went further by ordering aides to draft a study of the terms and conditions for expanding NATO eastward .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;13	Meanwhile , the allies granted Russia a special relationship and denied they were forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;14	But Kozyrev told grim-faced NATO ministers : `` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;15	He refused to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow intended to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;16	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said in impromptu remarks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;17	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;18	NATO secretary-general Willy Claes immediately tried to reassure Kozyrev that NATO was n't shifting direction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;19	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;20	... There is nothing new , '' he told the Russian minister Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;21	`` We are not willing to organize new divisions in Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;22	Kozyrev 's outburst added to the woes of an alliance long strained by U.S.-European disputes over dealing with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;23	In an effort to mend the rift , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0076;24	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure particularly from Britain and France .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;1	The allies opened daylong talks with counterparts from nearly two-dozen nations in Eastern Europe in a session likely to be dominated by Russia 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the alliance in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;3	He also backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;4	`` I think that we 'll all get -LRB- it -RRB- sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd before Friday 's talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;5	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;6	Willy Claes , the new secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;7	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;8	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;9	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;10	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;11	`` It 's our problem and the alliance 's problem -- not the Russians ' , '' said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;12	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;13	The Russian outburst pushed , at least temporarily , the crisis in Bosnia off the ministers ' agenda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;14	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher , Hurd and Kozyrev were meeting later in the day with Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe of France and Klaus Kinkel of Germany to try to revive the peace process in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;15	Christopher wants formal approval from the others for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;16	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;17	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;18	`` The essence of any peace plan is a very substantial Bosnian Serb withdrawal -LRB- and -RRB- continuance of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its own borders , '' Hurd told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;19	Juppe and Hurd plan to fly to Belgrade this weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;20	The NATO allies , in trying to meet East Europeans demands for membership without upsetting Russia , thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;21	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;22	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;23	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;24	To overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , NATO had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;25	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;26	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;27	Kozyrev refused to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow intended to ease Russia 's fears of an eastward drive by the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;28	He said he read the ministers ' statement on membership and immediately called Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;29	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;30	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;31	U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning that he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0077;32	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;0	In renewed fighting between left-wing guerrillas and the police in a southern Indian state , six rebels were killed in separate attacks on Friday , a news agency said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;1	The Peoples War Group , an organization fighting for poor farmers , has carried out a series of attacks to disrupt Thursday 's voting to elect a new legislature in Andhra Pradesh state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;2	During the final week of campaigning , about 30 people , mostly policemen , have been killed in land mine explosions blamed on the group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;3	Three rebels were killed when they tried to disrupt voting on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;4	On Friday , three rebels were killed in a gun battle with the police in Karimnagar province , while three others were killed in as many different encounters elsewhere in the state , United News of India said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;5	The area is about 1,500 kilometers -LRB- 930 miles -RRB- south of New Delhi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0079;6	The group has been leading a peasants ' rebellion against rich landowners and attacked the police in the state for several years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;0	Great Britain has canceled half the debt owed it by Vietnam while giving Hanoi more time to pay back the remaining amount , a British diplomat said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;1	Britain formally reduced Vietnam 's debt from dlrs 26 million to dlrs 13 million in an agreement signed in Hanoi Thursday , said Martin Garrett , second commercial secretary at the British embassy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;2	The debt consists of principal and interest arising from unpaid bills to British exporters dating as far back as the late 1970s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;3	The agreement was a de facto condition for a British aid package of dlrs 75 million in grants and soft loans , Garrett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;4	Britain will make the funds available as soon as Vietnam identifies the projects it wants to finance , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;5	Britain joins other European countries that have taken similar steps to ease Vietnam 's debt burden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;6	France agreed in July to cancel dlrs 229 million in Vietnamese debt , while Germany wrote off dlrs 101 million in old loans in August .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;7	Britain agreed in principle to cancel half its Vietnamese debt at a meeting of creditor nations in November 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;8	It played a leading role then in persuading other countries to do the same , Garrett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;9	The diplomat gave no details about the new repayment terms for the remaining loans , except to say that Vietnam would have several years to pay them back .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;10	Western countries such as Britain are eager to help Vietnam as it replaces socialist central planning with a free market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0080;11	Vietnam 's 72 million people and its average economic growth rate of 7.3 percent during each of the past three years make it an increasingly attractive economic market for them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;0	Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada on Friday proposed a broad free-trade agreement between the world 's two largest trading blocs , Western Europe and North America .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;1	In a speech to French businessmen , Chretien welcomed the growth of regional trading blocs , such as the European Union and the U.S.-Canada-Mexico alliance forged by the North American Free-Trade Agreement -LRB- NAFTA -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;2	`` Yet this also entails its share of risk , and I am particularly sensitive to defensive and protectionist attitudes that might lead the major regional blocs to withdraw timidly into their own shells , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;3	`` We must overcome the trade disputes that weigh down our relations and create unnecessary fears , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;4	`` We should look carefully at the idea of a global trade liberalization agreement between NAFTA and the European Union . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;5	He said Canada , which sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States , had experienced a stagnation of its trade relations with Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;6	`` We must re-energize our economic relations immediately , '' he said , urging closer cooperation in technology , entertainment industries and tourism .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;7	`` We must strengthen one another 's competitive capacity on American , European , Asian and international markets , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;8	`` This is the best way to energize relations between Canada and France , and Canada and Europe , and to fight the temptation of isolation . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;9	He noted that France and Canada were well placed to influence transatlantic trade policy , because France holds the rotating presidency of the EU for the first half of 1995 and Canada will host next year 's Group of Seven economic summit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0081;10	Chretien was to meet later Friday with President Francois Mitterrand and Premier Edouard Balladur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;0	With pleas to end vote-rigging and campaign violence , Taiwan wrapped up weeks of fierce campaigning for a local election Saturday that confronts the island 's rulers with their sternest electoral test in 45 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;1	The elections , a milestone in Taiwan 's seven-year shift from virtual dictatorship to democracy , could profoundly affect the future of this economically powerful but diplomatically isolated island .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;2	Victory for the opposition in the races for island governor and mayors of the two main cities would be a severe blow to President Lee Teng-hui 's prospects for another term in 1996 , when Taiwan holds its first direct presidential election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;3	It also could buffet Taiwan 's fragile relationship with Communist China , its longtime rival .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;4	Where Lee 's Nationalists cling to the old doctrine of reunification with China , the opposition Democratic Progressive Party advocates Taiwanese independence , something China has vowed to resist by force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;5	So although the election is largely a local affair , it has sparked heated debate among Taiwanese about their identity , the island 's international isolation and the Chinese giant across the Taiwan Straits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;6	On Thursday , to cries of outrage from the DPP , heads of three major chambers of commerce placed newspaper ads warning that Taiwan 's dollar and the island 's appeal to investors would plummet if pro-independence forces gained power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;7	The DPP may profit from a split in the Nationalist vote caused by the recently formed New Party , which quit the Nationalists , claiming they had abandoned the ideology of reunification .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;8	The Nationalists have ruled Taiwan since 1949 when they fled Mao Tse-tung 's Communists on mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;9	They ruled Taiwan by martial law until 1987 before embarking on a bloodless democratic revolution that culminates Saturday in the first election of a governor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;10	Voters also will choose a provincial assembly , local councilors , and mayors for Taipei and Kaohsiung , which have n't elected their mayors since 1967 and 1979 respectively .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;11	The DPP 's Chen Shui-bian is thought to be a front-runner to become the capital 's mayor , while Nationalist James Soong has a 50-40 lead over the DPP 's Chen Ting-nan in the gubernatorial race , according to the most recent surveys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;12	Newspapers predict that up to 70 percent of Taiwan 's 13.8 million eligible voters will turn out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;13	The 11,825 polling stations open at 8:00 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- , and results are expected about eight hours after polls close at 4 p.m. -LRB- 0800 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;14	The campaign has been characterized by an almost carnival atmosphere marred by violence that has left some Taiwanese unnerved by the democratic experience .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;15	`` We all have a responsibility to make the poll a success , '' the China News said in an editorial Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;16	`` Otherwise the nation 's political transformation from authoritarianism to pluralism will suffer a severe setback . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0082;17	Premier Lien Chan instructed officials Thursday to guard against violence , newspapers said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0082;23	The Nationalists said the money was payment for volunteers distributing campaign leaflets .

APW_ENG_19941202.0085;0	`` Asian values '' are no excuse for corrupt and despotic rule , Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;1	He said that while the West is guilty of `` patronizing and condescending postures , '' the term `` Asian values '' too often is used to justify `` autocratic practices and denial of basic rights and civil liberties . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;2	He called this Asian attitude `` altogether shameful . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;3	Ibrahim 's speech to a symposium on `` ` Asian Values ' and the Media 's Role in Society '' was a spirited contribution to the debate that has raged in recent years between East and West over the merits of their respective societies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;4	That debate pits advocates of free speech , individual liberties and human rights against some Asian leaders who say such rights are not applicable in their countries , which are still struggling for stability and human rights of a different sort , like freedom from hunger and disease .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;5	Although Malaysia has been prominent in accusing the West of hitting Asia with double standards , Ibrahim sought to show that the arguments on both sides are flawed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;6	He said Asians , in their growing self-confidence over their economic performance , had not shown `` a proportionate awareness '' of their shortcomings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;7	`` In all honesty , we must admit that we are still struggling to eradicate the vestiges of the so-called Oriental despotism , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;8	Asia has to `` vigorously develop and fortify the institutions of civil society ... promote the rule of laws rather than of men , and foster the cultivation of a free and responsible press , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;9	Ibrahim also took issue with the notion promoted by some governments , including that of his neighbor , Singapore , who justify their harsh penal codes and detention without trial on the grounds that social stability outweighs individual rights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;10	`` It is certainly wrong to regard society as a kind of false god upon whose altar the individual must constantly be sacrificed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0085;11	`` No Asian tradition can be cited to support the proposition that in Asia the individual must melt into the faceless community . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0087;0	Police evicted hunger-striking leaders of East Germany 's reformed communists from their own offices in the Berlin parliament building early Friday , so they resumed their interrupted slumber in a theater .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;1	The leaders of the Party of Democratic Socialism -LRB- PDS -RRB- began the fast Wednesday to protest a 67 million mark -LRB- dlrs 43 million -RRB- tax levy they called an unjust political attempt to bankrupt and destroy them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;2	The politicians , seven including the intellectually agile parliamentary leader Gregor Gysi , initially occupied two federal offices but were removed by police on Wednesday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;3	Some 3,000 sympathizers held rallies and sit-ins in Berlin , Schwerin and Dresden on Thursday in support of the party leaders , who were sleeping on cots in their parliamentary offices when police roused and evicted them shortly after midnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;4	The parliament 's president , Hanna-Renate Laurien , condemned `` this hunger strike spectacle '' as `` an abuse of the parliament building . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;5	The hunger strikers groggily repaired to a theater across from their party headquarters in east Berlin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;6	The levy the party is fighting was assessed by Berlin tax authorities based on property sales in the first half of 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;7	At the time , just months before German unification , the newly created PDS held vast assets as successor to the communists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;8	A large portion of those assets are now controlled by an independent federal commission that is supposed to determine how much of the property they can keep and how much belongs to the people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;9	The PDS asked the commission to pay the tax bill .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;10	The commission refused , but its board raised questions about why Berlin tax authorities had assessed the PDS in the first place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;11	A court ruled Thursday that the PDS would only have to pay 3 million marks -LRB- dlrs 1.8 million -RRB- security for the moment , pending further efforts to try to settle the dispute .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;12	But party leaders said they would not pay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;13	The party won 20 percent of the vote in eastern Germany in Oct. 16 national elections , thanks mainly to resentment among eastern Germans who feel they have been demoted to second-class status in united Germany .
APW_ENG_19941202.0087;14	Chancellor Helmut Kohl has attacked the PDS as `` red-painted fascists , '' and Gysi , a lawyer , has been battered by accusations that in decades past he betrayed the secrets of his dissident clients to the East German secret police .

APW_ENG_19941202.0090;0	Businessmen in Bangladesh are making an appeal to the government and opposition parties to end a nine-month-long political crisis that has disrupted the economy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;1	The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry will meet on Sunday to discuss ways of getting rival politicians to negotiate an end to the crisis , Salman Rahman , a spokesman for the federation told reporters Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;2	`` We will tell the politicians that their conflict is hurting the economy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;3	They must resolve their dispute as soon as possible , '' said Rahman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;4	An offer by the federation to mediate was rejected by the opposition parties last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;5	The opposition wants Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to resign and set up a caretaker government to conduct general elections immediately .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;6	Elections are not due until 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;7	Mrs. Zia has agreed to share power with the opposition in an interim government to oversee balloting at the end of her five-year term in 1996 , but the offer has been rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;8	After a boycott of Parliament by all opposition lawmakers since March failed to persuade the government , the opposition resorted to strikes and street demonstrations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;9	The federation estimates that each day of closure due to strikes cost the economy 1,500 million takas -LRB- dlrs 38 million -RRB- in production , sales and export losses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;10	Last month , opposition parties enforced at least four one-day strikes and they have planned another 48-hour strike next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;11	Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations with an average annual per capita income of dlrs 215 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0090;12	`` We will tell the government and the opposition that the political instability will ruin the economy and take it behind by 100 years , '' Rahman said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;0	The leftist-dominated parliament on Friday easily rejected President Lech Walesa 's veto against increased personal income tax rates for 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;1	With a 327-93 vote with two abstentions , the powerful lower chamber , or Sejm , exceeded by 45 votes the two-thirds majority required to override presidential vetoes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;2	The vote proved the strength of the government coalition of former communists and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 's Polish Peasants ' Party , which dominate the chamber .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;3	During the debate Thursday , the lawmakers and finance ministry officials said accepting the veto would have reduced 1995 government revenues by about 13 trillion zlotys -LRB- dlrs 542 million -RRB- , further decreasing next year 's limited spending in the deficit-ridden budget .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;4	Walesa vetoed last week the increase of tax rates from 20 to 21 percent , from 30 to 33 and from 40 to 45 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;5	The higher rates were temporarily raised for 1994 , but the government had promised to return to previous levels in 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;6	According to Walesa , higher taxes threatened the stability of the tax system and of the economy and hampered long-term planning in enterprises .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;7	Walesa argued that the society had expected lower taxes , as promised in earlier parliament decisions and pointed out that the government should improve tax collecting , rather than reach into the pockets of pensioners , unemployed and modestly earning employees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;8	Leftist lawmakers said the veto protected those earning the most and was designed to prop up Walesa 's dwindling popularity in face of next year presidential elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0091;9	In a last-minute deal aimed at swiftly throwing out Walesa 's veto , the government received support from the 42-deputy Labor Union party caucus , which has roots in the Solidarity trade Union , but gradually becomes the most leftist parliamentary group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;0	Japan 's current account surplus dropped 19 percent in October from the same month last year to dlrs 8.9 billion , in the third straight month of decline , the Finance Ministry announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;1	The current account is a broad measure of a country 's international economic flows , including trade , services and tourism .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;2	It registers a surplus when more money comes into a country than goes out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;3	Japan 's current account surplus was dlrs 11.03 billion in October 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;4	Even though the current account has declined for three months in dollar terms , many economists are still hesitant to call it a sustained trend , noting that the surpluses remain large and stem mainly from structural factors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;5	The trade component of the current account fell 10 percent in the month to dlrs 11.13 billion , as imports rose 24 percent from a year earlier to dlrs 22.19 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;6	Exports rose 10 percent to dlrs 33.32 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;7	Japan 's deficit in services widened by 80 percent to dlrs 1.70 billion from a year earlier as more Japanese tourists went abroad to take advantage of the high value of the yen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0092;8	Trade figures in the current account are based on settled contracts , and are different from the more widely circulated trade figures announced separately by the ministry each month based on customs-clearance data .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;0	As many as 10,000 Chinese may be infected with the AIDS virus , and 22 have died of the disease since China discovered its first case in 1985 , an official report said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;1	By the end of July this year , 1,453 people in China had tested positive for the AIDS virus , HIV .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;2	Of those , 1,174 were Chinese citizens , 31 were overseas Chinese and 230 were foreigners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;3	But Wang Youfa , of the China Xiehe Medical College , wrote in the Guangming Daily that AIDS tests in China have so far been administered only among high-risk groups .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;4	`` The actual infection rate is far higher .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;5	Chinese experts estimate that the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- mainland currently as 5,000 to 10,000 HIV carriers , '' Wang said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;6	He urged better control of the deadly disease , but proposed no specific measures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;7	Most Chinese still have little knowledge of the disease and how it is spread .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;8	Some believe that they can catch it through dirty bed sheets or from underwear laundered by hotels or laundromats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;9	AIDS is most commonly spread through sexual contact , contaminated needles shared by drug users , infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;10	The Chinese government long has characterized AIDS as a disease that strikes only foreigners or fringe groups such as drug users and homosexuals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;11	Prevention measures were directed at foreigners coming to China and at Chinese with frequent contacts with foreigners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;12	Chinese health officials were shocked in 1990 when they discovered 146 HIV-positive drug users in southwest China 's Yunnan province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;13	Since then , the figure has ballooned to 1,133 cases , or 79 percent of the national total , Wang said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;14	The province borders Burma , which produces much of the world 's heroin , and has China 's most serious drug problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;15	The report said the infection rate among Yunnan 's intravenous drug users was as high as 78 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;16	Drug users account for 66 percent of the HIV carriers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;17	The virus has spread to 22 of China 's 39 provinces , Wang said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;18	Of the 40 Chinese citizens who have developed full-blown AIDS , 22 have already died , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;19	Non-Chinese citizens with the HIV virus are deported from China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;20	In some disturbing trends , 19 people were infected by their spouses , and eight are less than 15 years old , Wang said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;21	He added that outside of Yunnan , sexual relations was the main mode of transmission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0093;22	Previous reports have also said that contaminated blood products accounted for more than a dozen AIDS victims .

APW_ENG_19941202.0095;0	Swedish divers on Friday planned to survey the wreck of the sunken ferry Estonia , a Baltic Sea tomb for an estimated 800 victims of the tragedy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;1	The divers , making the first human surveillance of the wreck , intend to scrutizine the condition of the ship , which is resting on its side in 56-84 meters -LRB- 180-280 feet -RRB- of water off Finland 's southwestern coast , the news agency TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;2	`` The weather conditions are good .

APW_ENG_19941202.0095;4	The divers are to gather evidence to help authorities decide the feasibility of retreiving the bodies or taking some other action to preserve them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;5	More than 800 bodies are believed entombed in the wreck , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;6	According to the latest official count , 136 people survived and 913 died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;7	Only 94 bodies have bee recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;8	Swedish authorities were focusing on three options , none of which included raising the entire wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;9	Divers could scour the wreck to retreive the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;10	The last alternative would be leaving all the bodies and filling the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;11	The divers are using a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0095;12	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed due to poor conditions .

APW_ENG_19941202.0096;6	The congress is an umbrella organization for Shiite , Sunni and Kuridish groups opposed to Saddam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0096;7	Its leaders are meeting this week in northern Iraq to try to broaden the group by bringing more anti-Saddam factions into its executive committee , the London sources said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0098;0	Air raids continued today over Chechnya , and Russian media reported that volunteers from throughout the Caucasus were coming to aid the separatist republic 's embattled president .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;1	The Interfax news agency reported rocket attacks early today on an airfield and two towns east of Grozny , the Chechen capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;2	It gave no details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;3	On Thursday , a small airfield near Grozny was hit in an air raid and four people died in a missile attack at Katayama , about 12 miles from Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;4	The city of 300,000 has become a war zone between forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , who declared independence from Moscow in 1991 , and Chechen rebels trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;5	Dudayev accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels , who launched an offensive last week that began with helicopters and escalated in recent days to jet fighters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;6	Thousands of people have fled the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;7	Russia says it has given the rebels only political support .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;8	It refuses to recognize independence for Chechnya , which was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;9	Russian newspapers today were filled with reports that volunteers from neighboring republics in the volatile Caucasus Mountains were arriving in Chechnya to fend off a Russian invasion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;10	The reports could not be confirmed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;11	President Boris Yeltsin threatened to send in troops unless both Dudayev and his opponents stopped fighting and freed their prisoners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;12	But as neither side complied , Yeltsin on Thursday offered amnesty to those who `` voluntarily lay down arms by Dec. 15 . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;13	In spite of Yeltsin 's more conciliatory tone , there are substantial Russian troop buildups near the Chechen border , Russian media have reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;14	In Freedom Square outside Dudayev 's offices Thursday , several hundred volunteer fighters cradling Kalashnikov rifles and grenade launchers gathered to hear speeches while a tank maneuvered into position .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;15	Elders in tall fur hats , tunics and high leather boots danced in a circle , chanting , `` Freedom or death ! ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;16	Chechnya has oil reserves and is considered important in securing Russia 's hold in the Caucasus region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;17	But Moscow also considers Chechnya a destabilizing force for the rest of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0098;18	Chechen criminal gangs are notorious in the Russian capital , and this year Chechen gunmen were blamed for many of the rash of hijackings in southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;0	A beautiful Russian Orthodox cross an Idaho man secreted out of the communist country 27 years ago is returning to the faithful in Boise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;1	`` It really needs to go home , '' Quinten Crockett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;2	`` It means a lot to me .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;3	But it means more to them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;4	On Sunday , Crockett will give the cross to the St. Seraphim of Sarov Russian Orthodox Church in Boise during a special service .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;5	`` The cross in our church is a very powerful symbol of our victory over sin , '' said the Rev. David Moser , St. Seraphim 's minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;6	`` We tend to look at things that have survived the ravages of times and persecutions as kind of special .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;7	They are a symbol of our ability to overcome trial . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;8	Crockett bought the cross on the Russian black market 27 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;9	A man approached him with an offer to sell religious icons , but only for American money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;10	They agreed on a purchase price : $ 10 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;11	The cross 's history is uncertain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;12	But many similar icons were taken from Russian Orthodox churches and hidden during the Russian Revolution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;13	Tiny figures in relief depict the crucifixion of Christ .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;14	On the back are words scratched in old Slavic , a language all but gone in Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;15	Crockett knew all religious materials were considered property of the state and would be confiscated when he left the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;16	But he outsmarted border guards by stuffing the 18-inch icon down his pants and covering the top with his untucked shirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;17	Crockett kept the cross as a memento of his trip and of the people he met in the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;18	`` The same spirit I feel in the Mormon Temple , I felt in the Orthodox churches , '' said Crockett , who is LDS .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;19	The cross is believed to have come from a small country church .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;20	`` And it 's going to go to a little church , '' Crockett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;21	`` It 's time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0100;22	It 's like if someone had an old , original Book of Mormon and was n't sharing it with anyone . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;1	The allies opened daylong talks with counterparts from nearly two-dozen nations in Eastern Europe in a session likely to be dominated by Russia 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;3	He also backed out of a program to improve cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;4	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd before Friday 's talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;5	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;6	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met separately with Kozyrev for more than an hour Friday to discuss the dispute as well as the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;7	They `` worked toward a clarification of some of the issues the foreign minister raised last night , '' said State Department spokesman Mike McCurry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;8	Although NATO and East European officials intended to answer Kozyrev 's questions at the meeting , McCurry said it was unlikely the Russian would change his mind immediately and agree on the new cooperation plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;9	Willy Claes , secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the formal session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;10	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;11	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;12	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;13	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;14	`` It 's our problem and the alliance 's problem -- not the Russians ' , '' said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;15	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;16	The Russian outburst pushed , at least temporarily , the crisis in Bosnia off the ministers ' agenda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;17	Christopher , Hurd and Kozyrev were meeting later in the day with Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe of France and Klaus Kinkel of Germany to try to revive the peace process in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;18	Christopher wants formal approval from the others for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;19	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;20	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;21	`` The essence of any peace plan is a very substantial Bosnian Serb withdrawal ... and continuance of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its own borders , '' Hurd told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;22	Juppe and Hurd plan to fly to Belgrade this weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;23	The NATO allies , in trying to meet East Europeans demands for membership without upsetting Russia , thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;24	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;25	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;26	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;27	To overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , NATO had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;28	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;29	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;30	Kozyrev refused to endorse a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts with Moscow intended to ease Russia 's fears .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;31	McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0101;32	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;0	The IRA expects negotiations about weapons with the British to include security force arms as well as it own hidden arsenals , the movement 's political allies signalled Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;1	`` We 're prepared , perfectly prepared , to discuss the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland , both legal and illegal , '' Mitchel McLoughlin , a spokesman for Sinn Fein , said on BBC radio .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;2	Britain and Sinn Fein are to start talks in Belfast on Wednesday , the next big step in the search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland following the 3-month-old cease-fire by the IRA in its battle to end British rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;3	Martin McGuinness , a former IRA commander who will lead the Sinn Fein team , has said for the first time that the future of the IRA weapons , mostly hidden over the border in the Republic of Ireland would be discussed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;4	Michael Mates , a British legislator and former minister sometimes used by the government to argue publicly with Sinn Fein , said the change of heart was `` very good news . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;5	`` Only a month ago Martin McGuinness was saying ` if I asked the IRA to hand over their weapons they 'd laugh ' , '' Mates said on the same program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;6	He maintained that Protestant politicians would not negotiate directly with the Catholic-based Sinn Fein or the IRA `` while behind while behind that organization is still the threat of returning to violence if they do n't get their way . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;7	Sinn Fein 's Mitchell , however , said the IRA would need evidence of real progress in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0102;8	Only then , he said , would it be `` realistic to go to those who have weapons and say ` we believe the conditions now exist where it would be possible and practical to take the gun out of Irish politics forever . '' '

APW_ENG_19941202.0110;0	Swiss pharmaceutical giant Ciba-Geigy AG said Friday that it has signed an agreement with three Chinese partners to develop and market a new drug to combat malaria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;1	The new drug will combine two anti-malarial substances -- artemether and benflumetol -- which work together to produce a `` highly effective '' treatment that can be administered over a short time , Ciba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;2	Benflumetol was developed at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology in Beijing ; artemether is an existing treatment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;3	`` In developing this new drug with our Chinese partners , we will meet an urgent medical need in many countries , '' a company statement said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;4	The disease afflicts between 300 and 500 million people a year , killing about 2 million of them , the World Health Organization says .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;5	The company said the drug could be brought to market as early as 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;6	China has already conducted clinical trials , and further tests are planned in Africa , East Asia and Europe in the next two or three years , Ciba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;7	Ciba , Switzerland 's largest chemical and pharmaceuticals group , said it signed the agreement with the Beijing institute and the Kunming Pharmaceutical Factory in Kunming and CITIC Technology Inc. of Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0110;8	The venture will produce the active substances for the new drug .

APW_ENG_19941202.0111;0	Their luxury cruise cut short by an inferno of smoke and fire , nearly 1,000 weary passengers and crew members of the abandoned Achille Lauro steamed toward safe ports Friday in a motley fleet of warships and cargo freighters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;1	Two elderly passengers died and eight were injured after fire erupted in the engine room of the Achille Lauro before dawn Wednesday and spread to engulf the ship , despite efforts by the crew to contain it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;2	`` The fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down toward the cabins , '' survivor Tony Webb was quoted as telling London 's Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;3	`` At about 8 a.m. , the captain said the fire was too strong and we would have to abandon ship , '' added Webb , 44 , a Briton living in Cape Town , South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;4	Passengers clad in evening clothes and bed dress clambered aboard life boats and rafts and evacuated the ship , followed sometime later by the fire-fighting team and , finally , the captain , Giuseppe Orsi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;5	`` From what I saw , -LRB- the ship -RRB- is gone , '' Orsi said by radio from one of the rescue ships Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;6	The Achille Lauro was adrift in the Indian Ocean off Somalia on Friday , listing badly to port and still smoldering , its troubled history apparently nearing an end .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;7	The ship 's name burst into headlines in 1985 when the Achille Lauro was hijacked by Palestinian terrorists who killed a wheelchair-bound American and dumped his body overboard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;8	The terrorists escaped the vessel and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;9	Eight cargo vessels and two American warships , the USS Gettysburg and Halyburton , carried the Achille Lauro 's surviving passengers and crew members toward Djibouti , Mombasa in Kenya and Muscat , Oman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0111;10	Most were heading for Mombasa but none of the rescue ships was expected to dock before Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;0	The opposition felt it was being denied equal TV time in Taiwan 's local election campaign , so it has taken the law into its own hands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;1	The result is TNT , a pirate station that does daily battle with the ruling Nationalist Party from the bedroom of a rented Taipei apartment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;2	It 's part of an explosion in pirate TV and radio broadcasting , always lively though sometimes abusive , by critics who feel the Nationalists have been too slow in relaxing their 45-year grip on the electronic media .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;3	TNT -- Taiwan News Telecommunication -- is funded by the Democratic Progressive Party , the main opposition , which claims Taiwan 's three major networks are biased toward Nationalist candidates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;4	Those networks are controlled by the Nationalists , the military and the provincial government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;5	There are others transmitting on cable , including some that support the DPP and one that supports the New Party , a Nationalist splinter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;6	But Mike Chang , who founded TNT with some friends , says their station is the first in Taipei to broadcast over the airwaves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;7	`` We had to break through the media domination by the Nationalist Party , which we think is not good for society , '' he said in an interview during a break from presenting Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;8	They broadcast on channel 12 , hoping to net viewers who stray from 11 , the government channel , Chang said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;9	He does not know how many viewers TNT has , but TNT radio , which began in March , claims 300,000 regular listeners among Taipei 's 2.6 million people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;10	Chang charges that instead of educating the public about the election issues and candidates , the Nationalists `` are doing a lousy job , insulting the people . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;11	The polls for governor and for mayors of Taiwan 's two largest cities are the sternest electoral test for the Nationalists since they fled to Taiwan from Communist China in 1949 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;12	Never before have Taiwanese elected their governor and the last mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung were in 1967 and 1979 respectively .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;13	Pirate stations would have been unthinkable before the Nationalists lifted martial law in 1987 and initiated Taiwan 's shift from virtual dictatorship to democracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;14	Today , they are forums for Taiwanese to oppose everything from Nationalist policies to nuclear power stations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;15	But being a pirate is not without risks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;16	In July , police raided 14 pirate radio stations , including TNT , and confiscated their equipment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;17	So far , however , the TV station has been left alone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;18	Chang suspects the government does n't want a repeat of the riots that followed the July raids .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;19	Chang said TNT is editorially independent but shares many DPP points of view , including its support for making Taiwan independent , as opposed to the Nationalist doctrine of reunification with the mainland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;20	TNT TV follows DPP candidates on the campaign trail and at DPP rallies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;21	The station also invites academics and commentators to a daily discussion show , with viewers phoning in .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;22	A bedroom serves as a studio shared by TV and radio , with black drapes providing a backdrop .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;23	Chang and his guests sit around tables pushed together and covered with a table cloth that has seen better days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;24	As they talk , Ah Gui , the lone cameraman , dashes between two cameras on tripods .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;25	Chang claims the government 's licensing laws are too stringent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0112;26	`` We would like to follow the law , '' he says , `` but the law must be reasonable . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;0	NATO foreign ministers sought today to reassure Russia that the alliance 's plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new divide in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;1	The allies opened daylong talks with their counterparts from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics in a session likely to be dominated by Russia 's unexpected opposition to a plan to expand the alliance in coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;2	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned the ministers Thursday by protesting the plan for drawing up conditions for future NATO membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;3	He also announced Russia 's withdrawal from a program to improve military and political cooperation between Moscow and NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;4	Secretary of State Warren Christopher met separately with Kozyrev for more than an hour today to discuss the dispute as well as the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;5	They `` worked toward a clarification of some of the issues the foreign minister raised last night , '' said State Department spokesman Mike McCurry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;6	Willy Claes , secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the formal session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;7	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;8	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over Thursday 's meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;9	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;10	Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski , said the foreign ministers would `` explain everything to the Russians -- that -LRB- membership plans -RRB- are n't against them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;11	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;12	The Russian outburst temporarily pushed the crisis in Bosnia off the ministers ' agenda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;13	Christopher and Kozyrev were to meet later today with the foreign ministers of France , Britain and Germany to try to revive efforts to end the 2 -LCB- - year Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;14	Christopher wants formal approval from the others for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia , including a cease-fire around the U.N. `` safe area '' of Bihac and a pledge to stop fighting nationwide for three to six months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;15	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for political ties to Serb-controlled Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;16	The NATO allies , in trying to meet East Europeans ' demands for membership without upsetting Russia , thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;17	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;18	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;19	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms , costs and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;20	In an effort to ease Russian fears about its eastward expansion , the NATO allies had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;21	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;22	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told a group of grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;23	McCurry said Kozyrev gave no advance warning that he wanted clarification of the schedule for considering new NATO members next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0113;24	`` I would be tempted to say it has to do with domestic politics in Russia , '' McCurry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0114;0	A yellow fever oubreak has killed at least 300 people in Nigeria , a news agency said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0114;1	The News Agency of Nigeria said the outbreak began two weeks ago in the Orsu area of eastern Imo state and spread to neighboring Orlu area , where at least 50 victims have been hospitalized .
APW_ENG_19941202.0114;2	Imo state government reportedly had given 25,000 naira -LRB- more than dlrs 1,000 -RRB- to local administrators to buy vaccines , but doctors at three hospitals in the area said none had arrived , the agency said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0114;3	Outbreaks of easily preventable and treatable diseases often kill dozens of people in Nigeria , where an economic crisis fueled by corruption has broken down health services .
APW_ENG_19941202.0114;4	Yellow fever was wiped out by vaccination before independence from Britain in 1960 but has been resurgent since .
APW_ENG_19941202.0115;0	Masked anarchists defending a squatter camp hurled paving stones and Molotov cocktails early Friday at police trying to evict them , injuring 22 officers , city authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0115;1	The five-hour struggle against some 100 leftist rioters ended about 4 a.m. after police used an armored vehicle to break through a perimeter barricade the anarchists had erected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0115;2	Police , who also used water cannon against the bandana-masked demonstrators , were trying to enforce a court order to remove the camp , but left the scene without succeeding .
APW_ENG_19941202.0115;3	The squatters had built a head-high barrier of doors , window frames , tables , shopping carts and two of the seven disputed mobile homes at a square in the city 's Karolinen quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0115;4	Parts of the barricade were set on fire and police used water cannon to extinguish the blazes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .

APW_ENG_19941202.0116;19	`` This communique raises more questions than it answers , '' Kozyrev said in impromptu remarks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;20	`` We have to understand what are the intentions of the other partners . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;21	Claes immediately tried to reassure Kozyrev that NATO was n't shifting direction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;22	`` It is no change in strategy or policy of NATO .

APW_ENG_19941202.0116;25	Kozyrev 's outburst added to the woes of an alliance long strained by U.S.-European disputes over dealing with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;26	In an effort to mend the rift , Christopher swung behind the European view that diplomacy , not force , is the best way to deal with the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0116;27	It was a major policy switch by Washington under pressure particularly from Britain and France .

APW_ENG_19941202.0118;0	PLO chief Yasser Arafat met with an Islamic opposition leader in Gaza Friday and formed a reconciliation committee to work out future differences and prevent violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;1	The meeting between Arafat and Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar ended two weeks of tense uncertainty in the Gaza Strip , sparked by a bloody confrontation between PLO police and Islamic activists on Nov. 18 that left 15 dead .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;2	`` Both sides agreed this morning that the most important thing is to try and overcome obstacles and conquer this crisis , '' said Arafat advisor Ahmed Tibi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;3	`` The Palestinians can not achieve peace without being unified , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;4	Arafat faced off against the Islamic Resistance Movement , or Hamas , after Israel demanded that he crack down on militants responsible for attacks that left 32 Israelis dead in October and November alone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;5	Hamas and the more extremist Islamic Jihad organization oppose the peace accord that Arafat signed with the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;6	But Arafat ca n't afford to ignore the grassroots support for the militant groups , especially among the poor , and is trying to woo them into participating in his self-rule government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;7	Tibi said Friday 's meeting was the start of a `` real dialogue between the sides . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;8	Another Israeli-Arab who served as a mediator , Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish , called the meeting `` a gate of hope for the Palestinians . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;9	Darwish said that Hamas no longer rejected an Arafat-appointed judiciary probe into the Nov. 18 violence and had agreed to drop accusations blaming the Palestinian Authority for the clashes until investigators published their results .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;10	`` It was a warm and fruitful meeting between myself and my brother and what we have agreed on is good for both sides , '' Zahar told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0118;11	Tibi said the nine-member committee , that includes Hamas and PLO officials as well as two Israeli Arabs , would meet Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;0	A ferry carrying more than 600 people collided with a Singapore-registered freighter and sank before dawn Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 34 people , the Coast Guard reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;1	Coast Guard spokesman Amado Samante said 451 passengers had been rescued .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;2	The bodies of 34 people who had drowned had also been recovered , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;3	The search for the remaining passengers was called off late in the day because of darkness and was to resume Saturday morning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;4	William Lines , which own the 2,452-ton ferry , the Cebu City , said the ferry had 608 people on board .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;5	There was no immediate official report on the cause of the accident , but the ferry 's owner said it had been rammed by the Kota Suria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;6	Eugene Espedido , vice president of the company , said it was preparing a request for the coast guard to detain the freighter and its crew .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;7	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the Kota Suria 's bow crashed into the Cebu City , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;8	He said ship captain Wesceslao Lampong and several other officers were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;9	Erwin Maravilla , one of the first survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol , said his family was sleeping at the time of the accident .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;10	He lost both of his two children and his wife , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;11	`` I was lucky to be able to swim to the surface .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;12	Otherwise I would be dead , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;13	The 12,500-ton Kota Suria , with a crew of 26 , was damaged in its bow but joined the rescue effort , carrying 230 of those saved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;14	President Fidel Ramos ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;15	Maximo Calamba , 38 , who survived with his wife Veneranda , 30 , and 1-year-old son Marcelo , complained that the ferry crew failed to inform them about the approaching freighter and did not help people evacuate the ship after the collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;16	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;17	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own , '' Calamba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;18	`` When we were rescued by the Suria I could still hear crying out for help . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;19	Radio station DZRH , reporting from an airplane overhead , said at least eight patrol boats , a search and rescue ship and several other inter-island ferries were involved in the rescue effort .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;20	William Lines said the Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;21	It sank near the mouth of Manila Bay near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;22	It had left the port of Manila bound for Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;23	Quirimon Tan , William Lines vice president , said each of the dead passengers was covered by 50,000 pesos -LRB- dlrs 2,173 -RRB- in insurance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;24	He said the company would also pay for medical and funeral expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;25	In a quirk of timing , the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved William Lines ' initial public offering .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;26	The company is selling 235 million shares for between 9.65 pesos -LRB- 41 U.S. cents -RRB- and 15.15 pesos -LRB- 65 cents -RRB- a share .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;27	An analyst who asked not to be named said the accident would probably not drag down the stock issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0119;28	The Philippines ' worst peacetime ferry disaster was in December 1987 , when 3,537 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;0	Congressional clearance of a new world trade accord is expected to encourage ratification by other countries , enabling the mammoth export-boosting pact to enter into force as planned Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;1	Around the world , big and small nations alike are trying to rush the 22,000 page GATT agreement through national parliaments , often in low-key processes that contrast with the rocky ride through the U.S. legislature .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;2	Nearly 40 countries , including the United States and most of southeast Asia , have ratified the 124-nation pact .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;3	About 40 more -- including trade giants Japan , the European Union and Canada -- have indicated they will do so by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;4	Four countries -- Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Cyprus and Poland -- have already told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that domestic politics will prevent them from ratifying the accord this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;5	But this wo n't stop the pact from taking effect as scheduled on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;6	All that is needed is for the all the big traders to come on board as founding members of the World Trade Organization -- GATT 's more powerful successor body that implement the accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;7	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to free world trade and is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;8	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;9	Most governments object to at least some provisions because previously protected industries -- such as agriculture in Europe and textiles in the United States -- will suffer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;10	But all participating countries agreed not to upset the carefully crafted compromises with amendments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;11	The ratification situation in some of the main trading nations is as follows : -- European Union : Britain , Ireland , Greece and Germany have approved it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;12	The eight other EU members are meant to do so before foreign ministers meet Dec. 19-20 to approve the deal on behalf of the entire trade bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;13	France and Portugal still have some qualms , but the EU Commission , the union 's executive body , said there are no real obstacles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;14	An internal dispute between the Commission and member states over negotiating powers , which slowed national ratification , has been settled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;15	-- Japan : A key parliamentary committee has approved the deal , and full passage is likely in the next few days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;16	The government placated rice farmers , upset at potential competition from imports , with a six-year , 7.2 trillion yen -LRB- dlrs 74 billion -RRB- compensation package .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;17	-- South Korea : The ruling Democratic Liberal party , which has a big majority , plans to push the accord through the national assembly next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;18	Opposition politicians and farmers accuse the government of making too many concessions under U.S. pressure to open the rice market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;19	There have been frequent violent demonstrations against the accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;20	-- India : There was strong opposition from both left - and right-wing parties , especially to provisions that give foreign multinationals stronger patent claims to Indian seeds and medicines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;21	The opposition , however , seems to have run out of steam and legislative passage appears more or less certain , though no date has been set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;22	-- Canada : Hopes to ratify the accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;23	-- Mexico : Under former President Salinas de Gortari , who is one of three candidates for the directorship of the WTO , Mexico was one of the first countries to ratify the trade accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;24	-- South America : Chile has ratified the accord and Argentina hopes to do so before the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;25	In Brazil , parliamentary passage is likely to be in February , not because the accord is contested but because of delays caused by this year 's election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;26	-- China : In order to join the WTO , Beijing first has to enter GATT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0121;27	Western concerns about China 's market reform programs and a possible flood of Chinese exports mean GATT membership talks are unlikely to finish by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;0	Harassed and humiliated by Serbs , the United Nations on Friday dispatched a senior envoy to try to end detention of hundreds of peacekeepers and a freeze on U.N. movements in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;1	Officials hoped that Yasushi Akashi , the top U.N. official in former Yugoslavia , would have more success than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was rebuffed in even trying to meet with the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;2	Akashi arrived Friday morning in Sarajevo for meetings with Bosnian government officials , and was to continue on to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale , outside Sarajevo , later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;3	Akashi 's talks would follow a meeting Thursday between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;4	A U.N. source said Karadzic promised to try to help , but added that such promises often are empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;5	Spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi wanted to discuss fighting around the government enclave of Bihac with Karadzic , as well as an end to restrictions on the movement of U.N. troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;6	Thant said Bihac , scene of heavy fighting for weeks , was quiet overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;7	But strong Serb forces , which have seized 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe zone '' encompassing the town of Bihac and environs , remained in the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;8	The United Nations has said the Serbs , from both Croatia and Bosnia , appeared strong enough to capture Bihac if they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;9	There were signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;10	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;11	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;12	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Croatian Serb forces also had shelled his forces across the border near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;13	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;14	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said Thursday that Bosnian Serb units in the Bihac area crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers from an observation post Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;15	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;16	More than 400 of the 24,000 U.N. soldiers in Bosnia are being detained by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;17	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;18	The Serbs also have been ignoring U.N. requests to send supply convoys across territory they hold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;19	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said Thursday that food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;20	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;21	The Serbs repeatedly have rejected an international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;22	With the threat of international force appearing to dissipate , their position is hardening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;23	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;24	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;25	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;26	The peace plan they rejected would give the Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;27	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0122;28	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;0	A Russian journalist said Friday he received a fax from a group threatening Russians abroad if Moscow does not recognize the independence of a rebellious southern territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;1	Igor Pavlov , head of the Copenhagen office of Russia 's Novosti news agency , got a letter from a `` North Caucasian Liberation Army '' demanding recognition of `` the Chechnya Republic 's independence without any conditions . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;2	Chechnya , a territory in Russia 's Caucasus Mountains , sought independence from Russia in 1991 but was rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;3	Fighting broke out last week between its president , Dzhokhar Dudayev , and opponents who he says are backed by Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;4	In Denmark , the journalist said he received the English-language Wednesday evening , which included a number indicating it came from Copenhagen 's central railway station .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;5	The note said , in verbatim , `` We will consider the Russian officials as non-officials representations and hence as our military targets '' if the recognition is not granted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;6	The one-page printed fax was signed `` K.K.K.O. 130 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;7	Police said the sign-off possibly could be initials for the North Caucasian Liberation Army .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;8	Police in Copenhagen said they heard the group has been active in other countries , but not in Denmark until now .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;9	They would give no details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;10	`` Of course we take this threat seriously , '' a senior police officer said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;11	No one has been arrested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;12	The Russian embassy and the Aeroflot air carrier office in Copenhagen had not received similar threats , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;13	The domestic intelligence agency said it was investigating the case but declined to comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0125;14	The note also demanded `` Russia 's recognition of the North Caucasian Federation 's official borders '' and `` the help of the United Nations to the Caucasian people 's return to their native country from where they were expelled 130 years ago . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;0	The government outmaneuvered angry opposition lawmakers Friday to pass a 54.8 trillion won -LRB- dlrs 68.5 billion -RRB- budget for 1995 just three hours before its deadline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;1	The budget , 15.9 percent higher than the current year 's , includes a 9.9 percent increase in defense spending while hugely raising subsidies for farmers , who are angry over agricultural concessions by South Korea in the new world trade agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;2	Approval followed two weeks of political bickering over an opposition demand that the government indict former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo for engineering a 1979 military coup that put Chun in power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;3	Roh succeeded him as president in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;4	The opposition Democratic Party had boycotted the National Assembly over the issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;5	The ruling Democratic Liberal Party waited until Friday , the legal deadline , to pass the budget .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;6	Chun and Roh , while still generals , established a junta to rule the country after the death of their mentor , President Park Chung-hee .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;7	The government fears their prosecution would trigger serious political unrest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;8	With Speaker Hwang Nak-joo kept in his office by opposition politicians who blocked the door , Vice Speaker Lee Chun-koo appeared in a spectators ' gallery , convened a plenary session and announced approval of the budget .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;9	It took only 30 seconds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;10	Opposition Democrats angrily protested , but there was no violent scuffle -- a set-piece parliamentary scene during past governments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;11	Earlier Friday , the Democratic Liberals unilaterally pushed the government-drawn budget bill through an assembly budget deliberation committee after cutting 150 billion won -LRB- dlrs 187.5 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;12	The ruling party controls 171 of the 299 National Assembly seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;13	Hours before the assembly 's planned action on the budget , the Democrats abandoned their boycott and returned to try to block its passage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;14	Defense , up to 11.07 trillion won -LRB- dlrs 13.8 billion -RRB- , takes a 20 percent share of the budget , reflecting South Korea 's preoccupation with threats from North Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;15	South Korea also increased public works spending by 22 percent to 6.77 trillion won -LRB- dlrs 8.36 billion -RRB- -- much of it to tackle the country 's worsening traffic congestion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;16	But the highlight of the budget is a rise of nearly 40 percent in farm subsidies to cushion farmers and fishermen against the opening of South Korea 's markets under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;17	Subsidies in the new budget total 8.06 trillion won -LRB- dlrs 1.01 billion -RRB- -- about 1.34 million won -LRB- dlrs 1,680 -RRB- a year for each of the nation 's 6 million farmers and fishermen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;18	The government hopes to pass the GATT deal through Parliament this month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;19	The opposition has vowed to block it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;20	Farmers have staged violent protests over the government 's decision to open farm markets to foreign products .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;21	The government has used farm subsidies to buy rice at prices five or six times higher than in the United States and other countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;22	Also Friday , the assembly approved a government plan to buy 1.5 million tons of rice this year , 115,200 tons more than last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;23	Farmers fear the new trade accord might threaten their livelihood .
APW_ENG_19941202.0126;24	South Korea produces 4.75 million tons a year of rice , the nation 's main staple food .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;0	Serbs fired anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency Friday in a sign of contempt for senior U.N. officials on a new mission to end harassment of their peacekeeping troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;1	The anti-armor missiles were fired at the headquarters of the Bosnian government just before the arrival of the top U.N. official for former Yugoslavia , Yasushi Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;2	Akashi , on a mission to end detention of hundreds of peacekeepers and win freedom of movement for U.N. convoys , hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;3	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed in even trying to meet with the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides in Bosnia might lead to the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;4	Akashi arrived Friday morning in Sarajevo for meetings with Bosnian government officials , and was to continue on to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;5	He left the presidency briefly and the two missiles hit the building just before he returned for meetings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;6	A third wire-guided anti-armor missile hit a building nearby .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;7	There were no immediate reports of injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;8	Akashi 's talks with the Serbs would follow a meeting Thursday between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose .

APW_ENG_19941202.0127;24	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said Thursday that food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;25	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;26	The Serbs repeatedly have rejected an international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;27	With the threat of international force appearing to dissipate , their position is hardening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;28	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;29	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;30	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;31	The peace plan they rejected would give the Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;32	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0127;33	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;0	Legislators across the political spectrum said Friday they doubted Germany would accept NATO 's request to send fighter planes to patrol the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;1	NATO on Thursday asked Germany to send six to eight Tornado fighters equipped with electronic radar-suppression gear and rockets to destroy radar sites .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;2	They would protect allied planes involved in the U.N. humanitarian mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;3	In July , the nation 's high court ruled that combat missions overseas were legal , but must be approved by parliament , where Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's coalition has a wafer-thin majority and the opposition is leery of military adventure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;4	Defense Minister Volker Ruehe spoke out for the mission , but Klaus Rose , the chief of the defense committee in parliament for Kohl 's party , called the
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;5	request `` problematic '' because NATO 's goals in Bosnia are n't clear .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;6	The German military has n't been in combat since the disastrous Nazi era , when German troops and SS commandos killed hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews and others in the Balkans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;7	`` Given the historical component , we 're going to have to think clearly about whether we want our first combat mission to be against the Serbs , '' said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , whose Free Democrats are junior partners in Kohl 's coalition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;8	Kinkel said he doubted there was parliamentary support for the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0128;9	Kohl said he would take his time in deciding whether to push for the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0129;0	Australian Nicole Lowien shot a bogey-free 6-under-par 66 Friday and took a one-shot lead after the first round of the Mizuno Ladies Golf Tournament , the season 's final event on the Japan LPGA tour .

APW_ENG_19941202.0129;2	Nayoko Yoshikawa and Taiwan 's Huang Bie-shyun were one shot off the pace at 67 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0129;3	Michiko Hattori , Mayumi Murai and Aiko Takasu were grouped at 68 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0129;4	Ikuyo Shiotani , currently second on the Japan LPGA money list , shot a 70 and was in a group of seven players that included Marie-Laure De Lorenzi of France .
APW_ENG_19941202.0129;5	Mayumi Hirase , who leads the money list , made a slow start with a 1-over-par 73 , and was tied with Hiromi Kobayashi , a regular on the U.S. LPGA Tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0129;6	Ayako Okamoto turned in a 5-over-par 77 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0130;1	The people were taken off trains at various stations outside this central Indian city and charged for traveling without tickets -- a common practice in India usually punishable by a fine or a few hours in jail .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;2	`` Shame on you , government , '' said Abdul Jabbar Khan , of the Gas Victims Organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;3	On Dec. 2 , 1984 , a cloud of toxic chemicals leaked from a pesticide plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp. , of Danbury , Conn.
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;4	About 4,000 people died that night , and 3,000 more deaths were later attributed to the effects of the gas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;5	A half-million people are still seeking compensation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;6	Chief Minister Digvijay Singh , who is the chief executive of Madhya Pradesh state , admitted that many people were arrested on trains moving toward the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;7	But Singh could not confirm the number and said he was not sure the arrests were related to the planned anniversary rally .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;8	Tens of thousands of people routinely travel without tickets on Indian railroads every day , but few are caught and arrested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;9	Meanwhile , Khan led a march of 3,000 people from a city park to a square near the state legislature on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;10	Police barricaded the roads and red police vans patrolled the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;11	The city administration banned the assembly of people around the legislature .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;12	Khan said his group planned a bigger demonstration Saturday and called for a one-day strike in the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0130;13	He said his main demand was to clear the logjam that has blocked compensation for the victims .

APW_ENG_19941202.0134;0	Japan 's economy expanded at a robust annual rate of 3.7 percent in the July-September quarter , the Economic Planning Agency reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;1	The 0.9 percent increase from the previous quarter in Japan 's gross domestic product , a broad indicator of what a country produces within its own borders , prompted the normally cautious EPA to predict a `` full-scale recovery '' by the end of the current fiscal year next March .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;2	Private economists remain somewhat more cautious , however , saying the fast pace of expansion may not last and that structural drags on the economy , including mountains of bad debt , may hold Japan 's recovery to a slow pace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;3	EPA Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka told reporters that domestic demand during the quarter grew strongly , helped by a one-year income tax cut that the government implemented in June as well as by Japan 's record summer heat wave .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;4	The EPA , the government 's economic forecasting agency , has so far only tentatively talked about Japan 's economy heading toward recovery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;5	Tanaka 's statements Friday mark a much more bullish assessment than government officials have so far been willing to make .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;6	Tanaka said it 's still difficult to predict how strongly the Japanese economy will grow , noting that the yen 's strength and the pace of growth in capital outlays must both be watched .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;7	The surprising upturn of capital outlays , which account for roughly 20 percent of Japan 's GDP and have been the major drag on the economy in recent years as companies retreated from the heavy investments made during the late 1980s , was seen as a good sign .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;8	But private analysts say it 's doubtful that the strong gains in personal consumption and capital spending seen in the latest quarter can be sustained during the current quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;9	The report definitely points to recovery but `` let 's not get carried away , '' said Mineko Sasaki-Smith , senior economist with Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;10	The scenario of a gradual upturn still remains most likely , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0134;11	The strong growth in the July-September quarter followed a relatively mild 0.2 percent expansion in the April-June quarter , which works out to 0.7 percent growth at an annual pace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0135;0	Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were lower at midday Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0135;1	At noon GMT , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was 3,022.6 , down 17 points .
APW_ENG_19941202.0135;2	Volume was 204.9 million shares .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;0	China 's leaders are united behind an economic plan for 1995 to control the rapidly growing economy and curb runaway inflation , the country 's newspapers reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;1	The leaders announced after a four-day , closed-door national working conference on the economy that reforms would continue with no major changes , the newspapers said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;2	The reports gave no hints of the content of the debates about the extent and timing of reform that were expected at the gathering of top national leaders , provincial chiefs and officials from around the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;3	In recent years , government targets for cooling the economy often have been ignored at the provincial and local levels , where officials want to make the most of growth opportunities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;4	An editorial Friday in the Communist Party newspaper People 's Daily called on party committees and governments at all levels to `` safeguard the authority '' of national economic policies and actually implement them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;5	Slogans such as `` deepen reform , '' `` maintain stability , '' and `` strengthen macro-economic control , '' were typically numerous in news reports in the state-controlled press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;6	But there were no new figures .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;7	The reports did not give any new target for reducing inflation , now running at more than 20 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;8	It was possible that officials did not want to set targets that might not be met , or that they could not agree on new ones .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;9	`` China will continue to strengthen macroeconomic control over the national economy in order to seek a sustainable , rapid and healthy economic development next year , '' the official Xinhua News Agency said in summing up the conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;10	The Xinhua report was spread across the front pages of all major newspapers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;11	The meeting agreed that the major problems were a lack of agricultural development , poor performance of state enterprises , a breakdown of social order and the growing gap between rich industrial areas and poor , rural inland areas , it said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;12	In addition , high inflation for the past two years has aroused concern throughout society , it said , warning that while some inflation during rapid economic growth was unavoidable , too much was dangerous .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;13	China 's leaders already had announced that controlling inflation and reforming failing state enterprises would be top goals for the new year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;14	State-run industries account for about half of China 's industrial output , and just under half of them have been losing money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;15	Concerned about the possibility of social unrest , the government has so far stopped short of massive layoffs or cutting social services tied to state jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;16	Other priorities listed in the latest economic plan included more spending on agriculture to ensure adequate food production .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;17	Strict control of bank credit will be continued .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;18	The People 's Daily editorial predicted an 11 percent growth rate for 1995 , about the same as this year 's .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;19	In a separate report , the Guangming Daily reported Friday a directive from the State Economic and Trade Commission ordering links be severed between all government and party offices and all commercial and business enterprises before the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;20	In recent years , as part of the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented one , many government economic and trade offices have been transformed into companies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;21	But for many of these new companies , the change was in name only .
APW_ENG_19941202.0136;22	They retained the same staff and maintained the same relationships with government and party organs , giving them an edge over competitors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;0	The IRA expects negotiations about weapons with the British to include security force arms as well as it own hidden arsenals , the movement 's political allies signalled Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;1	`` We 're prepared , perfectly prepared , to discuss the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland , both legal and illegal , '' Mitchel McLaughlin , a spokesman for Sinn Fein , said on BBC radio .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;2	Britain and Sinn Fein are to start talks in Belfast on Wednesday , the next big step in the search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland following the 3-month-old cease-fire by the IRA in its battle to end British rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;3	Martin McGuinness , a former IRA commander who will lead the Sinn Fein team , has said for the first time that the future of the IRA weapons , mostly hidden over the border in the Republic of Ireland would be discussed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;4	Michael Mates , a British legislator and former minister sometimes used by the government to argue publicly with Sinn Fein , said the change of heart was `` very good news . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;5	`` Only a month ago Martin McGuinness was saying ` if I asked the IRA to hand over their weapons they 'd laugh ' , '' Mates said on the same program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;6	He maintained that Protestant politicians would not negotiate directly with the Catholic-based Sinn Fein or the IRA `` while behind while behind that organization is still the threat of returning to violence if they do n't get their way . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;7	Sinn Fein 's McLaughlin , however , said the IRA would need evidence of real progress in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0137;8	Only then , he said , would it be `` realistic to go to those who have weapons and say ` we believe the conditions now exist where it would be possible and practical to take the gun out of Irish politics forever . '' '
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;0	Rod McGeoch , who masterminded Sydney 's successful bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games , is to be an adviser to a joint Australia-New Zealand bid to host the rugby union World Cup in 1999 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;1	Australia and New Zealand plan to combine in opposition to England 's bid to host the World Cup , and New Zealand Rugby Football Union president Eddie Tonks already has had talks with his Australian counterparts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;2	`` Australia initially came up with the idea of bidding for the Cup and they decided to get this guy -LRB- McGeoch -RRB- involved , '' Tonks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;3	`` I met him in Sydney recently and he seems a very professional and impressive man .
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;4	`` We 're likely to be guided by him on our presentation to the International Rugby Board . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;5	Bids for the right to host the World Cup have to be placed with the IRB by Dec. 31 and the host country will be decided at the board 's March meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0138;6	McGeoch , a Sydney lawyer , was head of the Sydney 2000 Bid Committee that won the 2000 Olympic Games ahead of Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;0	Russian lawmakers in Chechnya for negotiations with its defiant president on Friday called on Russia to halt its air strikes against the rebel republic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;1	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , a member of parliament and former welfare minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;2	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;3	Other members of the parliamentary delegation also called for an end to the air strikes , warning the conflict could spiral out of control .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;4	Pamfilova spoke while awaiting a meeting with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;5	She is a part of four-person delegation trying to negotiate the release of 70 Russians captured in the fighting in Chechnya , a tiny , mostly Muslim republic in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;6	Dudayev at first threatened to kill the prisoners , whom he identified as Russian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;7	He later said they would be tried in military courts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;8	Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said the captives are mercenaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;9	Dudayev , who declared his fiesty republic 's independence from Russia in 1991 , accuses Moscow of arming and leading the rebels who are now trying to topple him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;10	The rebels began an offensive last week backed by combat aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;11	Thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 , this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;12	Chechen officials said there was another round of air raids early Friday morning east of Grozny , including one on Shali , home to a tank regiment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;13	On Thursday , a small airfield near Grozny was hit in an air raid and four people died in a missile attack at Katayama , about 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- from Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;14	`` We saw two planes fly over this morning , '' the commander of the air field , Biali Chimayev , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;15	`` We 're expecting another attack . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;16	Thursday 's raid destroyed an Mi-8 helicopter and four propeller planes but 11 tanks , including five captured form the opposition survived .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;17	Moscow does not recognize the independence of Chechnya , which became part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;18	Officially , the Kremlin says its support for Dudayev 's opposition is political and financial -- not military .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;19	But President Boris Yeltsin threatened earlier this week to send in troops unless the fighting stopped .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;20	He later softened his stance , but there are media reports of Russian troop buildups near the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;21	`` Chauvinist forces in Russian are pushing President Yeltsin to act , saying he can not control ` little ' Chechnya , '' warned Vladimir Lysenko , another member of the parliamentary delegation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;22	Although ultranationalists , like the flamboyant Vladimir Zhirinovsky , constantly lament the loss of Moscow 's empire , most Russians are ready to let the Chechens go their own way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;23	More than 74 percent of the 3,250 people questioned in a new poll said Russia should recognize Chechnya 's independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0139;24	Only 5.5 percent opposed it and 20.3 percent had no opinion .

APW_ENG_19941202.0140;5	She is a part of four-person delegation trying to negotiate the release of 70 Russians captured in the fighting in Chechnya , a tiny , mostly Muslim republic in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0142;0	The trial of three British soldiers accused of killing a Danish woman bogged down in legal complications Friday , with defense attorneys demanding the case be thrown out on a technicality .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;1	The trial was adjourned until Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;2	There have been a string of adjournments on legal technicalities since the men were arrested Sept. 13 for slaying Louise Jensen , a 23-year-old tour guide from Hirthshals , northern Denmark , after kidnapping her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;3	Friday 's move followed a ruling by the three-judge assize court in this south coast resort city that it was competent to hear arguments on a defense motion for dismissal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;4	The defense claims the confiscation of confidential notes the men had written for their lawyers by a guard in Nicosia 's Central prison , the only one on the east Mediterranean island , was illegal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;5	State prosecutor Petros Clerides asked for time to consult the attorney general and stressed that such a legal point has never been raised in Cyprus before .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;6	That opened the possibility the case will be referred to the Supreme Court , the republic 's highest court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;7	That could delay the trial for weeks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;8	The soldiers are privates Alan Ford , 26 , of Birmingham ; Justin Fowler , 26 , of Falmouth , Cornwall ; and Jeff Parnell , 23 , of Oldbury , West Midlands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;9	The men , making their eighth court appearance Friday , have yet to enter their pleas on charges of manslaughter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;10	The original charge of premeditated murder was reduced last month because the prosecution decided it might not be able to prove the men had planned to kill Jensen before they abducted her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;11	Police said the Britons have admitted kidnapping and killing Jensen in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa Sept. 13 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;12	Her battered body was found in a shallow grave two days later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0142;13	The soldiers were arrested at a police roadblock with bloodstains on their clothes and a blood-covered shovel in their car a few hours after Jensen 's Cypriot boyfriend reported her abduction .

APW_ENG_19941202.0144;6	`` I know how it was before , '' she said in Romanian , translating for Conner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0144;7	Conner , also a gymnast gold medallist , talked about the `` warm and exciting reception '' the couple received , saying the most memorable moment was when he asked Gheorghe Comeneci for his daughter 's hand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0144;8	Five years ago , Nadia Comaneci left Romania in a dramatic escape .
APW_ENG_19941202.0144;9	It was just one month before the collapse of the regime of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu .

APW_ENG_19941202.0146;1	Russia has also proposed that the meeting , slated for Dec. 5-6 , adopt a declaration giving the CSCE the dominant role in ensuring European security , the ITAR-Tass news agency said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0146;2	Russia has tried to dilute the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact created a political and military vacuum in Europe , causing many former Soviet bloc nations to seek closer ties with the NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0146;3	In an effort to meet these demands , NATO approved a Partnership for Peace program to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0146;4	ITAR-Tass said Russia would seek the adoption of a declaration saying , `` the CSCE has always played and will go on playing the key role in ensuring Europe 's security and stability . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0146;5	The proposed document will also say , `` alignments have no real future . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0148;0	The government on Friday expelled two foreign journalists from Indonesia , accusing them of working in the disputed territory of East Timor without proper permits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;1	Irene Slagt , 42 , of the Netherlands , and Jill da Rosemary Jolliffe , 49 , of Australia , entered Dili , the capital of East Timor , on Nov. 28 on tourist visas , a military spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;2	`` They were detained while interviewing some people , '' Maj. Laeden Simbolon , a spokesman of the East Timor Military Command , told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;3	East Timor , a former Portuguese colony annexed by Jakarta in 1976 , is normally closed to journalists , who have to obtain permits from the Information Ministry to report from there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;4	Such permits are rarely given , but an exception was made when Indonesia hosted the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;5	Restrictions were reimposed once the 17 APEC leaders returned home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;6	Indonesia , fighting a pro-independence campaign by guerrillas in East Timor , has often been condemned for reported human rights violations by its troops in the territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;7	Simbolon said the two journalists were detained in the regency of Baucau , 65 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- east of Dili , on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;8	The left Indonesia early Friday , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;9	It was not immediately clear which publications the two women worked for .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;10	Jolliffe is a Lisbon-based journalist who was to accompany a Portuguese parliamentary mission to East Timor in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;11	The trip was called off after Indonesia rejected Jolliffe 's inclusion in the team , accusing her of supporting the East Timor insurgency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;12	The cancellation of the trip sparked a violent demonstration in Dili on Nov. 12 , 1991 , that was quelled when troops opened fire , killing dozens of people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;13	To mark the anniversary of the massacre , thousands of East Timorese rampaged through the streets of Dili on Nov. 13 , looting shops , burning cars and smashing windows .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;14	The expulsion of the journalists coincided with the visit of two United Nations envoys to Dili on Friday in preparation for talks on East Timor between the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal on Jan. 9 in Geneva .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;15	Also , a special envoy of Pope John Paul II reached Dili Thursday for a five-day visit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;16	The Rev. Thomas Michel met with Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares and discussed religious life on the island .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;17	East Timor is the only Roman Catholic region in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia , a country of 185 million people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;18	Indonesian troops moved into East Timor a year after Portugal abandoned the territory it had colonized for four centuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0148;19	However , the United Nations still recognizes Portugal as East Timor 's administering power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;0	Serbs fired missiles at the Bosnian government headquarters Friday in a sign of contempt for senior U.N. officials on a new mission to end harassment of their peacekeeping troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;1	The anti-tank missiles were fired just before the arrival of the top U.N. official for former Yugoslavia , Yasushi Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;2	Akashi , on a mission to end detention of hundreds of peacekeepers and win freedom of movement for U.N. convoys , hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;3	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed trying to meet with the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides in Bosnia might lead to the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;4	Akashi arrived Friday morning in Sarajevo for meetings with Bosnian government officials , and was to continue on to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;5	He left the presidency briefly and the two missiles hit the building just before he returned for meetings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;6	A third missile hit a building nearby .

APW_ENG_19941202.0150;8	On Thursday , Serbs fired two anti-tank missiles at the Interior Ministry , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;9	Akashi 's talks with the Serbs would follow a meeting Thursday between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;10	A U.N. source said Karadzic promised to try to help , but added that such promises often are empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;11	Spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi wanted to discuss fighting around the government enclave of Bihac with Karadzic , as well as an end to restrictions on the movement of U.N. troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;12	Thant said Bihac , scene of heavy fighting for weeks , was quiet overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;13	But strong Serb forces , which have seized 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe zone '' encompassing the town of Bihac and environs , remained in the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;14	The United Nations has said the Serbs , from both Croatia and Bosnia , appeared strong enough to capture Bihac if they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;15	There were signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;16	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;17	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;18	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Croatian Serb forces also had shelled his forces across the border near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;19	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;20	Alexander Ivanko , a U.N. spokesman , said Thursday that Bosnian Serb units in the Bihac area crossed the border into Croatia and seized seven Ukrainian peacekeepers from an observation post Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;21	They took the soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier into Bosnian Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;22	More than 400 of the 24,000 U.N. soldiers in Bosnia are being detained by the Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;23	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;24	The Serbs also have been ignoring U.N. requests to send supply convoys across territory they hold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;25	Monique Tuffelli , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staffer in Bihac , said Thursday that food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;26	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;27	The Serbs repeatedly have rejected an international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;28	With the threat of international force appearing to dissipate , their position is hardening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;29	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , rejected a three-month cease-fire , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;30	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;31	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;32	The peace plan they rejected would give the Serbs 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;33	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0150;34	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;0	A Utah woman and her late husband have been honored by Israel as `` Righteous Gentiles '' for hiding about a dozen Jews from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;1	Uri Oren , the Israeli consul general in Los Angeles , presented Alida Praag with a medal and certificate at the state Capitol on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;2	Mrs. Praag and her husband Tom 's names will be inscribed on the Righteous Honor Wall at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;3	`` My husband and I felt it should be done .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;4	It was our sense of what was right , '' Mrs. Praag said , recalling their hiding of between 12 and 14 Jews during the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;5	Attending the ceremony Thursday was Peter Epstein of Los Angeles , who was a child in wartime Amsterdam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;6	He helped bring the Praags to the attention of the Israeli government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;7	Epstein said his father asked the Praags to take him and his 1-year-old brother , Frank , but they had room only for Frank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;8	The Epsteins decided to keep their family together and they eventually were sent to the Bergen Belsen concentration camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;9	They survived and were liberated by the Russians in May 1945 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;10	`` Fifty-five years ago , a black cloud covered the world , '' Oren said during the ceremony .
APW_ENG_19941202.0151;11	`` But behind every black cloud is a source of light , the righteous among the nations . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;0	Serbs fired missiles at the Bosnian government headquarters Friday in a sign of contempt for senior U.N. officials on a new mission to end harassment of their peacekeeping troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;1	The anti-tank missiles were fired just before the arrival of the top U.N. official for former Yugoslavia , Yasushi Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;2	Akashi , on a mission to end detention of hundreds of peacekeepers and win freedom of movement for U.N. convoys , hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;3	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed trying to meet with the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides in Bosnia might lead to the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;4	Akashi arrived Friday morning in Sarajevo for meetings with Bosnian government officials , and was to continue on to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;5	He left the presidency briefly and the two missiles hit the building just before he returned for meetings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;6	A third missile hit a building nearby .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;7	There were no immediate reports of injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;8	On Thursday , Serbs fired two anti-tank missiles at the Interior Ministry , wounding four people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;9	Akashi 's talks with the Serbs would follow a meeting Thursday between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;10	A U.N. source said Karadzic promised to try to help , but added that such promises often are empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;11	Spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi wanted to discuss fighting around the government enclave of Bihac with Karadzic , as well as an end to restrictions on the movement of U.N. troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;12	Thant said Bihac , scene of heavy fighting for weeks , was quiet overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;13	But strong Serb forces , which have seized 30-40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe zone '' encompassing the town of Bihac and environs , remained in the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;14	The United Nations has said the Serbs , from both Croatia and Bosnia , appeared strong enough to capture Bihac if they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;15	There were signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;16	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;17	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0152;18	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Croatian Serb forces also had shelled his forces across the border near the town of Livno .

APW_ENG_19941202.0153;0	Turkey 's army pressed its crackdown on Kurdish rebel bases in the mountains of the southeast , killing 52 of guerrillas , the regional governor 's office here said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0153;1	The fighting took place over the last few days in Tunceli and Diyarbakir provinces , it added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0153;2	Three soldiers were also killed in the clashes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0153;3	The guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy since 1984 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0153;4	More than 13,000 people have died in the unrest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;0	After races were canceled in three countries , the men 's Alpine skiing World Cup is finally expected to begin Saturday at one of the few places in Europe that has the needed snow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;1	Alberto Tomba ca n't wait .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;2	The three-time Olympic champion has been training on a glacier in Cervinia , Italy , since cancellation earlier this week of a nighttime slalom race in Sestriere .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;3	`` I feel good , in great form .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;4	The most important point at the beginning of the season is to start with the right step , '' Tomba said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;5	`` Thus I want to finish high in the giant slalom . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;6	A giant slalom is scheduled for Saturday , followed by a slalom Sunday on a glacier at Tignes more than 2,600 meters -LRB- 8,500 feet -RRB- above sea level .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;7	After rains canceled the opening races in Saas Fee , Switzerland at the start of November , warm weather and lack of snow has plagued Europe since .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;8	A pair of races in Sestriere were moved to Tignes this weekend , while the opening downhill and super-G set for Val D'Isere , France , on Dec. 3-4 were also wiped out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;9	The two speed races and another downhill scheduled for Val Gardena , Italy , are still looking for a location .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;10	The International Skiing Federation may reach a decision this weekend .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;11	Val D'Isere , with snow cannons operating and hoping for cold weather , has expressed a desire to take over as many races as possible and the federation is eager to accommodate any place that can handle them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;12	Another giant slalom set for Alta Badia , Italy , on Dec. 11 is likely to be canceled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;13	while races in Austria later in December are in jeopardy if snow does not come soon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;14	When the races do start , some old faces will be seeking new titles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;15	One of the favorites is Kjetil-Andre Aamodt of Norway , who won the overall World Cup last year by more than 300 points over five-time champion Marc Girardelli , the Austrian-born skier who competes for Luxembourg .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;16	Aamodt did n't win an Olympic title , but took three medals in Lillehammer last February .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;17	The man who did win gold in the giant slalom at Lillehammer , Germany 's Markus Wasmeier , has retired .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;18	While the men are still waiting to ski , the women are entering their second weekend of racing in North America .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;19	A downhill and super-G are set for Vail , Colo. , after a giant slalom and slalom opened the season in Park City , Utah .
APW_ENG_19941202.0154;20	The United States Ski Association has offered to take over some of the canceled races in Europe but teams are balking at the idea to travel back-and-forth between the two continents for a few days of skiing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;0	A group of Beijing Christians subjected to weeks of government harassment issued an appeal Friday to believers worldwide for prayer and support .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;1	`` We call on brothers and sisters in Christ to pray for us , members of the -LRB- church -RRB- body who have suffered abuse , and to be concerned about how the situation develops , '' said the written appeal given to The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;2	It was signed by six Christians who have been active in recent months in urging their church to defy government attempts to remove their senior pastor , Yang Yudong .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;3	Yang , the aging pastor of Gangwashi church , the most popular in Beijing , has long irritated the government with his pro-democracy views and his attempts to distance himself and his congregation from government supervision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;4	For the second time in two years , the government has had to back down from sacking Yang in the face of opposition from church members , who last year threatened street protests and this year sought international media attention .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;5	The appeal said eight church members have been constantly tailed by plainclothes police since mid-November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;6	On Nov. 23 , one of them , Liu Fenggang , was beaten and kicked in the face and knocked to the ground by plainclothes police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;7	Photos showed his jacket ripped from waist to armpit and his face swollen and bruised .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;8	On the same day , Hua Huiqi , also was attacked by plainclothes police , who insulted his beliefs and said they were singling out Christians to beat up , the appeal said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;9	`` What is the crime in believing in the Lord ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;10	The Nov. 23 incidents were not the first clashes between church members and police and government religious officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;11	In recent months , there have been several scuffles at the church over government attempts to dismiss Yang and over a room in the church compound that the government took over for its own use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;12	Official statistics say there are 7 million to 8 million Christians in China who worship in government-approved churches , but estimates of the number of members of underground churches run from 30 million to 50 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;13	Officially , freedom of religion of religion is protected by China 's constitution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;14	In reality religious believers are frequently subjected to official persecution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;15	Many Catholic clergy , Protestant lay leaders and Tibetan Buddhists have been imprisoned and in some cases have died in prison because of their religious beliefs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;16	The People 's Daily , the Communist Party newspaper , on Friday reminded readers that party members are not supposed to believe in religion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;17	It said that in recent years , growing numbers of party members are turning to religion , which it characterized as a form of superstition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0155;18	It said the phenomenon was the result of slack ideological education .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;0	A lawyer filed a request Friday for the release of 34 Vietnamese `` boat people '' who are unable to return home or find resettlement overseas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;1	Lawyer Pam Baker said some of the Vietnamese have been living in camps in this British colony since the early 1980s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;2	The 34 boat people , who are ethnic Chinese , are not considered Vietnamese nationals by Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;3	Baker said that since the Vietnamese are not able to return to either Vietnam or China , their detention in Hong Kong is illegal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;4	A court hearing on the case is scheduled for Dec. 16 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;5	Two weeks ago , the government released 125 boat people after the human rights group Refugee Concern threatened to take legal action on similar grounds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;6	The Hong Kong government came under severe public criticism after it released those people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;7	Most Hong Kong people want the government to deport all the 24,000 Vietnamese boat people remaining in the colony .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;8	China has also called on the Hong Kong government to resettle the Vietnamese before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0156;9	Refugee Concern said there are about 700 Vietnamese in Hong Kong who are not able to return home because of objections by Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;0	The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on Friday hailed the overwhelming Senate majority for a new trade pact as a `` triumph '' which would help make the world a more prosperous place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;1	`` This is a day for particular celebration , '' GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;2	`` The successful culmination of this debate proved that common sense still works . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;3	The U.S. Senate approved the GATT treaty by 76-24 votes late Thursday -- a much bigger margin than expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;4	The House of Representatives cleared the deal earlier in the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;5	Congressional approval , uncertain for weeks , was deemed crucial to the entry into force of the World Trade Organization Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;6	The new body will implement the new accord and have tougher powers than GATT to settle trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;7	`` I warmly welcome the vote by the U.S. Senate , '' said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , Europe 's chief negotiator in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;8	He said the 12-nation bloc would complete the approval process by Dec. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;9	In Japan , Trade Minister Rytaro Hashimoto said U.S. ratification of the deal would encourage other countries to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;10	Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament passed the accord early Friday and it will now move to the upper house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;11	This view was echoed by Hong Kong 's Director-General of Trade , Tony Miller .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;12	`` The world looks to the United States for leadership in promoting free trade under the multilateral regime , '' Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;13	In Canberra , Austrlian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said the U.S. result was `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;14	Sutherland said he expected about 100 of GATT 's 124 member nations to ratify the trade accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;15	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to free world trade and is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;16	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;17	`` We will have a rules-based system that allows for the development of the world economy and provides an assurance of security , prosperity and reduction of tensions , '' Sutherland said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;18	` I celebrated last night , '' said the Irish lawyer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0157;19	`` It 's a triumph for the organization and the fact that people can react rationally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;0	South Africa 's foreign minister arrived in Taiwan Friday , the first South African minister to visit since Nelson Mandela was sworn in as that country 's president in May .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;1	Alfred Nzo 's three-day visit comes amid continued concern in Taiwan that South Africa might switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing , which supported Mandela 's African National Congress in its fight against apartheid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;2	China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and it insists that countries wanting diplomatic ties break off relations with Taipei .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;3	Taiwan 's Nationalist government fled here in 1949 after losing a civil war to Chinese Communist forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;4	South Africa is one of only 29 countries to defy China 's boycott and maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;5	The newspaper China Times quoted an unidentified official as saying Nzo 's visit indicated that Taiwan-South Africa relations are stable , despite concerns over their diplomatic future .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;6	Nzo will hold talks with President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Lien Chan during his visit , the Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0158;7	Lee attended Mandela 's inauguration in May and offered South Africa U.S. dlrs 70 million in loans to help farmers and to help former anti-apartheid fighters find jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;0	Peter McWhinney shot a 5-under-par round of 67 Friday and joined American Mark Calcavecchia in the lead after the second round of the Greg Norman Holden Classic golf tournament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;1	Calcavecchia shot his second consecutive round of 68 on the par-72 , 6,993-yard Royal Melbourne course and was tied with McWhinney with an 8-under-par total of 136 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;2	The pair held a one-shot lead over Anthony Gilligan , who shot a 66 , while Greg Norman and Brad Faxon were among a group two shots off the pace at 138 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;3	Norman , who has not won a tournament in his homeland for four years , was in hot pursuit of Calcavecchia and McWhinney when an errant drive at the 18th sent him trudging into the bushes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;4	He ended up with a double-bogey seven at the par-5 final hole .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;5	`` I 'm not making any putts and I wish I had the answer , '' Norman said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;6	`` It 's getting frustrating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;7	It just goes through cycles I suppose .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;8	`` One of these days I will eventually make a couple of putts early on and maybe I will shoot a 65 or 66 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;9	I 've just got to take it on the chin and go for it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;10	McWhinney , a laidback Australian who plays most of his golf in Japan , strolled around with virtually no gallery and said he was `` just having a nice walk . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;11	`` It felt like I was not really in a tournament , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;12	Calcavecchia also enjoyed his round in the benign morning conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;13	`` Today was definitely an easier day to play than yesterday , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;14	`` It was beautiful out there , a lot of fun . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0159;15	The tournament continues through Sunday and offers a first prize of U.S. dlrs 115,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;0	Serbs fired missiles at Bosnian government headquarters today in a sign of contempt for senior U.N. officials trying to end harassment of peacekeeping troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;1	The anti-armor missiles landed just before meetings began with the top U.N. official for former Yugoslavia , Yasushi Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;2	Akashi , on a mission to free hundreds of peacekeepers and end restrictions on U.N. relief convoys , was to talk later with the Serbs , who refused to even meet with his boss , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;3	After the rebuff , Boutros-Ghali warned that the intransigence of the warring sides in Bosnia threatened to force the United Nations to end its mission there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;4	The United Nations has pressing issues to discuss : attempts to calm fighting in northwest Bosnia , where Serbs forces have overrun Muslim villages in a U.N.-desigated `` safe area '' ; and the fate of more than 400 U.N. soldiers being held by the Serbs as insurance against NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;5	Akashi arrived this morning in Sarajevo for meetings with officials of the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;6	He left the presidency building briefly before the meetings began and the two missiles hit the structure just before he returned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;7	A third wire-guided anti-armor missile hit a building nearby .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;8	There were no immediate reports of injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;9	After the meetings with the government , Akashi was to head for talks at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , outside Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;10	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met with the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;11	A U.N. source said Karadzic promised to try to help , but added that such promises often are empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;12	Spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi wanted to discuss fighting around the government enclave of Bihac in the northwest , and an end to restrictions on the movement of U.N. troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;13	Thant said Bihac , scene of heavy fighting for weeks , was quiet overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;14	But strong Serb forces , which have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe zone '' encompassing the town of Bihac and its environs , remained in the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;15	The United Nations has said that ethnic Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia appeared strong enough to capture Bihac if they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;16	There were signs that frontlines south of Bihac were also heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;17	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;18	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took the town from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;19	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Croatian Serb forces also had shelled his forces across the border near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;20	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;21	Seven more peacekeepers were seized Tuesday from an observation post in Croatia , across the border from Bihac , a U.N. spokesman said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;22	Bosnian Serb units entered Croatia and took the Ukrainian soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier back into Bosnia , the spokesman , Alexander Ivanko , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;23	More than 400 U.N. soldiers are being detained by the Serbs to deter NATO air raids .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;24	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;25	The Serbs also have been refusing to let U.N. relief convoys pass through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;26	Monique Tuffelli , a staffer with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Bihac , said Thursday that food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;27	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;28	The Serbs repeatedly have rejected an international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;29	With the threat of international force appearing to dissipate , their position is hardening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;30	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , rejected a three-month truce , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;31	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;32	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;33	The peace plan the Serbs rejected would give them 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;34	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0160;35	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;0	Ford Motor Co. and Germany 's Volkswagen AG have agreed to dissolve their joint venture in Brazil and Argentina within a year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;1	The joint venture , called Autolatina , was formed in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;2	It involves engineering , manufacturing and assembly of cars and trucks at plants both companies brought to the partnership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;3	They have maintained independent sales operations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;4	`` When this came into existence in the mid-80s , the economic conditions in both of these countries were extraordinarily difficult -- huge inflation , wage and price controls , '' Ford spokesman Al Chambers said on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;5	`` The two companies thought they could remain in business by taking a defensive position and sharing . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;6	That 's no longer necessary , and both want to return to being competitors , as they are in other nations around the world , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0161;7	Chambers said details of the agreement still must be worked out and that the separation will be gradual .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;0	Indonesia plans to introduce new labor laws providing stiffer penalties for violators and better protection for workers , a senior official said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;1	`` The government is fully aware that the current penalties for violation of labor laws are too lenient , '' said Suwarto , the director general of guidance and control in the Manpower Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;2	He told The Associated Press that a draft of the new laws has been submitted to President Suharto 's office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;3	He did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;4	Although the government has admitted its poor record in labor conditions in the past , little has been done to improve them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;5	Earlier this year the United States threatened to withdraw trade privileges to Indonesia if it did n't improve working conditions and wages for workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;6	The present legislation sets a maximum of three months ' imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 rupiahs -LRB- dlrs 45 -RRB- for employers who do not pay their workers the minimum wage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;7	The government raised the legal minimum wage to 3,800 rupiahs -LRB- dlrs 1.7 -RRB- a day in January this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;8	The new laws will provide more legal protection for workers and guarantee their safety `` so that they will be encouraged to increase productivity , '' Suwarto said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;9	The new laws are to cover the wage system , labor unions , manpower , social insurance , work leave as well as workers ' health , safety and education .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;10	He said 12 of the 95 companies that violated labor laws this year have been prosecuted , most of them either for violating minimum wage regulations or for failure to provide mandatory social insurance , overtime payment , work leave and safe working environments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;11	Their punishments ranged from fines of 75,000 rupiahs -LRB- dlrs 34 -RRB- to 750,000 rupiahs -LRB- dlrs 344 -RRB- or jail terms of three months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0162;12	The remaining 83 companies are expected to be tried soon , said Suwarto .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;0	Greg Norman still believes the World Golf Tour can reach an amicable agreement with the U.S. PGA Tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;1	Norman said Friday that he plans a meeting next week with PGA commissioner Tim Finchem that he hopes will resolve the conflict between the new tour and the PGA .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;2	Norman said he had spoken to Finchem overnight , and had repeated his assurance that he would attempt to work in conjunction with the PGA .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;3	`` They are very keen to keep communications open , '' Norman said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;4	`` He -LRB- Finchem -RRB- asked me to see him when I get home and I will do that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;5	`` Right now the World Tour and the PGA Tour have a chance of working this thing out . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;6	Finchem said Thursday that Norman was re-evaluating his support of the new tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;7	`` Greg and I talked today on the telephone and he indicated he would not support any venture that would damage the PGA Tour , our tournaments or their sponsors , '' Finchem said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;8	`` It was a cordial conversation in which we both agreed that a confrontation would not be in the best interests of the game of golf .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;9	I appreciate Greg 's re-evaluation of this situation . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;10	Norman is playing in the Holden Classic at Royal Melbourne and will return to his home in Florida next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;11	Several top golfers , including No. 1-ranked Nick Price , have expressed interest in joining the world tour , but Norman was the only one so far to actually commit to playing in it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;12	Earlier this week , Finchem rejected the world tour 's offer to cooperate in any way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;13	He also warned PGA members he would use suspensions and any other means at his disposal to force golfers to choose one tour or the other .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;14	Fox Sports spokesman Vince Wladika said the network was still interested in broadcasting the eight proposed tournaments if the world tour went forward as planned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;15	As proposed , the new tour would include several of the top 30 players in the world rankings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0163;16	The prize money would provide dlrs 1 million for player of the year ; dlrs 600,000 to each tournament winner ; and dlrs 30,000 to the last-place finisher , as well as dlrs 50,000 to each golfer for expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;0	A double-century stand between Sachin Tendulkar and skipper Mohammad Azharuddhin helped India pile up 546 for nine before declaring the first innings closed Friday on the second day of the test cricket against the West Indies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;1	The visitors , already 0-1 in the three-match series , are widely seen as having little hope of winning the test .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;2	Just before the game closed at dusk , the West Indies were 15 for 1 , with Stuart Williams back in the stands after scoring 12 runs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;3	Phil Simmons -LRB- 1 -RRB- and night watchman Anderson Cummins -LRB- 0 -RRB- will now need to help their team notch up 332 runs to avoid a follow-on .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;4	Since morning , the Indian team scored swiftly and added to the overnight score of 230 for four .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;5	Tendulkar bludgeoned the ball and made a superb 179 , his career-best and eighth century in 34 tests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;6	He cracked 24 fours -- and a sixer off skipper Courtney Walsh -- before he was caught by Brian Lara at square leg .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;7	Azharuddhin , who showed glimpses of his brilliant style , gently stroked his way to 97 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;8	During the three hours he was at the crease , he knocked 15 fours .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;9	Anil Kumble -LRB- 52 -RRB- and Nayan Mongia -LRB- 44 -RRB- helped India push past the 500 mark against the Caribbeans , the fourth time they have done so against the visitors in 64 tests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0164;10	Carl Hooper , who took five wickets for 116 , was the most successful West Indian bowler .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;0	Swedish divers on Friday planned to survey the wreck of the sunken ferry Estonia , a Baltic Sea tomb for an estimated 800 victims of the tragedy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;1	The divers , making the first human surveillance of the wreck , intend to scrutizine the condition of the ship , which is resting on its side in 56-84 meters -LRB- 180-280 feet -RRB- of water off Finland 's southwestern coast , the news agency TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;2	`` The weather conditions are good .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;3	The weather wo n't hinder the work , '' Swedish maritime administration spokesman Lars-Goeran Bronow told TT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;4	The divers are to gather evidence to help authorities decide the feasibility of retreiving the bodies or taking some other action to preserve them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;5	More than 800 bodies are believed entombed in the wreck , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;6	According to the latest official count , 136 people survived and 913 died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;7	Only 94 bodies have bee recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;8	Swedish authorities were focusing on three options , none of which included raising the entire wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;9	Divers could scour the wreck to retreive the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;10	The last alternative would be leaving all the bodies and filling the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;11	The divers are using a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;12	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed due to poor conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0166;13	The Swedish government , meanwhile , said Friday it has decided to give 3 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 417,000 -RRB- to organizations helping victims ' families , in many cases including orphans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;0	The passage of a world trade pact by the U.S. Congress is a `` triumph '' that will help make the world a more prosperous place , the head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;1	`` This is a day for particular celebration , '' GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;2	`` The successful culmination of this debate proved that common sense still works . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;3	The U.S. Senate approved the GATT treaty by 76-24 votes late Thursday -- a much bigger margin than expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;4	The House of Representatives cleared the deal earlier in the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;5	Congressional approval , uncertain for weeks , was deemed crucial for the the World Trade Organization to take effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;6	The WTO will implement the new accord and have more powers than GATT to settle trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;7	`` I warmly welcome the vote by the U.S. Senate , '' said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , Europe 's chief negotiator in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;8	He said the 12-nation bloc would complete the approval process by Dec. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;9	In Japan , Trade Minister Rytaro Hashimoto said U.S. ratification of the deal would encourage other countries to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;10	Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament passed the accord early Friday and it will now move to the upper house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;11	This view was echoed by Hong Kong 's Director-General of Trade , Tony Miller .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;12	`` The world looks to the United States for leadership in promoting free trade under the multilateral regime , '' Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;13	In Canberra , Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said the U.S. result was `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;14	Sutherland said he expected about 100 of GATT 's 124 member nations to ratify the trade accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;15	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to knock down barriers to free world trade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;16	The pact is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;17	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0167;18	`` We will have a rules-based system that allows for the development of the world economy and provides an assurance of security , prosperity and reduction of tensions , '' Sutherland said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;0	Police arrested 11,000 people headed toward Bhopal Friday for a demonstration marking the 10th anniversary of the world 's worst industrial accident , organizers said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;1	The people were taken off trains at stations outside Bhopal in central India and charged with traveling without tickets -- a common practice in India usually punishable by a fine or a few hours in jail .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;2	`` Shame on you , government , '' said Abdul Jabbar Khan , of the Gas Victims Organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;3	On Dec. 2 , 1984 , a cloud of toxic chemicals leaked from a pesticide plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp.
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;4	About 4,000 people died that night , and 3,000 more deaths were later attributed to the effects of the gas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;5	A half-million people are still seeking compensation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;6	Chief Minister Digvijay Singh , chief executive of Madhya Pradesh state , acknowledged that many people were arrested on trains heading toward the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;7	But Singh could not confirm the number arrested and said he was not sure the arrests were related to the anniversary rally .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;8	Tens of thousands of people travel without tickets on Indian railroads every day , but few are caught and arrested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;9	Khan led a march of 3,000 people from a city park to a square near the state legislature today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;10	Police barricaded the roads and red police vans patrolled the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;11	The city administration banned the protesters from assembling around the legislature .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;12	Khan said his group planned a bigger demonstration Saturday and called for a one-day strike in the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;13	He said his main demand was clearing the logjam that has blocked compensation for the victims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0168;14	Bhopal is located 740 kilometers -LRB- 460 miles -RRB- south of New Delhi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;0	Melissa Selosia , one of the survivors of a ferry that sank Friday in Manila Bay , killing at least 34 people , escaped by remembering her seaman husband 's advice on what to do in an accident at sea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;1	The ferry Cebu City sank quickly after colliding in Manila Bay with a large freighter , the Singapore-registered Kota Suria , barely two hours after setting out for the southern Philippines before dawn .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;2	At least 451 of the ferry 's approximately 600 passengers and crew members survived .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;3	`` I was jolted by the crash and I woke up , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;4	`` Immediately , I grabbed a life jacket and made for the upper deck and then I jumped into the water . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;5	`` I remembered what my husband told me -- to swim away from a sinking boat or else I would be sucked in by the water as it goes down . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;6	She wept in a tearful reunion with her husband , her sister and a brother at coast guard headquarters in Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;7	They had heard radio reports of the accident just hours after they sent her off at Manila harbor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;8	Mrs. Selosia was on her way to Ozamis City on Mindanao Island , 775 kilometers -LRB- 485 miles -RRB- south of Manila , to join her four children for Christmas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;9	Her husband , Presencio , was to leave for Japan on Dec. 10 for ship duty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;10	Erwin Maravilla , one of the first survivors plucked from the sea by a navy patrol , was less fortunate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;11	His wife and two children were missing after they were sucked underwater as the ship slipped into the dark sea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;12	`` A piece of metal hit my arm and I lost hold of my children , '' Maravilla said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;13	Most of the survivors clambered onto the Kota Suria while it remained next to the ferry as it was listing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;14	The survivors said the Cebu City remained afloat for about 15 minutes before it rolled to the left and sank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;15	Many of the passengers from the lower decks were bathed in oil that gushed out of the engine room .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;16	`` It was every man for himself , '' said Danny Dalugdog , a 24-year-old driver and bodyguard for a job recruiter in Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;17	In the confusion , he said he was separated from his wife , Liza , and his 3-month-old baby , Dennis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;18	`` I thought they were gone , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;19	But he found his wife on the freighter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;20	Then , as they transferred to a coast guard ship to return to Manila , a passenger called out that he found a baby boy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0170;21	`` It turned out to be my son , '' Dalugdog said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;0	Congressional clearance of a new world trade accord is expected to encourage ratification by other countries , enabling the mammoth export-boosting pact to enter into force as planned Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;1	Around the world , big and small nations alike are trying to rush the 22,000 page GATT agreement through national parliaments , often in low-key processes that contrast with the rocky ride through the U.S. legislature .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;2	Nearly 40 countries , including the United States and most of southeast Asia , have ratified the 124-nation pact .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;3	About 40 more -- including trade giants Japan , the European Union and Canada -- have indicated they will do so by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;4	Four countries -- Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Cyprus and Poland -- have already told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that domestic politics will prevent them from ratifying the accord this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;5	But this wo n't stop the pact from taking effect as scheduled on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;6	All that is needed is for the all the big traders to come on board as founding members of the World Trade Organization -- GATT 's more powerful successor body that implement the accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;7	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to liberalize world trade and is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;8	Most governments object to at least some provisions because previously protected industries -- such as agriculture in Europe and textiles in the United States -- will suffer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;9	But all participating countries agreed not to upset the carefully crafted compromises with amendments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;10	The ratification situation in some of the main trading nations is as follows : -- European Union : Britain , Ireland , Greece , Germany amd Luxembourg have approved it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;11	The seven other EU members are meant to do so before foreign ministers meet Dec. 19-20 to approve the deal on behalf of the entire trade bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;12	France and Portugal still have some qualms , but the EU Commission , the union 's executive body , said there are no real obstacles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;13	An internal dispute between the Commission and member states over negotiating powers , which slowed national ratification , has been settled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;14	-- Japan : Japan 's powerful lower house has approved the deal , and passage through the upper house is virtually certain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;15	The government placated rice farmers , upset at potential competition from imports , with a six-year , 7.2 trillion yen -LRB- dlrs 74 billion -RRB- compensation package .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;16	-- South Korea : The ruling Democratic Liberal party , which has a big majority , plans to push the accord through the national assembly next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;17	Opposition politicians and farmers accuse the government of making too many concessions under U.S. pressure to open the rice market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;18	There have been frequent violent demonstrations against the accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;19	-- India : There was strong opposition from both left - and right-wing parties , especially to provisions that give foreign multinationals stronger patent claims to Indian seeds and medicines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;20	The opposition , however , seems to have run out of steam and legislative passage appears more or less certain , though no date has been set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;21	-- Canada : Hopes to ratify the accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;22	-- Mexico : Under former President Salinas de Gortari , who is one of three candidates for the directorship of the WTO , Mexico was one of the first countries to ratify the trade accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;23	-- South America : Chile has ratified the accord and Argentina hopes to do so before the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;24	In Brazil , parliamentary passage is likely to be in February , not because the accord is contested but because of delays caused by this year 's election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;25	-- China : In order to join the WTO , Beijing first has to enter GATT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0172;26	Western concerns about China 's market reform programs and a possible flood of Chinese exports mean GATT membership talks are unlikely to finish by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;0	A British aid worker in Rwanda who hid in the jungle for five days after his convoy ran into Zairean gunfire said Friday relief agencies needed better protection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;1	Don Reid , speaking to reporters at London 's Heathrow Airport , said he was driving in a six-truck convoy run by two charities , ActionAid and Assist , when they were stopped at a checkpoint near the Rutshuru refugee camp in Zaire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;2	`` The next thing I knew was there were two Zairean soldiers on the inside of my truck , '' said Reid , 43 , a former soldier in the British army .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;3	`` Immediately , in a second , they started firing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;4	All hell broke loose ... I got out of the truck and just ran like hell . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;5	He said the atmosphere in the camps before the shooting was particularly tense with rumors that a Zairean businessman had been robbed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;6	ActionAid said it would have to withdraw without better protection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;7	`` For weeks now we have been warning the British government and the Foreign Office that something like this was going to happen , '' said the charity 's international director , Nigel Twosee .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;8	Reid said `` there should be some sort of protection for people on the ground . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;9	Reid was found by other other aid workers about 10 miles -LRB- 15 kms -RRB- from where he disappeared .
APW_ENG_19941202.0173;10	On Wednesday , U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposed a 5,000-strong security force to police the refugee camps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;0	Japan 's economy grew at a healthy 3.7 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter , the government announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;1	It was the latest sign that the world 's second-largest economy may be getting back on track .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;2	The 0.9 percent quarter-to-quarter growth in Japan 's gross domestic product , a broad indicator of what a country produces within its own borders , prompted the government 's Economic Planning Agency to predict a `` full-scale recovery '' by the end of the current fiscal year next March .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;3	Private economists remained somewhat more cautious , however , saying the fast pace of expansion may not last and that structural drags on the economy , including mountains of bad debt , may hold Japan 's recovery to a slow pace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;4	Still , positive signs have been spreading .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;5	Despite the record-high yen , many export-related companies , including electronics giants , have been reporting higher earnings for the first half of the fiscal year through September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;6	Also , a survey of 200 top firms released Friday by Japan 's leading economic newspaper , the Nikkei , predicted a 4.3 percent uptick in pretax profits at those firms for the current fiscal year , followed by an 18.1 percent increase in the next fiscal year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;7	But in another sign that the recovery may remain modest , the survey also showed that even after those two years of higher profits , earnings will still be just 60 percent of their peak in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;8	EPA Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka told reporters that consumer spending grew strongly during the latest quarter , thanks to a one-year income tax cut this June as well as a summer heat wave .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;9	The record heat triggered a surge in spending on everything from beer to beach wear .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;10	Tanaka said it 's still difficult to predict how strongly the Japanese economy will grow , noting that the yen 's strength and the pace of growth in spending by companies , known as capital outlays , must both be watched .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;11	The strong growth in the July-September quarter followed a relatively mild 0.2 percent expansion in the April-June quarter , which works out to 0.7 percent growth at an annual pace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;12	The surprising 0.5 percent upturn in capital outlays was seen as a particularly good sign .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;13	It was the first quarter-on-quarter growth in three years in corporate investment in plant and equipment , which accounts for roughly 20 percent of GDP .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;14	Such spending but has been depressed in recent years as companies retreated from the heavy investments made during the late 1980s , putting a drag on economic growth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;15	But private analysts say it 's doubtful that the strong gains in consumer and corporate spending can be sustained during the current quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;16	The report definitely points to recovery , but `` let 's not get carried away , '' said Mineko Sasaki-Smith , senior economist with Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;17	The scenario of a gradual upturn still remains most likely , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;18	Another positive sign has been the steady improvement in business sentiment this year as measured in the closely watched `` tankan , '' a quarterly report issued by the central bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;19	Many analysts are expecting another improvement in sentiment in the report due out Dec. 9 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0174;20	Pessimism continues to outweigh optimism , but the gap between them has been narrowing since March , when sentiment improved for the first time in 41\/2 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;1	But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev maintained for a second day his strong opposition to a NATO plan for drawing up conditions for adding new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;2	He told a joint meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not develop close ties with the alliance until it spelled out its expansion plans , alliances sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether the Western military alliance had changed from its Cold War days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;4	On Thursday , the Russian stunned NATO ministers by his last-minute refusal to agree to a special cooperation program with the alliance to protest the decision to prepare for a future expansion to the East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;5	NATO ministers sought to play down Kozyrev 's outburst .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;6	`` We should n't make too much of yesterday 's events , '' U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told CBS ' `` This Morning '' program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;7	`` -LRB- The -RRB- Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did ... I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;8	Christopher met separately with Kozyrev for more than an hour Friday to discuss the dispute as well as the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;9	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;10	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;11	Willy Claes , secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the formal session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;12	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;13	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the two-day meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;14	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;15	`` The Russians have their internal situation ... This is all a little bit more complicated , '' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;16	Other East European nations welcomed the NATO decision to start the process that could lead to them joining the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;17	`` This is an important milestone on the road to an undivided Europe , '' said Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;18	He said NATO and former communist states should work to overcome Russian `` misinterpretation '' of NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;19	`` We do n't see -LRB- NATO -RRB- as a war machine , so we do n't see how anyone could be concerned , '' Olechowski told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;20	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;21	The Russian outburst pushed , at least temporarily , the crisis in Bosnia off the ministers ' agenda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;22	Christopher , Hurd , Kinkel and Kozyrev were meeting later in the day with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to try to revive the peace process in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;23	Christopher wants formal approval from the others for a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;24	It calls for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities throughout the country for three to six months and then an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;25	The lure for the Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , is an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;26	Juppe and Hurd may fly to Belgrade this weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;27	The NATO allies , in trying to meet East Europeans demands for membership without upsetting a militarily powerful Russia , thought they had found a good formula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;28	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , to bring former foes closer , but without membership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;29	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;30	On Thursday , the allies decided to go further by ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;31	To overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , NATO had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;32	But Kozyrev was n't impressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0176;33	`` If the strategy of NATO has changed , then that is something which requires further discussion , '' Kozyrev told grim-faced NATO ministers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;0	Activists called Friday for an end to violence against women in Asia , which they said ranges from harassment in the workplace to forced prostitution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;1	More than 100 people -- most of them Asian -- made the call at the end of a two-day Asian Women 's Tribunal aimed at promoting the human rights of a gender often discriminated against in this largely male-dominated region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;2	`` It is very easy for a Thai soldier or a Thai policeman to rape a woman , '' said Nimalka Fernando of Sri Lanka , the human rights coordinator of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women , Law and Development .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;3	`` So long as people have the attitude that women are seen as the property of men , violence will continue , '' added Salbiah Ahmad of Nepal , a member of the same group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;4	The meeting issued a declaration painting a grim picture of the treatment of women in Asia , with reports of migrant workers in a number of countries being sexually abused and Indonesian women being forced to undergo inspections to claim the menstrual leave provided them by law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;5	Indian Clarence J. Dias , of the International Center for Law in Development , said violence results from the insecurity of men and the pervasiveness of violence on television shows .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;6	`` Everywhere , people are getting the message , ` You are weak if you do n't use violence , ' '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;7	The meeting called for the criminalization of all acts leading to the sexual slavery of women , holding governments accountable for their failure to protect the human rights of women , and the development of social safety nets to protect the human rights of women .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;8	`` Some violence will always be there , '' Dias added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0177;9	`` But hopefully it will change from the violence of the oppressor to the violence of the oppressed when women begin to fight back and begin to say that this must end . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;0	An SS concentration camp commander serving a life term for killing 650 Jewish slave laborers was indicted Friday on 144 new charges of murder and abetting murder .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;1	Josef Schwammberger , 82 , who sicked his dog on inmates and shot a rabbi for refusing to work on a Jewish holiday , was sentenced in May 1992 in the last major Nazi trial in Germany .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;2	Prosecutor Kurt Schrimm said the new indictment stemmed from evidence that had surfaced since Schwammberger 's earlier trial , and included mass executions and the the murder of individual prisoners by Schwammberger himself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;3	During the earlier trial , Schwammberger admitted running the forced labor camps of Rozwadow , Mielec and Przemysl , all in Poland , between 1942 and 1944 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;4	But he denied killing anyone and said he could n't remember many of the events that were discussed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;5	Despite Schwammberger 's age , Schrimm said , the court has the duty to punish him for every crime it can prove .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;6	Austrian-born Schwammberger fled to Argentina in 1948 , and was extradited in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0179;7	Earlier this year , Simon Wiesenthal , the Austrian Nazi-hunter , said that with the apparent death of SS commander Alois Brunner in Syria in 1992 , it was unlikely any other major Nazis would be captured or prosecuted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;0	A 13-year-old Japanese boy hanged himself in his back yard after being bullied by classmates into giving them more than 1 million yen -LRB- dlrs 10,000 -RRB- over three years , reports said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;1	In a four-page suicide note , Kiyoteru Okouchi said a group of four classmates at Tobu Junior High School had been abusing him and extorting money from him for three years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;2	His body was found Sunday night hanging from a tree at his home in Nishio , about 270 kilometers -LRB- 170 miles -RRB- west of Tokyo , local police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;3	Police would not say how much money Okouchi handed over after the other students repeatedly hit him and dunked his head in a river , but news reports said the total came to 1.1 million yen -LRB- dlrs 11,000 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;4	He took the money from his parents ' house without permission and left a note addressed to his mother acknowledging the debt , Kyodo News Service said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;5	In a section of the note read on an evening news program , Okouchi detailed the way his classmates beat him and forced him to give them money , and said his happiest times were at home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;6	`` To my family , thank you so much , '' he wrote .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;7	`` I 'm going away now . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;8	Bullying remains frequent at Japan 's regimented schools .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;9	Typical targets are children with outstanding grades , physical handicaps , foreign upbringing , or who otherwise do n't conform .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;10	Some students choose suicide rather than continue to face bullying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;11	Last year , 113 students between the ages of 10 and 19 committed suicide for school-related problems such as bullying and severe punishments from teachers , according to a National Police Agency report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;12	About the same amount was reported in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;13	A total of 23,258 cases of bullying were reported in public schools in 1992 , up from 22,062 cases reported in 1991 , according to the most recent figures available from the Education Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;14	`` For him , suicide was no doubt the most severe form of retaliation possible , '' said Susumu Abe , a noted critic on educational issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;15	`` Japanese children are not given enough instruction about the constraints they should put on their actions toward others . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0180;16	In Japan , children under age of 16 do not face criminal prosecution and are tried only in family courts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0181;0	An SS concentration camp commander serving a life term for killing 650 Jewish slave laborers was indicted Friday on 144 new charges of murder and abetting murder .

APW_ENG_19941202.0182;0	Lebanon 's prime minister , once hailed as a savior for a country ravaged by 15 years of civil war , has threatened to resign following charges of government corruption and union demands for pay raises .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;1	Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told the president during a stormy Cabinet meeting Thursday night that he was quitting after more than two years in office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;2	He planned to sumbit a letter of resignation later Friday , aides said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;3	Hariri , a 51-year-old billionaire , has long been frustrated by opposition to his economic and reconstruction policies by several Cabinet ministers allied with neighboring Syria , the undisputed power in Lebanon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;4	His resignation would be a severe setback to efforts to rebuild Lebanon from the destruction of the 1975-90 civil war , which killed 150,000 people , maimed tens of thousands and caused an estimated dlrs 25 billion in damage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;5	During the night , Syrian and Lebanese officials to talk Hariri out of resigning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;6	President Elias Hrawi asked him to stay on in the national interest , Press Syndicate head Mohammed Baalbaki said after meeting the president Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;7	The crisis erupted after the government on Thursday night decreed a 20 percent pay raise for workers , which was promptly rejected by the General Federation of Labor Unions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;8	The federation , which represents 350,000 workers , insists on an 80 percent hike to keep pace with rampant inflation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;9	The unions staged a one-day warning strike Tuesday to press their demands and threatened to escalate their protests Dec. 5 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;10	The government has also been beset by corruption allegations , which prompted a heated exchange during Thursday night 's Cabinet session .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;11	Housing Minister Mahmoud Abu Hamdan claimed Hariri , who has a fortune estimated at dlrs 3 billion , would benefit from a real estate deal in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;12	Hariri got angry , said he was quitting and stormed out of the Cabinet room , pursued by Hrawi and several ministers trying to talk him out of it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;13	Hariri was appointed prime minister Oct. 22 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;14	Many welcomed his ascent to power as a harbinger of Lebanon 's return to regional prominence as a financial and trading hub .
APW_ENG_19941202.0182;15	But corruption charges have dogged his two-year tenure and his high-handed style has angered opponents .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;0	Swedish divers on Friday planned to survey the wreck of the sunken ferry Estonia , a Baltic Sea tomb for an estimated 800 victims of the tragedy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;1	The divers , making the first human surveillance of the wreck , intend to scrutizine the condition of the ship , which is resting on its side in 56-84 meters -LRB- 180-280 feet -RRB- of water off Finland 's southwestern coast , the news agency TT reported .

APW_ENG_19941202.0183;4	The divers were to gather evidence to help authorities decide the feasibility of retrieving the bodies or taking some other action to preserve them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;5	More than 800 bodies are believed entombed in the wreck , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;6	Of the estimated 1,049 on the ferry when it sank , 137 survived , according to official figures published Friday by the Finnish police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;7	Only 94 bodies have been recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;8	Swedish authorities were focusing on three options , none of which included raising the entire wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;9	Divers could scour the wreck to retrieve the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;10	The last alternative would be leaving all the bodies and filling the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;11	The divers are using a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;12	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed due to poor conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0183;13	The Swedish government , meanwhile , said Friday it has decided to give 3 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 417,000 -RRB- to organizations helping victims ' families , in many cases including orphans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;0	Engineers striking for higher pay forced the state-run RENFE railway to cancell at least half the trains on most routes Friday in the first of several walk-offs planned for December , RENFE officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;1	National routes were limited to one train per day while the more frequent suburban and regional train service was cut by between 50 and 75 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;2	Further one day strikes are called for the 11th , 22nd , 23rd and 30th of December .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;3	The engineers ' union is demanding a 20 percent wage hike from RENFE , the loss-making public sector railway undergoing permanent restructuring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;4	RENFE said the strike was peaceful but police in Madrid removed picketers who tried to prevent the departure of a Seville-bound high-speed train .
APW_ENG_19941202.0184;5	The railway called on strikers to return to join in negotiations over a labor agreement intended to cover all of RENFE 's workforce .

APW_ENG_19941202.0186;0	Roman Catholic authorities have reached an out of court settlement with a man who was sexually molested by a priest when he was an altar boy , news reports said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;1	The report was the latest in a rash of sexual abuse cases involving priests in this 97 percent Catholic country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;2	Church officials and Padraic Ferry , a Dublin attorney who was understood to be involved in the settlement negotiations , refused to comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;3	The Connacht Tribune , published in Galway in western Ireland , said the settlement was more than 75,000 Irish pounds -LRB- dlrs 107,250 -RRB- and that the victim , now in his twenties , was 11 years old when he was first assaulted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;4	The Irish Times of Dublin said the payment was the responsibility of the local bishop .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;5	The Connacht Tribune said the priest had been convicted of sexual assault in 1993 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison , with the final five years suspended if he entered a rehabilitation program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;6	The judge issued an order forbidding identification of the parish and diocese involved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;7	The Irish Independent of Dublin reported that the victim served the priest as an altar boy , and that one of the assaults took place on a pilgrimage to Lourdes , France in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;8	Cardinal Cahal Daly , the primate of Ireland 's Catholic Church , said in a radio interview on Tuesday that his church had been `` humbled '' by the sexual scandals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;9	Daly said more cases would surface , `` because we are dealing now with cases going back 10 , maybe 15 , 20 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;10	But they should be reported and they should be dealt with . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;11	The case of the Rev. Brendan Smyth , 67 , who was convicted 17 counts of indecently assaulting five girls and two boys in Belfast , precipitated the collapse of Ireland 's coalition government last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;12	The Labor Party , junior partner in the coalition , was angered by the attorney general 's inaction on an application for the priest 's extradition to Northern Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;13	Police are investigating allegations that a priest now living in the Irish republic molested a girl in Londonderry , Northern Ireland , five years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;14	The Irish Times reported Tuesday that police are also investigating allegations that a religious brother sexually abused a 50-year-old mentally ill woman at a home in County Cork in southern Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0186;15	Besides Smyth , four other Catholic clerics appeared in court this year on molestation charges : a Galway priest and former school principal who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old male hitchhiker ; a Servite brother from Northern Ireland who admitted molesting three 11-year-old girls ; a Belfast priest charged with molesting nine boys aged 9 to 15 ; a brother appealing his 18-year sentence for raping six schoolboys in western Ireland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;0	Searchers recovered 34 bodies from a ferry that sank before dawn Friday with more than 600 people on board after colliding with a Singapore-registered freighter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;1	Frogmen said more bodies were trapped inside the ship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;2	Lt. Comdr. Amado Samante , the coast guard spokesman , said at least 451 people on the 2,452-ton Cebu City survived the collision with the 12,500-ton Kota Suria , which is five times bigger , as the ferry was about to sail out of Manila Bay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;3	The search for the remaining passengers was called off late in the day because of darkness and was to resume Saturday morning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;4	`` There were more bodies inside the cabins , '' said Seaman Angel Espidido , one of 27 coast guard divers who joined navy frogmen in recovering bodies trapped inside the ferry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;5	Espidido said he could see the bodies through portholes but the divers were unable to open the doors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;6	`` Tomorrow we will go back to unlock them , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;7	Seaman Hermogenes Guilaran said he recovered the bodies of two elderly women and a boy who were trapped at a railing on the side of the ferry which was lying under 90 feet -LRB- 27 meters -RRB- of water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;8	William Lines , the ferry operator , said the ship was carrying 608 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;9	There was no immediate official report on the cause of the accident , but the ferry 's owner claimed it had been rammed by the Kota Suria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;10	Eugene Espedido , a vice president of the company , said it was preparing a request for the coast guard to detain the freighter and its crew .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;11	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the Kota Suria 's bow crashed into the Cebu City , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;12	He said ship captain Wesceslao Lampong and several other officers were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;13	The Kota Suria , with a crew of 30 , had its bow badly dented but joined the rescue effort , plucking 230 of those saved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;14	President Fidel Ramos ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;15	Samante said about 50 coast guard , navy and commercial sea vessels were involved in the search effort .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;16	William Lines said the Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;17	It sank near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;18	It had left the port of Manila bound for Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;19	Quirimon Tan , William Lines vice president , said each of the dead passengers was covered by 50,000 pesos -LRB- dlrs 2,173 -RRB- in insurance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;20	He said the company would also pay for medical and funeral expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;21	In a quirk of timing , the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved William Lines ' initial public stock offering .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;22	The company is selling 235 million shares for between 9.65 pesos -LRB- 41 U.S. cents -RRB- and 15.15 pesos -LRB- 65 cents -RRB- a share .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;23	An analyst who asked not to be named said the accident would probably not drag down the stock issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0187;24	The Philippines ' worst peacetime ferry disaster was in December 1987 , when 4,341 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;0	Swedish divers on Friday planned to survey the wreck of the sunken ferry Estonia , a Baltic Sea tomb for an estimated 800 victims of the tragedy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;1	The divers , making the first human surveillance of the wreck , intend to scrutizine the condition of the ship , which is resting on its side in 56-84 meters -LRB- 180-280 feet -RRB- of water off Finland 's southwestern coast , the news agency TT reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;2	`` The weather conditions are good .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;3	The weather wo n't hinder the work , '' Swedish maritime administration spokesman Lars-Goran Bronow told TT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;4	The divers were to gather evidence to help authorities decide the feasibility of retrieving the bodies or taking some other action to preserve them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;5	More than 800 bodies are believed entombed in the wreck , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;6	Of the estimated 1,049 on the ferry when it sank , 137 survived , according to official figures published Friday by the Finnish police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;7	Only 94 bodies have been recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;8	Swedish authorities were focusing on three options , none of which included raising the entire wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;9	Divers could scour the wreck to retrieve the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;10	The last alternative would be leaving all the bodies and filling the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;11	The divers are using a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;12	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed due to poor conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0189;13	The Swedish government , meanwhile , said Friday it has decided to give 3 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 417,000 -RRB- to organizations helping victims ' families , in many cases including orphans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;0	Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Warren of the Seattle Seahawks was arrested after a car he was driving crashed into a utility pole , injuring him and two teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;1	One player was critically hurt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;2	Warren , 27 , the fourth-leading rusher in the U.S. National Football League this season ; rookie running back Lamar Smith , 24 ; and a third player who was not unidentified pending notification of his parents , were taken to Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;3	The unidentified player sustained a severe neck injury and was listed in critical condition early Friday , said team orthopedic surgeon Pierce Scranton .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;4	He refused to discuss whether the player was paralyzed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;5	Warren , who sustained two cracked ribs , was treated and released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;6	Smith had a chip fracture in his spine and ankle and was hospitalized overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;7	Warren , driving a Chevy Blazer -- a small truck-like vehicle , was arrested at the scene for investigation of vehicular assault , Sgt. Mark Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;8	Smith said it appeared Warren was driving too fast for the rainslicked roads .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;9	The crash set the utility pole on fire and the players had to be pulled from the vehicle by passersby , Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;10	Police would not comment on whether drugs or alcohol were involved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;11	Warren was released on his own personal recognizance , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;12	The accident happened about 8:40 p.m. Thursday night near the team 's training center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;13	`` You read about it , you hear about it , but when it happens to somebody very close it really is a shock , '' Seahawks coach Tom Flores told KIRO-AM early today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;14	`` It 's something that we all have to keep praying for that they all recover . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;15	The power line suspended on the pole was severed in the collision , causing a large electrical flash and disabling three sub-stations , said Puget Power spokesperson Kristen Wappler .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;16	The accident knocked out electricity to some 4,500 Puget Power customers for about an hour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;17	Warren , a fifth-year , Pro Bowl running back from Ferrum College in Virginia , is the first Seahawks player to rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;18	He started this week as the second leading rusher in the American conference with 1,096 yards , just 5 yards behind San Diego 's Natrone Means .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;19	He also is second in the AFC in total yards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;20	Smith , drafted in the third round from Houston , has been active for two games .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;21	He has carried twice for a net 1-yard loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;22	The Seahawks play Indianapolis Sunday in the Kingdome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;23	The accident was the latest in a number of auto accidents involving NFL players this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;24	Dallas offensive lineman Erik Williams was lost for the season when he tore knee ligaments in an Oct. 24 crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;25	Williams pleaded no contest to drunken driving .
APW_ENG_19941202.0190;26	Teammate Shante Carver , a defensive end , also was involved in an accident in October when his speeding truck crashed into a concrete retaining wall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0191;0	Japan agreed Friday to extend to 1997 Russia 's repayment of dlrs 100 million owned by the former Soviet Union to Japan 's Export-Import Bank , the Foreign Ministry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0191;1	Notes concerning the agreement were exchanged in Tokyo , the ministry announced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0191;2	Earlier this year , Japan signed a similar deferment agreement with Russia for debts worth 180 million dollars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;0	In the harshest Dutch move yet to repulse a tidal wave of refugees , Parliament Friday authorized the government to automatically bar all asylum seekers arriving overland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;1	The measure is aimed at stemming a flow of asylum seekers that has severely strained government resources and led to a rightist resurgence in May 's national elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;2	`` We do n't want to send people back to face danger , '' said spokesman Tom van der Maas for the right-wing Liberals , one of the three ruling coalition partners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;3	`` But we need to redirect this inflow of people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;4	It 's an effort to spread the burden throughout Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;5	`` This is an ugly law , '' countered Fronnie Biesma , spokesman for the Dutch Refugee Council .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;6	`` We are just transferring the responsibility to other countries . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;7	The legislation takes direct aim at the Netherlands ' international reputation as a safe haven for the persecuted , a label that this year will draw an estimated 55,000 asylum seekers to this nation of 15 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;8	The new law would bar any asylum seekers who had traveled through so-called `` safe third countries '' where they could have applied for asylum before reaching the Netherlands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;9	Virtually assured of becoming law , the legal stratagem is aimed primarily at the `` economic migrants '' who shuttle around Europe in search of the best residency and benefits deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;10	In practice , the law will bar the vast majority of asylum seekers , who usually arrive overland by bus , car or train from neighboring Germany or Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;11	Relatively few come by airplane or ship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;12	The new law would bar people like 26-year-old Babak Alighorian who left his family back in Iran and applied for political asylum here in April 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;13	`` This is not good , '' said Alighorian , who arrived in the Netherlands after traveling through Turkey , Bulgaria , Romania , Hungary , Austria , and Germany by car and by bus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;14	Under the new measure , Alighorian would have been turned back to Germany .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;15	Instead he got a one-year residency permit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;16	While rejected asylum seekers will still have the right of appeal in civil courts , it is unclear how long that would take and whether the government would support them pending a ruling .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;17	Friday 's lower house passage virtually guarantees upper house approval by early next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;18	A list of safe countries will be drawn up by the Justice Ministry once the measure becomes law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;19	The Dutch measure is a direct response to a similar law passed by the German government last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;20	`` Since Germany approved the return of refugees to the safe third country , the number of asylum seekers there has decreased tremendously , while in the Netherlands the number has significantly increased , '' the Justice Ministry said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;21	Before the Dutch government began clamping down on asylum applicants in recent years , the country had one of Europe 's most liberal asylum policies and a generous benefit package to match .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;22	But with a new get-tough policy in place since last year , new `` flying squads '' of immigration officers are now policing the border and two asylum centers opened near the German and Belgian borders this fall to turn away bogus applicants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;23	As of October , the Justice Ministry has received 44,492 asylum applications this year , a rise of more than 16,500 over the same period in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0192;24	The cost to shelter and feed them will be about 1.6 billion guilders -LRB- dlrs 909 million -RRB- this year , according to the National Center for Asylum Seekers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;0	Yasser Arafat and an Islamic leader formed a committee Friday to work out differences and prevent violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;1	Both hailed it as a start to ending two weeks of tension following bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;2	Israel has demanded that Arafat crack down on the Islamic Resistance Movement , or Hamas , which has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed 32 Israelis since early October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;3	Hamas and the more radical Islamic Jihad oppose the peace accord that Arafat signed with the Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;4	Clashes between Muslim militants and PLO police left 15 people dead on Nov. 18 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;5	But Arafat can not afford to ignore the popular support for the militant groups , especially among the poor , and is trying to persuade them to participate in his self-rule government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;6	Arafat advisor Ahmed Tibi said Friday 's meeting with Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar was the start of a `` real dialogue between the sides . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;7	`` It was a warm and fruitful meeting between myself and my brother and what we have agreed on is good for both sides , '' Zahar told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0193;8	Tibi said the nine-member committee , which includes Hamas and PLO officials as well as two Israeli Arabs , would meet Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;0	Caterpillar Inc. has appointed a new independent dealership for the Shanghai area , the first such appointment since the company announced plans earlier to expand its presence in China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;1	The new dealership , Lei Shing Hong Machinery Ltd. , will be headed by C.K. Lau , principal owner of the dealership 's holding company , Hong Kong-based Lei Shing Hong Ltd. , Caterpillar said in a statement Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;2	The sales and service agreement , signed Friday , is effective April 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;3	The new dealership will be based in Kunshan , outside Shanghai , and will cover three east-central provinces -- Jiangsu , Anhui and Zhejiang .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;4	Chinese customers have been served by one independent dealer , China Engineers Ltd. , which covers three southern provinces , and one wholly owned dealership , Caterpillar China Ltd.
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;5	Both are based in Hong Kong .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;6	Caterpillar has been selling its heavy equipment to China since 1975 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0194;7	It has entered 12 technology transfer agreements and has formed two manufacturing joint ventures in China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;1	But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev maintained for a second day his strong opposition to a NATO plan for drawing up conditions for adding new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;2	He told a joint meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not develop close ties with the alliance until it spelled out its expansion plans , alliances sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether the Western military alliance had changed from its Cold War days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;4	On Thursday , the Russian stunned NATO ministers by his last-minute refusal to agree to a special cooperation program with the alliance to protest the decision to prepare for a future expansion to the East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;5	NATO ministers sought to play down Kozyrev 's outburst .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;6	`` We should n't make too much of yesterday 's events , '' U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told CBS ' `` This Morning '' program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;7	`` -LRB- The -RRB- Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did ... I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;8	Christopher met separately with Kozyrev for more than an hour Friday to discuss the dispute as well as the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;9	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;10	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;11	Willy Claes , secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the formal session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;12	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;13	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the two-day meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;14	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;15	`` The Russians have their internal situation ... This is all a little bit more complicated , '' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;16	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;17	Christopher , Hurd , Kinkel and Kozyrev were meeting later in the day with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to try to revive the peace process in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;18	Juppe and Hurd may fly to Belgrade this weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;19	On Thursday , the allies decided to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0195;20	To overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , NATO had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;0	It took Joe Montana 's heroics for Kansas City to beat Denver in their first meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;1	This time , Montana is one of many injured Chiefs , and the Broncos are on the upswing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;2	That puts Chiefs reserve quarterback Steve Bono on the spot Sunday when the Broncos visit Kansas City in the 13th round of the U.S. National Football League season , and Denver quarterback John Elway renews his special relationship with Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;3	Denver -LRB- 6-6 -RRB- comes in with playoff hopes still alive after a dismal 0-4 start .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;4	Kansas City is down to 7-5 after failing to score a touchdown in a 10-9 loss at Seattle last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;5	Montana sprained his foot as the Chiefs fell two games behind San Diego in the AFC West .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;6	The Chiefs ' injured players slowly are recovering , but the club still listed 14 players on the official list .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;7	Key players such as defensive end Neil Smith , tackle John Alt and running back Marcus Allen practiced at midweek , but they probably will have limited roles if they play Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;8	Schottenheimer said the emphasis has been on limiting the game plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;9	`` We 're playing with guys that have not been that involved in the system , '' Schottenheimer said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;10	`` When you are struggling with something , you do less and you do it better .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;11	You follow your philosophy , and my philosophy is you do less so you do it better . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;12	Like the Kansas City-Denver matchup , this weekend features mostly intradivisional games , such as Buffalo at Miami and New York at New England in the AFC East Division ; Pittsburgh at Cincinnati in the AFC Central ; Los Angeles at San Diego in the other AFC West matchup , which will be Monday night ; Atlanta at San Francisco and New Orleans at Los Angeles in the NFC West ; Green Bay at Detroit in the NFC Central ; and Dallas at Philadelphia in the NFC East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;13	Also , Arizona visits Houston , the New York Giants are at Cleveland , Indianapolis travels to Seattle and Washington goes to Tampa Bay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;14	The long weekend started Thursday night when Minnesota pulled into a tie for first in the NFC Central with a 33-27 overtime victory over Chicago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;15	Cris Carter scored on a 65-yard touchdown pass from Warren Moon two plays after Kevin Butler missed a potential game-winning field goal from 40 yards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;16	Denver decided after it fell to a 1-5 record to become more aggressive defensively .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;17	The Chiefs noticed the Broncos have won three in a row by blitzing more .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;18	`` The old adage is if you blitz and you do it efficiently , you will have success , '' Schottenheimer said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;19	`` If you do n't do it efficiently , you end up getting burned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;20	Right now , they are doing it very effectively . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;21	Elway has recovered from some early season mistakes -- three interceptions for touchdowns -- to become his old self .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;22	He passed for 382 yards two weeks ago , and Denver had just enough last week at home to beat Cincinnati in a game played in a driving wind and a minus-2 wind chill .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;23	`` The goal was to get to .500 and dig ourselves out of the hole , '' Elway said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;24	`` It seemed like the harder we tried , the worse it got .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;25	At 0-4 , we wanted to start brand new , clean the slate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;26	At 0-4 , you 're not sure you 're ever going to win a game . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;27	The Chiefs acquired Bono for , as Schottenheimer put it , `` a winning performance , '' and he will get his chance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;28	Bono is eager for the start .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;29	`` I ca n't worry about what rust there is , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;30	`` I 'm not expecting a week of practice will shake it off .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;31	I just hope to have a good week of practice and hope we play well on Sunday . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;32	San Diego has been in front of the AFC West all year and has an excellent chance to take full control by beating the Raiders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;33	San Diego can clinch the division with a win over the Raiders and a Kansas City loss to Denver .
APW_ENG_19941202.0196;34	The Chargers can clinch a playoff berth with a win over the Raiders and a Kansas City win or tie against Denver and either a Buffalo loss or tie at Miami or a New York Jets loss or tie at New England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;0	Russian lawmakers who came to Chechnya to negotiate an end to a standoff with Moscow pointed fingers at their own government Friday , saying jets attacking the tiny republic are clearly Russian .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;1	President Boris Yeltsin 's government has denied providiny any military support to the Chechen rebels seeking to topple Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , even as the rebel offensive has escalated from small arms fire to missiles and bombs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;2	Defense Minister Pavel Grachev says mercenaries are fighting on both sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;3	Dudayev , however , who declared independence for his Caucasus Mountain republic in 1991 , flatly accuses Moscow of leading and arming the opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;4	Meanwhile , air raids on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , continued Friday for a fourth day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;5	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , a member of parliament and Yeltsin 's former social welfare minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;6	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;7	Other members of the four-person parliamentary delegation , which has met briefly with Dudayev , also called for an end to the air strikes , warning the conflict could spiral out of control .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;8	The group is specifically trying to negotiate the release of about 70 Russians -- including , allegedly , some Army soldiers and officers -- who were captured in the fighting in Chechnya , a mostly Muslim republic in southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;9	Dudayev at first threatened to kill the prisoners , but later said they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;10	Since the rebels ' air offensive began last week , thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;11	Chechen officials said there was another round of air raids early Friday east of Grozny , including one at Shali , home to a tank regiment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;12	On Thursday , a small airfield near Grozny was hit and four people died in a missile attack at Katayama , about 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- from Grozny , where Dudayev lives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;13	Dudayev said his home was bombed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;14	An old bus also was hit by shrapnel , and its floor was covered with sawdust Friday to soak up blood .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;15	`` We saw two planes fly over this morning , '' the commander of the airfield , Biali Chimayev , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;16	`` We 're expecting another attack . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;17	The raids have destroyed a number of aircraft at civilian and military airports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;18	Moscow does not recognize the independence of Chechnya , which became part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;19	Yeltsin threatened on Tuesday to send in troops unless the fighting had stopped by Thursday , but when the deadline expired he softened his stance , saying Chechen fighters would be given amnesty if they put down their weapons by Dec. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;20	Still , there were media reports of Russian troop buildups near the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;21	`` Chauvinist forces in Russian are pushing President Yeltsin to act , saying he can not control ` little ' Chechnya , '' warned Vladimir Lysenko , a member of the parliamentary delegation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;22	Although ultranationalists , like the flamboyant Vladimir Zhirinovsky , constantly lament the loss of Moscow 's empire , most Russians appear ready to let the Chechens go their own way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;23	More than 74 percent of 3,250 people questioned in a new poll said Russia should recognize Chechnya 's independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;24	Only 5.5 percent opposed it and 20.3 percent had no opinion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;25	The poll , released Thursday by the International Opinion Research Center , had a 1 percent margin of error .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;26	Although Chechens are at odds , they are united in their distrust of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;27	Lysenko warned that the conflict is endangering the lives of as many as 150,000 ethnic Russians in Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;28	In Copenhagen , a Russian journalist said Friday he received a fax from a group threatening Russians abroad if Moscow does not recognize Chechnya 's independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;29	The threat was signed `` K.K.K.O. 130 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;30	year , '' which Danish police said might stand for the North Caucasian Liberation Army .
APW_ENG_19941202.0197;31	Police in Copenhagen said they heard the group has been active in other countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;0	NATO foreign ministers sought Friday to reassure Russia that their plans for admitting former Warsaw Pact foes would n't create a new division in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;1	But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev maintained for a second day his strong opposition to a NATO plan for drawing up conditions for adding new members in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;2	He told a joint meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not develop close ties with the alliance until it spelled out its expansion plans , alliances sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether the Western military alliance had changed from its Cold War days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;4	On Thursday , the Russian stunned NATO ministers by his last-minute refusal to agree to a special cooperation program with the alliance to protest the decision to prepare for a future expansion to the East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;5	NATO ministers sought to play down Kozyrev 's outburst .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;6	`` We should n't make too much of yesterday 's events , '' U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told CBS ' `` This Morning '' program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;7	`` -LRB- The -RRB- Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did ... I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;8	Christopher met separately with Kozyrev for more than an hour Friday to discuss the dispute as well as the situation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;9	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;10	He said ties between Moscow and NATO were `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;11	Willy Claes , secretary-general of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization , opened the formal session by saying : `` The division of Europe has ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;12	We have worked ... to ensure that it never returns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;13	Kozyrev 's comments cast a pall over the two-day meeting and over NATO 's attempt to draw its former Warsaw Pact enemies into its alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;14	However , some diplomats suggested he was playing to an audience back in Russia , where the government is contending with a strong nationalist opposition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;15	`` The Russians have their internal situation ... This is all a little bit more complicated , '' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;16	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would go with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;17	Christopher , Hurd , Kinkel and Kozyrev were meeting later in the day with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to try to revive the peace process in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;18	Juppe and Hurd may fly to Belgrade this weekend to push the initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;19	On Thursday , the allies decided to conduct a 12-month study of the terms and conditions for expanding the Western military alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0198;20	To overcome Russian objections to its eastward expansion , NATO had agreed to a special relationship with Moscow and insisted they had no intention of forming a hostile bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;0	The Department of Foreign Affairs said Friday two Filipinos have been arrested in Saipan on charges of trying to smuggle drugs into the island .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;1	The foreign office , quoting a report from the Philippine consulate in Saipan , identified those arrested as construction businessman Ignacio Agbanlog and his employee , Fernando Garzon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;2	Garzon was arrested shortly after arriving Nov. 24 in Saipan on a flight from Manila , the foreign office said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;3	It said customs police seized 300 grams -LRB- 10 ounces -RRB- of crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride , called `` ice '' in Saipan and `` shabu '' in Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;4	Agbanlog was arrested in his office in San Vicente in Saipan the following day , it said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;5	The report did not say why Agbanlog was arrested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;6	The Superior Court of Saipan has set dlrs 340,000 bail for each of the two .
APW_ENG_19941202.0199;7	A hearing has been set sometime this month , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;0	A former SS concentration camp commander serving a life term for killing 650 Jewish slave laborers was indicted Friday on 144 new charges of murder and abetting murder .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;1	Josef Schwammberger , 82 , who sicked his dog on inmates and shot a rabbi for refusing to work on a Jewish holiday , was sentenced in May 1992 in the last major Nazi trial in Germany .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;2	Prosecutor Kurt Schrimm said the new indictment stemmed from evidence that surfaced during Schwammberger 's earlier trial but could n't be introduced because it was n't included in the request for Schwammberger 's 1990 extradition from Argentina , where he fled in 1948 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;3	Schwammberger is accused of ordering mass executions and of murdering individual prisoners himself , Schrimm said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;4	During the earlier trial , Schwammberger admitted running the forced labor camps of Rozwadow , Mielec and Przemysl , all in Poland , between 1942 and 1944 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;5	But he denied killing anyone and said he could n't remember many of the events that were discussed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;6	Despite Schwammberger 's age , Schrimm said , the court has the duty to punish him for every crime it can prove .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;7	It could take six months for the judge to examine the charges and the defense 's likely objection to a new trial .
APW_ENG_19941202.0200;8	Earlier this year , Simon Wiesenthal , the Austrian Nazi-hunter , said that with the apparent death of SS commander Alois Brunner in Syria in 1992 , it was unlikely any other major Nazis would be captured or prosecuted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;0	The trial of three British soldiers accused of killing a Danish woman bogged down in legal complications Friday , with defense attorneys demanding the case be thrown out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;1	The trial was adjourned until Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;2	There have been a string of adjournments since the men were arrested Sept. 13 for slaying Louise Jensen , a 23-year-old tour guide from Hirthshals , northern Denmark , after kidnapping her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;3	Friday 's move followed a ruling by the three-judge court in this south coast resort city that it was competent to hear arguments on a defense motion for dismissal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;4	The defense claims the confiscation of confidential notes the men had written for their lawyers by a guard in Nicosia 's Central prison , the only one on the east Mediterranean island , was illegal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;5	State prosecutor Petros Clerides asked for time to consult the attorney general and stressed that such a legal point has never been raised in Cyprus before .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;6	That opened the possibility the case will be referred to the Supreme Court , the republic 's highest court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;7	That could delay the trial for weeks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;8	The soldiers are privates Alan Ford , 26 , of Birmingham ; Justin Fowler , 26 , of Falmouth , Cornwall ; and Jeff Parnell , 23 , of Oldbury , West Midlands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;9	They have yet to enter their pleas on charges of manslaughter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;10	The original charge of premeditated murder was reduced last month because the prosecution decided it might not be able to prove the men had planned to kill Jensen before they abducted her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;11	Police said the Britons have admitted kidnapping and killing Jensen in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa Sept. 13 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;12	Her battered body was found in a shallow grave two days later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;13	The soldiers were arrested at a police roadblock with bloodstains on their clothes and a blood-covered shovel in their car a few hours after Jensen 's Cypriot boyfriend reported her abduction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0201;14	All three serve with the Royal Greenjackets Regiments at the British Sovereign Base of Dhekelia on the island 's south coast .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;0	The wandering skull of a 14th century religious reformer has found its way home to St. Lebuinus Church , courtesy of an anonymous do-gooder .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;1	Geert Groote died of the Black Plague in 1384 , and his remains were interred in the church to be venerated by the faithful .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;2	After six centuries , a skull was all that was left of the penitential preacher known to church historians as Gerardus Magnus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;3	And even that disappeared 14 years ago , stolen from the church 's reliquary .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;4	Thursday church caretaker Nico Geelen found a box pushed inside the church 's door marked `` Fragile , But Not Hazardous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;5	It contained the skull and a small piece of stone carved with the Latin words meaning `` Here is the head of a deacon and a very holy man . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;6	`` I always had the feeling it would come back one day , '' said Geelen , adding that the skull 's authenticity was verified through photos .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;7	Groote made a rebellious name for himself preaching against corruption in the medieval Roman Catholic Church .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;8	One of Deventer 's most famous sons , Groote was educated in Paris but rejected the priesthood by claiming he was not holy enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;9	He died at 44 when the Black Death came to Deventer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;10	Instead of being hidden away , Groote 's skull will now go to the city museum .
APW_ENG_19941202.0202;11	Geelen said he did n't think Groote would be too concerned where it ends up , `` so long as his ideas survive . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;0	Wayne Gretzky says the difficult part of a six-city Scandinavian tour for his team of locked-out National Hockey League players is done , though the games have n't even started .
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;1	`` This is my first and last time to organize a tour , '' Gretzky said Thursday before his squad lost to the International Hockey League 's Detroit Vipers 4-3 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;2	`` If somebody else wants to put one together , I 'll go but this has been a hell of a lot of work . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;3	Among his tasks were finding a plane that could return to North America on moment 's notice should the NHL players and owners strike a deal , getting European teams to agree to play them and finding available dates , arenas and practice times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;4	The 19 locked out NHLers start the tour on Saturday against the Finnish team Jokerit in Helsinki , followed by games in Tampere , Finland ; Oslo , Norway and Stockholm , Goteborg , Sweden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;5	The trip ends on Dec. 12 in Malmo , Sweden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0203;6	All six dates were sold out as of Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;0	Peter Karrie , one of the most anonymous celebrities in the world of stage , says his role as the masked phantom in the mega-musical `` The Phantom of the Opera '' fills every moment of his waking hours .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;1	`` Once you have rehearsed the role and adopted it , he is with you all the time , ' said Karrie , the 48-year-old tenor who has portrayed the popular Andrew Lloyd Webber character for the last three years in London and Toronto .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;2	He has appeared more than 1,000 times on stage as the phantom in the award-winning production , which has garnered dlrs 1 billion since it first opened in London 's West End in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;3	`` When you wake up in the morning , when you go out shopping , you are thinking about it all the time , '' Karrie , a native of Wales , told Singapore reporters Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;4	He spoke by video-telephone from Toronto where he is currently performing as the phantom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;5	The 45-minute news conference via satellite was called to announce that Karrie would also be playing the love-stricken phantom when the dlrs 12 million musical opens in Singapore in February .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;6	Although he dominates the nearly three-hour show , Karrie appears in a white mask , wig and cape .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;7	That 's why most autograph seekers are unable to recognize him even when he walks into the dress circle , Karrie said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;8	`` It would be nice to be recognized sometimes , '' said Karrie .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;9	`` The Phantom of the Opera , '' which opened in Broadway in 1988 and in Toronto in September 1989 , is based on a French novel about a hideously deformed phantom who lurks beneath the stage of the Paris Opera House .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;10	He falls in love with a young soprano and devotes himself to creating a new star for the opera .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;11	The Singapore production will be directed by Harold Prince , winner of 19 Tony awards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;12	Karrie , when asked what goes into his role , said : `` Some Welsh passion . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;13	Asked how he keeps fit for the physically demanding role , Karrie said he uses `` ginseng , '' a Chinese herbal tonic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;14	`` It is great .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;15	We 've got it over here .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;16	I take some ginseng every day , '' he said with a wink and thumbs-up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;17	`` I also do some workout in the gym .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;18	And drink lots of water . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;19	Karrie , who starred as the phantom for 18 months in the West End , has previously portrayed the heroic lead Jean Valijean in `` Les Miserables , '' Che in `` Evita , '' the American in `` Chess '' and Judas in `` Jesus Christ Superstar . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;20	Phantom 's staging in Singapore is also an attempt by local authorities to show the city-state as not just a moneymaking center of commerce but a growing cultural and performing arts hub in the region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0204;21	Earlier this year , the popular Broadway production `` Cats '' was performed here following a production of `` Les Miserables . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;0	Sol Kerzner , creator of the Sun City gambling complex , may face charges of bribery and corruption dating back eight years , according to news reports Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;1	Justice Ministry attorney Christo Nel said an investigation into a bribe Kerzner offered officials in the former Transkei black homeland in 1986 had been reopened and could result in formal charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;2	Kerzner has admitted offering the bribe of 2 million rand -LRB- dlrs 909,000 at the exchange rate at the time -RRB- in return for exclusive gambling rights in the Transkei , one of four homelands granted independence under the apartheid era plan to strip blacks of South African citizenship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;3	Although no other countries ever recognized the homelands ' sovereignty , their nominal independence allowed Kerzner to build a string of lavish casinos and resorts without violating South African laws against gambling .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;4	After admitting the bribe at a South African judicial inquest in 1989 , he avoided prosecution by staying out of the Transkei .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;5	Former Transkei prime minister George Matanzima was imprisoned in the Transkei for accepting the bribe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;6	The nation 's first all-race election in April ended apartheid and scrapped the homeland system , with the regions becoming part of South Africa again .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;7	Nel , who was attorney general in the Transkei , said it would take up to six months to complete the investigation and decide if enough of a case existed to press charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;8	Kerzner has built a multibillion rand -LRB- dollar -RRB- empire from his hotel and gambling resorts in South Africa and Europe , and plans to open similar complexes in the Bahamas and the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;9	One news report said Kerzner 's ties with top officials of the new African National Congress-led government would allow him to avoid prosecution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0205;10	President Nelson Mandela 's office issued a statement in response , denying any possibility of interference with the judicial process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;0	U.S. congressional clearance of a new world trade accord is expected to encourage ratification by other countries , allowing the mammoth export-boosting pact to take effect as planned on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;1	Large and small nations alike are trying to rush the 22,000-page GATT agreement through national parliaments , often in low-key processes compared to the rocky ride through Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;2	Nearly 40 countries , including the United States , have now ratified the 124-nation agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;3	About 40 more -- including Japan , the European Union and Canada -- have said they will do so by year 's end .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;4	The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , Peter Sutherland , said Friday that U.S. passage was a `` triumph '' that will help make the world a more prosperous place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;5	`` This is a day for particular celebration , '' GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;6	`` The successful culmination of this debate proved that common sense still works . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;7	The U.S. Senate approved the GATT treaty by 76-24 votes late Thursday -- a much bigger margin than expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;8	The House of Representatives cleared the deal earlier in the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;9	Congressional approval , uncertain for weeks , was deemed crucial for the the World Trade Organization to take effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;10	The WTO will implement the new accord and have more powers than GATT to settle trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;11	`` I warmly welcome the vote by the U.S. Senate , '' said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , Europe 's chief negotiator in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;12	He said the 12-nation bloc would complete the approval process by Dec. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;13	In Japan , Trade Minister Rytaro Hashimoto said U.S. ratification of the deal would encourage other countries to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;14	Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament passed the accord early Friday and it will now move to the upper house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;15	This view was echoed by Hong Kong 's Director-General of Trade , Tony Miller .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;16	`` The world looks to the United States for leadership in promoting free trade under the multilateral regime , '' Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;17	In Canberra , Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said the U.S. result was `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;18	Sutherland said he expected about 100 of GATT 's 124 member nations to ratify the trade accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;19	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to knock down barriers to free world trade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;20	The pact is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;21	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0206;22	`` We will have a rules-based system that allows for the development of the world economy and provides an assurance of security , prosperity and reduction of tensions , '' Sutherland said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;0	A German man was arrested Friday on charges of having sex with young boys and filming them in pornographic videos he sold abroad , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;1	Nierenz Bernd Karl-Heinz , of Eberswacde , Germany , refused to open the door when police came to his apartment on a tip from neighbors , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;2	They used a key to open the door and said they found four boys -- age 12 and 13 -- hiding in their underpants in the bathroom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;3	Police reported that the boys said they had sex with Heinz .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;4	Police seized four videos of young Thai boys having sex and a large stack of photographs of them posing nude , police Maj. Nawin Klamsang said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;5	Nawin said it was unclear how long Heinz had been living in Thailand but noted that he spoke fluent Thai .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;6	Other officers said Heinz had lured the boys to his home with offers to pay them 20 baht -LRB- 80 cents -RRB- and let them play video games .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;7	If they came again , the boys were offered 100 baht -LRB- dlrs 4 -RRB- to pose nude for a still camera , they said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;8	And , on subsequent visits , they were paid 100 baht -LRB- dlrs 4 -RRB- to act in pornographic videos , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0207;9	Heinz is to appear in court within the month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;0	A substantially bigger-than-expected gain in construction employment helped force the U.S. unemployment rate down to the lowest level in four years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;1	The Labor Department said a seasonally adjusted 350,000 new workers were added to the nation 's nonfarm payrolls , pushing the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;2	That is the lowest level since August 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;3	The jobless rate has been declining all year , dropping 1.1 percent since January .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;4	The nation 's nonfarm payrolls have increased by 1.4 million people this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;5	The report suggests the economy is still growing at a robust pace and employment growth remains strong .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;6	However , the government 's chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity pointed in the other direction , falling in October for the first time in 15 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;7	The Index of Leading Economic Indicators slipped 0.1 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;8	In advance of the unemployment report , most economists were expecting the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 percent and nonfarm payrolls to increase by about 250,000 workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;9	Even the most optimistic analysts were expecting an increase no bigger than 280,000 jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;10	Strong employment growth this year was one of the factors that prompted the central bank to raise short-term interest rates last month for a sixth time this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;11	Last month , the central bank raised key rates three-quarters of a percentage point , the largest increase in 13 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;12	The large number of new hires was boosted by unexpectedly robust growth in construction employment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;13	The Labor Department said 71,000 jobs were added to construction industry payrolls in November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;14	Manufacturing employment also was robust , jumping 51,000 after increases of just over 18,000 in the previous three months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;15	Gains were recorded in manufacture of durable goods , including lumber , fabricated metals , industrial machinery and electronic equipment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0208;16	As expected , most of the new hires were in service industries , including 25,000 in retail trade and a substantial 26,000 increase in the number of government workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;0	Some 76,000 Rwandans already in Zaire poured into internationally run refugee camps this week under orders from Zairean police forces after clashes with the local population , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;1	Sylvana Foa , spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , said the agency was surprised by the numbers of Rwandans outside the camps , which she said were `` already badly overloaded . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;2	There are already an estimated 850,000 Rwandans in the camps on the border of Rwanda and Zaire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;3	The Rwandans , mostly Hutu , fled their country last summer following the takeover of the government by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;4	Zairean forces ordered the Rwandans into the camps following a clash last week in a village near Goma , Zaire , that left 24 refugees and three Zaireans dead and 77 wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;5	Foa said the violence appeared to have started because of stealing from tradesmen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;6	As a result of the Zairean order , 45,000 refugees streamed into Kitale camp , 18,000 into Kibumba camp , and 13,000 into Kahindo camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0209;7	Foa said relief workers have begun looking for a site for a new camp to help ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;0	Australia opened the World Series one-day cricket campaign in unimpressive fashion Friday with a two-wicket victory over Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;1	Chasing 166-9 to win , Australia limped home after 47.2 overs , losing 4-8 in the closing overs with part-time Zimbabwean spinner Grant Flower picking up three wickets to ensure a tight finish .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;2	Mark Waugh , who strained a groin muscle while bowling his first and only over in the Zimbabwe innings , came in at No. 9 with Michael Slater as a runner and scored an unbeaten six .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;3	Mark Taylor and Slater got the home side off to an ideal start with an opening partnership of 69 at more than four runs an over .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;4	But when the openers departed in the 15th and 16th overs , the runs dried up and Zimbabwe tightened the screws to prolong what always seemed like the inevitable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;5	Taylor was not happy with Australia 's display .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;6	`` It was a very scrappy performance from both sides , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;7	`` There was nothing wrong with the pitch .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;8	At one stage I thought it looked like a 230-run wicket .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;9	`` We lost our way with a lack or urgency and some silly shots . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;10	Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower said his side was inconsistent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;11	`` Our guys bowled well but our batting was not up to scratch and we lost too many wickets in the middle stages after setting up a good platform , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;12	Flower said Australia had not seen the best of his side in the opening contest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;13	`` I honestly believe we can get up around the 250 mark against any of the sides in the competition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;14	We have the talent to do that , we just need a few of us to get going together . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0210;15	Zimbabwe 's next match is against the Australia A side at the WACA on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;0	Japan , the only country that has suffered atomic attacks , expressed displeasure for a second day Friday over a U.S. plan to issue a postal stamp showing a nuclear mushroom cloud .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;1	`` I do n't think the Japanese people will have good feelings toward the design of the stamp , '' Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;2	`` We may convey our feelings to the U.S. side in some form , '' he told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;3	The U.S. Postal Service plans to begin selling the stamp next September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;4	The stamp depicts the explosion of the atomic bomb dropped by U.S. forces on the city of Hiroshima in the closing days of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;5	Under the mushroom cloud , it says , `` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;6	In Washington , Postal Service spokesman Robin Wright said the stamp is part of a series of stamps on World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;7	`` We would be remiss in omitting such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic bomb , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;8	`` Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of events of World War II and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events , '' Wright added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;9	Within five months after the bombing of Hiroshima , about 140,000 of the city 's 340,000 residents died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;10	Another atomic bombing of Nagasaki three days later killed 70,000 of that city 's 270,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;11	Several days later , on Aug. 15 , 1945 , Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;12	Survivors of the atomic bombing and anti-nuclear activists expressed anger over the stamp on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;13	Sunao Tsuboi , a leader of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-Bomb Survivors ' Organizations , called the stamp `` outrageous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0211;14	`` It makes our blood boil with anger , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0213;0	The government agreed Friday to extend to 1997 the deadline for Russia 's repayment of $ 100 million owned by the former Soviet Union to Japan 's Export-Import Bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0213;1	Notes concerning the agreement were exchanged in Tokyo , the Foreign Ministry said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0213;2	Earlier this year , Japan signed a similar deferment agreement with Russia for debts of $ 180 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;0	How did Gen. Colin L. Powell , Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , relax during the Gulf War ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;1	Listening to calypso music , the retired American military chief told students at the University of the West Indies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;2	Powell , 57 , the child of Jamaican immigrants to the United States , received an honorary degree from the institution late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;3	Earlier in the day , he accepted the Order of Jamaica , the nation 's equivalent to knighthood in the British system .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;4	Powell told students he was pleased to be included among UWI 's earlier honorees , naming South African President Nelson Mandela , Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;5	`` But there is one name that I have to single out as I look through all of those honorees of the past , '' Powell said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;6	`` This one person for all those 35 years for me has been an inspiration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;7	And even during those dark days of Desert Storm when I was alone in my office , pondering matters of war and peace , this person was in the office with me in spirit helping me . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;8	The crowd broke up in laughter when Powell named his inspiration -- The Mighty Sparrow , Trinidad 's venerable calypso king .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;9	`` Let it be known far and wide that during the period of Desert Storm when I was in my office , I had my tape recorder with all of my Sparrow records lined up , '' Powell said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;10	`` And members of my staff and senior generals would come into the office to talk about the issues of the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0214;11	And I would have a smile on my face ... They never quite understood what was coming out of that music box . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;0	Army running back Kevin Vaughn ca n't begin to count how many times he 's heard `` Beat Navy '' in his four years at West Point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;1	`` The underclassmen have to greet us with ` Beat Navy . '
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;2	So that 's 1,000 underclassmen greeting you day in and day out , '' Vaughn said before the annual renewal of the legendary U.S. college football rivalry between the American military service academies on Saturday at Veterans Stadium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;3	`` It 's plastered on the walls and on the roofs of buildings on the campus , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;4	`` It 's everywhere .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;5	You ca n't go 10 steps without either seeing it or hearing it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;6	Navy quarterback Jim Kubiak gets the appropriate variation of that greeting every time a plebe passes by at Annapolis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;7	`` I ca n't tell you how many times I 've heard ` Beat Army ' in my lifetime , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;8	`` So many times , I can hear it in my sleep . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;9	While other U.S. college football teams judge their season on whether or not they get to a post-season `` bowl '' game , Army and Navy determine their success on whether or not they beat each other .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;10	Since the 1960s , both Army and Navy , once U.S. college football powerhouses , have struggled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;11	They are unable to recruit top players because of a six-year committment each graduate must make to his branch of the U.S. military as payment for his education .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;12	Most pro teams are not willing to wait six years for a player to become eligible -- especially since they wo n't be playing in that time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;13	And college football is a stepping stone to the pros .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;14	But the lackluster records have not , and do not , dampen the spirit , intensity or enthusiasm of the Army-Navy rivalry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;15	It equals any bowl game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;16	In 94 meetings , Army has won only once more than Navy , 44 victories to 43 , with seven draws .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;17	The Navy `` Midshipmen '' have outscored the Army `` Cadets '' 1,203-1 ,135 -- a difference of only seventh-tenths of a point per game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;18	Army eked out a 16-14 victory last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;19	The Cadets jumped out to a 16-0 lead in the third quarter before Kubiak engineered two touchdown drives and one final drive that ended at the Army 1-yard-line with six seconds to play .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;20	Ryan Bucchianeri then missed an 18-yard field goal attempt that would have given Navy the victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;21	`` They might say , ` It 's over with ' and all that , but , you know what ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;22	That 's still in your mind , and you go to sleep with it every night , '' said Kubiak , who holds Navy career records for completions -LRB- 534 -RRB- and yards -LRB- 5,647 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;23	`` And everybody on our football team wants to change that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;24	Navy has momentum on its side .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;25	After an 0-5 start , it has won three of its last five .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;26	Kubiak said an inexperienced offensive line has begun to play together : After being sacked 31 times in Navy 's first nine games , he was only sacked twice in their last game , a 29-17 victory over Rice .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;27	Army 's season has gone in the opposite direction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;28	The Cadets opened with a victory over Holy Cross and got consecutive victories over Louisville and The Citadel , but they have also lost games they could have won against Temple , Rutgers , Wake Forest , Air Force and Boston University .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;29	Army coach Bob Sutton said there is one key for his team against Navy 's pass-oriented attack .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;30	`` A big part of this game is tackling , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;31	`` They throw a lot of passes where receivers are definitely going to catch the ball .
APW_ENG_19941202.0218;32	You have to be able to keep the gains to a minimum . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;0	Volkwagen 's worldwide sales are up 7.1 percent in the first 10 months of this year but the automaker is still in early stages of its rebuilding , managing board chief Ferdinand Piech said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;1	`` We have made about 20 percent of the improvements that we set as our goal , '' Piech told financial analysts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;2	`` In costs and quality clear progress has been attained , but there still is a lot of work ahead of us to be in the lead in worldwide competition . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;3	Volkwagen released Piech 's comments in a statement that put world sales at 2.75 million vehicles through 10 months of 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;4	The statement did not refer directly to German media reports that Germany 's biggest car maker was still planning large staff cuts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;5	The company put most of its workers in Germany on a four-day work week early this year , in a pact to avoid big layoffs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;6	On Thursday , VW denied it was planning to dismiss 50,000 workers worldwide to get down to a payroll of 194,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0219;7	Piech told the analysts that VW 's planning is dynamic and is reviewed annually .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;0	Zairean police ordered some 76,000 Rwandans into refugee camps this week after clashes with the local population , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;1	Sylvana Foa , spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , said the agency was surprised by the numbers of Rwandans outside the internationally run camps , which she said were `` already badly overloaded . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;2	There are already an estimated 850,000 Rwandans in the camps on the border of Rwanda and Zaire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;3	The Rwandans , mostly Hutu , fled their country last summer following the takeover of the government by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;4	Zairean forces ordered the Rwandans into the camps following a clash last week in a village near Goma , Zaire , that left 24 refugees and three Zaireans dead and 77 wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;5	Foa said the violence appeared to have started because of stealing from merchants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;6	As a result of the Zairean order , 45,000 refugees streamed into Kitale camp , 18,000 into Kibumba camp , and 13,000 into Kahindo camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0220;7	Foa said relief workers have begun looking for a site for a new camp to help ease the overcrowding .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;0	Premier Edouard Balladur assured world soccer chief Joao Havelange on Friday that France was on course to host a successful World Cup in 1998 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;1	But Balladur admitted his government 's influence was limited .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;2	`` As for successes on the field , it 's up to our national team to achieve them , '' he said of the squad that failed to reach this year 's finals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;3	`` I wish them good luck . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;4	Havelange met Balladur and senior French soccer officials at the close of a week-long trip in which the president of FIFA visited eight of the 10 cities that will host matches during the 1998 finals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;5	`` With this meeting , we kick off the operational phase of organization , '' Balladur said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;6	`` All the essential decisions have been made . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;7	Havelange said he was very satisfied with his tour and confident that preparations would be completed on time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;8	He confirmed that the draw for the qualifying groups would be held Dec. 12 , 1995 , in Paris , and the draw for 32-team finals would be in Marseille in December 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;9	The opening ceremony will be on the Champs-Elysees , the famed Paris boulevard , either June 10 or June 12 , 1998 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;10	Havelange said it was possible the final could be played on July 14 , France 's national holiday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;11	He predicted the matches would draw an average crowd of at least 40,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;12	Balladur said his government has agreed to pay 36 percent of the cost of stadium improvements and infrastructure expansion , up from 30 percent pledged by the Socialist government ousted in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;13	The major project is construction of France 's biggest stadium , in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;14	Balladur said the 80,000-seat Grande Stade , venue of the opening and final matches , will go under construction in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0221;15	It is scheduled for completion by the end of 1997 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;0	The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on Friday hailed the overwhelming Senate majority for a new trade pact as a `` triumph '' which would help make the world a more prosperous place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;1	`` This is a day for particular celebration , '' GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;2	`` The successful culmination of this debate proved that common sense still works . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;3	The U.S. Senate approved the GATT treaty by 76-24 votes late Thursday -- a much bigger margin than expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;4	The House of Representatives cleared the deal earlier in the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;5	Congressional approval , uncertain for weeks , was deemed crucial to the entry into force of the World Trade Organization Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;6	The new body will implement the new accord and have tougher powers than GATT to settle trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;7	`` I warmly welcome the vote by the U.S. Senate , '' said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , Europe 's chief negotiator in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;8	He said the 12-nation bloc would complete the approval process by Dec. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;9	France added a note of caution about a U.S. provision which would allow it to withdraw quickly from the WTO in the event of three adverse trade rulings deemed unfair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;10	France may now press the EU to take out a similar safeguard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;11	`` We have noted with satisfaction that Congress ratified the agreement , '' said a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman , speaking on the usual condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;12	`` We are nevertheless concerned with certain aspects of the American application . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;13	In Japan , Trade Minister Rytaro Hashimoto said U.S. ratification of the deal would encourage other countries to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;14	Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament passed the accord early Friday and it will now move to the upper house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;15	This view was echoed by Hong Kong 's Director-General of Trade , Tony Miller .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;16	`` The world looks to the United States for leadership in promoting free trade under the multilateral regime , '' Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;17	In Canberra , Austrlian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said the U.S. result was `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;18	Sutherland said he expected about 100 of GATT 's 124 member nations to ratify the trade accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;19	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to free world trade and is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;20	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;21	`` We will have a rules-based system that allows for the development of the world economy and provides an assurance of security , prosperity and reduction of tensions , '' Sutherland said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;22	` I celebrated last night , '' said the Irish lawyer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0222;23	`` It 's a triumph for the organization and the fact that people can react rationally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;0	Led by a sharp drop for cars and other transportation equipment , orders to U.S. factories fell in October for the first time in three months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;1	The Commerce Department said Friday that orders declined 0.4 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;2	But the government , which originally estimated orders to be down 0.2 percent in September , revised that figure to show a rise of less than 0.1 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;3	New orders , a key gauge of the nation 's manufacturing sector , have risen in 13 of the last 15 months including a 4.7 percent jump in August that was led by auto demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;4	They last fell in July , when they were off 2 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;5	Analysts expected orders to fall in October , predicting a decline of 0.6 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;6	Still , other data indicates the economy continues to grow at a solid pace despite higher interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;7	Earlier Friday , the Labor Department reported a sharp drop in unemployment to 5.6 percent for November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;8	But the government 's Index of Leading Economic Indicators , the government 's main forecasting gauge , was down 0.1 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;9	In the factory report , the Commerce Department said that -- excluding the volatile transportation component -- orders rose 0.9 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;10	That indicator was unchanged in September and has risen 16 times in the last 17 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;11	Orders for both durable and non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted dlrs 286 billion , down from dlrs 287.2 billion in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;12	Shipments , a measure of current production , decreased 0.7 percent to dlrs 284.2 billion in October , the third decline in the last four months and the fifth decrease this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;13	Shipments fell 0.7 percent in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;14	The backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.4 percent in October to dlrs 450.6 billion , following a 0.2 percent increase the previous month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;15	The orders backlog is often seen as a measure of whether current facilities and manpower are able to keep up with demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;16	Inventories in October rose 0.4 percent to dlrs 388 billion , after a 0.1 percent decrease in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;17	Orders for durable goods , items expected to last more than three years , were down 1 percent to dlrs 153.9 billion , after gaining 0.5 percent in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;18	Transportation equipment fell dlrs 3.4 billion or 8.8 percent , led by declining car demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;19	Orders for non-durable goods were up 0.2 percent at dlrs 132.1 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;20	Increased orders for tobacco , textiles and paper products were partly offset by declines in printing and publishing and petroleum and coal products .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;21	Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 0.1 percent in October after rising 3.5 percent in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0224;22	These orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand and modernize .
APW_ENG_19941202.0225;0	Stefan Edberg rallied after facing match-point in the final set Friday to beat Russian Alexander Volkov 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 and give Sweden a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0225;1	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0225;2	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;0	UNITA rebels were expected to arrive under U.N. protection in the Angolan capital Friday to cement a truce and power-sharing deal with the government that would end 19 years of civil war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;1	A United Nations plane was dispatched early Friday to an undisclosed location in the rebel-held Angolan hinterlands to pick up the UNITA delegation , a government military source told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;2	It would be the first time the rebels have appeared in Luanda since war resumed two years ago when UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- lost Angola 's first democratic elections and returned to arms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;3	The U.N. mission here set up stringent security measures after rebel representatives canceled a meeting earlier in the week , saying they feared for their lives in the government-held capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;4	The two sides were scheduled to begin work Saturday on practical implementation of a treaty their leaders signed two weeks ago in Lusaka , Zambia , said the military official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;5	At issue are security measures for rebel officials , withdrawal of troops from contested areas and transportation of government and rebel soldiers to demobilization centers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;6	Although both UNITA and the government have accused each other of violating a cease-fire called Nov. 22 , two days after the treaty was signed , there has been a general reduction in fighting across the war-ravaged nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;7	The U.N. mission here has deployed its first military observers to six scattered sites in the vast southern African nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;8	If the cease-fire holds , a 7,000-strong U.N. peace keeping force has been promised to secure Angola 's transition to peace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;9	Angola 's war , which erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 , has killed a half-million Angolans and left millions more threatened by starvation and disease .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;10	Peace accords in 1991 brought a brief respite but UNITA lost multiparty elections a year later , cried foul and returned to war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;11	After initially capturing more than two-thirds of the country , UNITA has recently suffered crushing defeats and rebel leaders have been on the run since their main base in the central city of Huambo fell to the government early November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0226;12	Rebel chief Jonas Savimbi has not been seen in public for months , prompting rumors he had been killed or wounded in a government attack , or that he was seriously ill and was being treated in Zaire or Morocco .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;0	Seventy Dutch U.N. peacekeepers detained by Bosnian Serb forces were released Friday , the Defense Ministry announced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;1	The peacekeepers , who were taken hostage Saturday near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia , left Bosnian Serb territory Friday morning for Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;2	The soldiers were in good condition , and none had been physically abused , the ministry said , adding that the soldiers would arrive back in the Netherlands Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;3	The release of the 70 peacekeepers left 20 still in Bosnian Serb custody in nearby Papraca .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;4	The Dutch peacekeepers were detained along with about 300 other troops , mostly British , as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0227;5	NATO warplanes struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on the Bosnian enclave of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;0	Police in the apartheid era killed and bombed government enemies and tried to spread the AIDS virus in the black community , the Sowetan newspaper reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;1	It based the reports on sworn affidavits it said were given by three policemen who were living in a European country under a witness protection program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;2	A judicial panel investigating political violence in South Africa has interviewed South African policemen in Denmark .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;3	The Sowetan report , citing confidentiality of the witness protection program , lacked the identities of the policemen , the country they were in and any information on how the newspaper obtained the affidavits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;4	Allegations of police hit squads date back years , and several judicial inquests have found evidence that some police took part in hit squads but never linked such activities to top officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;5	In addition , some policemen have been convicted of what appeared to be politically motivated killings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;6	The Sowetan report contained details of alleged police activities against black opposition groups that included : -- The 1988 bombing of the South African Council of Churches office in downtown Johannesburg .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;7	A former Cabinet minister allegedly congratulated the police unit involved ; -- Bombing cinemas to prevent the screening of the film `` Cry Freedom , '' which portrayed the relationship between black activist Steve Biko , who died in police custody , and a journalist ; -- Sending former guerrilla fighters infected with the HIV virus that leads to AIDS into the Hillbrow entertainment district of Johannesburg to infect black prostitutes ; -- Supplying arms to the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party , which fought a low-level civil war against the African National Congress that killed thousands of blacks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;8	-- Planning the killing of ANC and civil rights activist Bheki Mlangeni , who died when earphones he received in a mail package exploded as he used them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;9	There was no immediate comment from police or the Safety and Security Ministry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;10	Since the nation 's first all-race election in April ended apartheid and brought the ANC to power , President Nelson Mandela has called for reforms in the police department to bring blacks into the white-dominated hierarchy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;11	The ANC has for years accused police of aiding Inkatha in the political fighting that mostly stopped just before the election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;12	It also claimed police instigated violence to destabilize the black opposition movement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;13	The new ANC-led government has proposed granting amnesty to people who admit their roles in political crimes during the apartheid era .
APW_ENG_19941202.0228;14	Inkatha and the National Party , which implemented and dismantled apartheid during its 46 years in power until the April vote , oppose full public disclosure of details of the crimes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;0	In another sign Iran wants to influence the selection of a new spiritual leader for Shiite Muslims , a leading cleric said Friday the choice must be politically aware because Islam is under threat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;1	Grand Ayatollah Ali Araki died Tuesday at the age of at least 100 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;2	After his death , the jockeying began to replace him as supreme head of the world 's 100 million Shiite Muslims , who comprise one of Islam 's two main branches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;3	Traditionally the marja ala , or supreme spiritual leader , has been chosen from the grand ayatollahs -- who number about a dozen -- by theologians in the leading Shiite seminaries in Qom in Iran and the holy city of Najaf in Iraq .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;4	In the past , the marja ala has eschewed involvement in politics .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;5	But in a sermon broadcast on Tehran Radio Friday , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said the man who succeeds Araki `` must have a greater political awareness than previous holders of the office . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;6	Such a leader , he said , would help resurgent Islam face `` an American-backed Islam . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;7	Jannati is a member of key official committees and a close associate of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Iranian government 's choice for spiritual leader .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;8	His comments underlined fears among many Shiites that Iran 's government , by intervening in what has until now been a solely religious matter , is seeking to control religion in Iran and exert authority over Shiites around the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;9	Khamenei , 55 , has the qualifications of a middle-ranking cleric , but the radio referred to him as a grand ayatollah several times Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;10	There has been no official word that Khamenei had been promoted to grand ayatollah by Iran 's religious establishment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;11	Iran is promoting Khamenei because it fears that a non-Iranian , the Grand Ayatollah Ali Husseini Seestani , may become the next marja ala.
APW_ENG_19941202.0229;12	Seestani , 65 , who lives and teaches in Najaf in Iraq , has steered clear of politics .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;0	Nepal 's minority government is confident of winning the vote of confidence when Parliament meets in two weeks , the prime minister said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;1	The new communist government is required under the constitution to win the vote because it did not have the required majority in the 205-member House of Representatives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;2	`` I have talked to all the leaders of other political parties , '' Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;3	`` And they have assured us that they will cooperate . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;4	Adhikari needs at least 103 votes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;5	The main opposition Nepali Congress also said it will ensure that the government does not fail immediately .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;6	The Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Marxist-Leninist -RRB- won 88 votes , but cobbled together a government with the help of other groups .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;7	`` We need to win the confidence vote , pass legislations and the -LRB- annual -RRB- budget after that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;8	Therefore , it is a compulsion for us and also for them -LRB- other parties -RRB- to seek a consensus , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;9	The Nepali Congress won 83 seats , while the National Democratic Party won 20 seats , the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party four , Nepal Welfare Party three and independents seven seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0231;10	The pro-monarchy Democratic Party is undecided about supporting the government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;0	After a slow start , Haiti is moving swiftly to solidify its democratic institutions , appointing a new 11-member Supreme Court and formally placing the army-controlled police under civilian command .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;1	In another supportive step , 250 former Haitian boat people were heading home Friday to become members of the internationally supervised interim police force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;2	The separation of the police and military , stipulated in the 1987 Constitution , was approved by the Senate on Wednesday night but only announced on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;3	It will become law when it appears in the official government gazette , Le Moniteur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;4	`` The armed forces reform law is a historic break with our repressive political past , '' Sen. Jean-Robert Martinez told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;5	The appointment of new Supreme Court is another building block to establishing civil justice in a land that has been ruled by the gun for most of its history .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;6	The new chief justice , Clauzel Debrosse , had been an existing member of the Supreme Court but an opponent of the military overthrow in 1991 of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who returned to power in October after U.S. military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;7	`` We wanted to reward Debrosse for his opposition to de facto rule , '' said Martinez , an Aristide supporter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;8	Aristide , in conformity with the constitution , chose the judges from a Senate list of three for each seat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;9	The array of judicial moves reflects the desire by Aristide to strengthen civilian authority as rapidly as possible .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;10	Thousands of American and other foreign troops are guaranteeing the peace now , but U.S. Republican leaders are urging the Clinton administration to hasten the pullout of GIs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;11	The widely popular Aristide , wary of those who overthrew him three years ago , is quickly reassigning senior military officers to overseas posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;12	U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager confirmed Friday that former Haitian military chief Jean-Claude Duperval was being transferred to a diplomatic post in Brazil and Brig. Gen. Max Mayard was heading to a similar military attache position in Ecuador .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;13	The other two generals during the 1991-4 military rule , Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby , quit and fled to self-imposed exile in Panama two days before Aristide 's return .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;14	Aristide has pledged to slice the size of the army from 7,500 to 1,500 and to create a 4,000-member civilian police force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;15	The 250 Haitians joining the interim police force Friday were recruited and trained in the refugee tent camp at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;16	They were among tens of thousands of Haitians who fled their nation under military rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;17	Another 750 refugees-turned-police will arrive in Haiti in the next three weeks , Schrager , the U.S. spokesman , told the AP .
APW_ENG_19941202.0232;18	`` In coming weeks , they will be used in police support positions by both the Haitian government and the I.P.M. , '' said Paul Browne , spokesman for the 800-member 20-nation International Police Monitor corps that is supervising police work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;0	Nearly half a century after its launch , the Achille Lauro was drifting silently in the Indian Ocean on Friday , its history of triumphs and tragedy nearing an end .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;1	The 979 surviving passengers and crew members of the Italian liner were heading for three African and Middle Eastern ports aboard 10 rescue vessels after abandoning the blazing ship two days ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;2	Still smoldering , listing badly and charred from stem to stern , the Achille Lauro was but a shell of the gleaming blue and white luxury liner that once sailed around the world in 80 days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;3	But it was for tragedy , not triumph , that the Achille Lauro was best known .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;4	The ship burst into the world 's headlines in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked it , killed an American Jew , Leon Klinghoffer , and dumped his body overboard in his wheelchair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;5	The terrorists escaped from the ship and boarded a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were arrested and later tried .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;6	The second fire in the ship 's history began in the engine room before dawn Wednesday and slowly spread to engulf the ship , despite efforts by the crew to contain it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;7	Two elderly passengers died , one apparently of a heart attack , and eight people were injured as lifeboats and rafts were launched and the ship was abandoned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;8	The first fire aboard the Achille Lauro came in 1981 off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;9	Passengers leaped from the decks into the Atlantic and two died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;10	Wednesday 's `` fire was so big you had to fight through smoke which poured down toward the cabins , '' one survivor , Tony Webb , was quoted as telling the London Daily Telegraph .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;11	`` At about 8 a.m. , the captain said the fire was too strong and we would have to abandon ship , '' said Webb , 44 , a Briton living in Cape Town , South Africa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;12	Webb praised the crew and the ship 's captain , Giuseppe Orsi , who was the last to abandon ship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;13	But two other passengers , interviewed by Britain 's Sky TV on Friday , were critical .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;14	One , Geoffrey Wall , said one of the two victims was killed when the crew dropped an inflated raft on top of a lifeboat carrying about 35 passengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;15	And Dennis Basset told Sky TV that the crew failed to alert all of the passengers to the emergency until only minutes before the abandon ship order was sounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;16	In a radio telephone call from a rescue ship Thursday , Captain Orsi said he thought the Achille Lauro was finished .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;17	But an official of the ship 's owner , Starlauro of Naples , said Friday that seagoing tugs had been hired to go to the scene and check the ship 's condition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;18	`` We intend to tow the ship -- to save it at all costs , '' said Sergio Santopaolo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;19	But Santopaolo acknowledged the final decision will be made only after the tugboat crews evaluate the damage , and that would take at least a couple of days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;20	`` From what I saw , -LRB- the ship -RRB- is gone , '' Orsi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;21	Eight cargo vessels and two American warships , the USS Gettysburg and Halyburton , were carrying the Achille Lauro 's surviving passengers and crew members to Djibouti , Mombasa in Kenya and Muskat in Oman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;22	Most were heading for Mombasa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0233;23	The first ship was expected to dock in Djibouti on Saturday ; the rest were scheduled to make port on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;0	Arianespace , the world leader in commercial satellite launching , apologized Friday after a dlrs 150 million U.S. communications satellite crashed into Atlantic , but said the client has signed on for another try .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;1	Charles Bigot , Arianespace 's chief executive , said a failure in the third-stage engine caused an unmanned Ariane rocket to crash 15 minutes after takeoff Thursday from the launch center in French Guiana .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;2	Aboard was a sophisticated communications satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications of El Segundo , Calif. , for PanAmSat , a Greenwich , Conn.-based firm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;3	The PamAmSat-3 satellite would have channeled telephone , fax and television communications for most of North and South America , Europe and Africa over 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;4	It would have traveled in geostationary orbit over the mid-Atlantic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;5	Bigot , answering French reporters ' questions in a live hook-up from the launch center in South America , said it was too early to decide when Ariane launches would resume .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;6	He said preliminary report on the crash was due by mid-December .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;7	He said the lost satellite had been insured , and PanAmSat was preparing a replacement satellite .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;8	Despite the accident , Bigot said PanAmSat 's vice president , Reverge Anselmo , had signed a contract for Arianespace to launch another PanAmSat satellite by the end of 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;9	Arianespace technicians said the third-stage engine inexplicably lost pressure 218 kilometers -LRB- 135 miles -RRB- above Earth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;10	In January , a third-stage breakdown forced engineers to explode a rocket in mid-flight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;11	A Turkish and a European telecommunications satellites were also destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;12	Six perfect launches followed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;13	Thursday 's crash was the seventh in 70 launches since the European Space Agency 's commercial Arianespace program lifted off 15 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;14	It should not shake Ariane 's dominance as the world 's most successful launcher of lucrative private satellites -- the company now holds about 70 percent of the market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;15	`` We hope to get back into operation very quickly , '' said Bigot , who apologized to the satellite 's owners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;16	Liftoff was on schedule at 7:38 p.m.
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;17	The first two stages fired perfectly and controllers confidently expected another of what have become almost routine shots for the Ariane launchers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;18	The third stage also lit properly , but then mysteriously sputtered and went out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;19	Officials said that the third stage was a new type using a new oxygen-hydrogen mixture to maximize performance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;20	January 's accident was blamed on a turbo-pump failure freezing the third-stage rocket motor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;21	That failure followed 26 straight successful launches in which the European rocket distanced itself from its competitors , the United States and China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0234;22	The Arianes have put 94 satellites in orbit and have a backlog of 38 , representing contracts worth more than 17 billion francs -LRB- dlrs 3.1 billion -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;0	In an attempt to repulse incoming refugees , Parliament on Friday authorized the government to automatically bar all asylum seekers arriving overland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;1	The measure is aimed at stemming a flow of asylum seekers that has severely strained government resources and led to a rightist resurgence in May 's national elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;2	`` We do n't want to send people back to face danger , '' said spokesman Tom van der Maas for the right-wing Liberals , one of the three ruling coalition partners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;3	`` But we need to redirect this inflow of people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;4	It 's an effort to spread the burden throughout Europe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;5	`` This is an ugly law , '' countered Fronnie Biesma , spokesman for the Dutch Refugee Council .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;6	`` We are just transferring the responsibility to other countries . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;7	The legislation takes direct aim at the Netherlands ' international reputation as a safe haven for the persecuted , a label that this year will draw an estimated 55,000 asylum seekers to this nation of 15 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;8	Virtually assured of becoming law , the measure is aimed primarily at the `` economic migrants '' who move around Europe in search of the best residency and benefits deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;9	In practice , the law will bar the vast majority of asylum seekers , who usually arrive overland by bus , car or train from neighboring Germany or Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0235;10	The new law also would bar any asylum seekers who had traveled through so-called `` safe third countries '' where they could have applied for asylum before reaching the Netherlands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;0	Stocks were mostly higher in early trading Friday morning as bond prices staged a surprised rally on mixed economic reports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;1	After 30 minutes of trading the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 11.10 but it then lost all the gain to register 3,700.87 at 10.30 a.m. EST -LRB- 1530 GMT -RRB- one hour into the session , unchanged from Thursday 's close .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;2	Advancing issues led decliners by 789 to 664 on the New York Stock Exchange , where volume totaled 34.26 million shares in the first half hour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;3	Broad-market indexes were higher .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;4	The NYSE composite was up 0.61 at 246.65 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;5	The American Stock Exchange 's market value index was up 0.34 at 431.53 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;6	The Nasdaq composite index stood at 741.97 , up 0.78 from a revised Thursday close of 741.19 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;7	The Labor Department said a seasonally adjusted 350,000 new workers were added to the nation 's nonfarm payrolls , pushing the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;8	That is the lowest level since August 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;9	Analysts had expected an increase in nonfarm jobs of about 250,000 , and for the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;10	The jobs data showed a stronger-than expected growth in the economy , but its impact was softened by a drop of 0.1 percent in October in the government 's index of leading indicators , the chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;11	Bonds initially dipped on the jobs report but then quickly rallied , pulling stocks higher with them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;12	The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up about dlrs 6 per dlrs 1,000 face value and yielding 7.95 percent , after the market got mixed reports on the economy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;13	`` I 'm surprised , '' said Ricky Harrington , technical analyst at Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte , N.C. `` I thought the market would have been down 10-20 points '' on the jobs data .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;14	`` It could be we 've simply reached an oversold condition as far as bonds are concerned , and that might be the reason '' for the rally in both markets , Harrington said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;15	Harrington did note that average earnings and workweek fell , which could also have offered some comfort to bond traders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;16	Weak economic data is generally good for bonds because it lessens the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates to curb inflation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;17	Stocks were lower overseas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;18	Tokyo 's Nikkei index fell 0.1 percent , and Frankfurt 's DAX index was down 0.4 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0236;19	London 's FT-SE 100 was lower as well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;0	A prominent Russian historian said Friday that Kremlin archives from the 1950s show China and North Korea were sharply at odds over the number of American POWs they held during the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;1	`` Even the countries that fought together and held POWs in their camps in North Korea and China did n't know their exact number , '' said Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov , a historian and adviser to President Boris Yeltsin , told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;2	Volkogonov co-chairs the joint Russian-U.S. Commission , which is investigating the fate of American POWs and MIAs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;3	He said he would turn the document over to the American side at the commission 's session in Washington next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;4	Volkogonov cited an account he had found in the archives of a secret meeting in Moscow in the fall of 1952 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;5	Dictator Josef Stalin had summoned Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai , North Korean leader Kim Il Sung and North Korean military commander Pan Do Huai to the Kremlin to discuss the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;6	He asked how many Americans they had captured , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;7	`` Zhou Enlai replied that they held 8,000 foreigners , while Kim Il Sung immediately interrupted him , saying the actual number was slightly more than 4,000 , '' Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;8	`` Stalin tried to clarify that , but none of the participants in these secret talks could tell the exact number of United Nations ' POWs , much less American POWs . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;9	He suggested that China and North Korea help clarify the matter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;10	The Russian-U.S. commission announced last year there was no hope of finding any American POWs alive in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;11	It confined its search to finding the remains of U.S. servicemen and clarifying the circumstances of their deaths .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;12	The commission has also said it found no proof that any captured Americans were brought to the Soviet Union from Korea or Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;13	It did confirm that American POWs were interrogated by Soviet troops in North Korea and China during the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;14	The commission 's other co-chairman , Malcolm Toon , a former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union , has urged the Russians to continue searching archives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;15	Among the commission 's earlier findings were that several dozen Americans were sent to the Soviet Gulag after the Red Army freed them from the Nazis at the end of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;16	Soviet authorities arrested those with Slavic or Jewish surnames on assumption they were Russians who had collaborated with the Germans , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;17	`` The fates of some were so tragic they deserve to be told by Shakespeare , '' Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;18	He cited the case of one American , whom he identified only by the last name Oggins , who spent eight years in Soviet camps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;19	The man was finally shot on Stalin 's personal order in 1952 , days before his term was to expire , for fear he would tell the world what he had been through , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;20	Volkogonov said the commission also continues to investigate the fate of American pilots downed in the 1950s while probing the Soviets ' radar defenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0238;21	Earlier this year , the investigators found the remains of one , Capt. John P. Dunham , whose reconaissance plane was shot down by Soviet fighters over the Sea of Japan in 1952 , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;0	A jury convicted a Lebanese immigrant Thursday of murdering a Jewish teen-ager in an ambush on the Brooklyn Bridge , rejecting his claim that he was suffering a flashback from his childhood in war-torn Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;1	Rashid Baz , a livery cab driver , admitted he strafed the van with bullets on March 1 as it drove onto the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;2	Sixteen year-old Aaron Halberstam was killed and three others were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;3	Baz 's lawyer , Eric Sears , blamed his client 's `` catastrophic '' childhood in Beirut , where he became a soldier at age 9 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;4	He said Baz suffers post-traumatic stress syndrome , which climaxed in the bridge shooting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;5	Baz , 28 , said he fired at the van after its passengers mouthed insults and leveled a gun at him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;6	`` Let him rot in hell , '' Devorah Halberstam , the dead boy 's mother , said after the verdict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;7	`` Nobody believed he was insane .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;8	The evidence was overwhelming that he was not .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;9	... I honestly believe his only remorse is that he did n't kill every single boy in that van , '' Mrs. Halberstam said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;10	Nachum Sosonkin , 18 , a passenger who was shot in the head , testified during the trial that he never heard anyone inside the van say anything to Baz or display a gun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;11	The jury deliberated one day before convicting Baz of second-degree murder and 14 counts of attempted murder .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;12	Baz , who immigrated from Lebanon at age 18 , faces 25 years to life in prison at his Jan. 18 sentencing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;13	`` I do n't think my son got a fair trial , '' said Baz 's 52-year-old mother , Suheila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;14	`` The jury was very harsh . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;15	`` But I have high hopes in the American judge and I hope my son will get a fair sentence , considering his illness , '' she told The Associated Press in an interview at her apartment in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;16	She did not say what a fair sentence would be .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;17	The shooting occurred as 15 male students , dressed in the distinctive black garb worn by ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher Jews , returned from a visit to a Manhattan hospital where the Lubavitchers ' leader , Rebbe Menachem Schneerson , was being treated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;18	The rebbe died in June .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;19	The dead boy 's father , Rabbi David Halberstam , said he believes Baz acted to revenge the Feb. 25 massacre on Israel 's West Bank in which a Jewish settler killed 29 Arabs as they prayed in a mosque .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;20	Baz 's attorney had argued that the shooting was not revenge , but that the massacre might have triggered a deadly flashback .
APW_ENG_19941202.0239;21	The prosecution cited testimony by Baz 's uncle , Jamal Akel , that Baz 's problems predated the start of Lebanon 's civil war in 1975 and much of his behavior was shocking -- even in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;0	No sooner did a defense attorney try to quell one war of words in the murder case of former U.S. football great O.J. Simpson than another debate erupted involving judges in different states .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;1	A New York judge ordered one of Simpson 's DNA lawyers , Peter Neufeld , to appear in his court for a murder trial despite an order by the Simpson judge for Neufeld to be in Los Angeles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;2	The order Thursday by New York state judge Harold Rothwax included digs at Neufeld and the Superior Court Judge Lance Ito .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;3	`` I 'm out of sympathy for Mr. Simpson and his attorneys , '' said Rothwax , who claimed that Neufeld 's problems were his own fault and that Ito had waited too long to order the lawyer to appear at the Simpson trial .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;4	Rothwax 's order came hours after lead defense attorney Robert Shapiro said the Simpson team would stop talking to the press except `` when we feel there is a necessity . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;5	Simpson , a former football legend , television sports commentator and movie star , has pleaded innocent in the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman on June 12 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;6	Opening statements in his trial are n't expected until mid-January .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;7	Shapiro and attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. have accused Nicole Brown Simpson 's sister of orchestrating an effort to deny Simpson a fair trial by repeatedly accusing him of being the killer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;8	Prosecutor Marcia Clark responded that the families were fed up with defense attempts to discredit witnesses and evidence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;9	Ms. Brown 's emotional accusations continued to affect the trial Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;10	Three more prospective alternate jurors were bounced after they said they had heard or been told of her TV interviews .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;11	`` I think I heard Simpson ' sister-in-law say he was going to kill her ... Nicole , '' one prospect said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;12	Simpson appeared astonished , turned to his lawyers and asked , `` Did she say that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;13	Three other prospects who had heard of Ms. Brown 's comments were dismissed Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;14	The New York Daily News reported Friday that an inmate claims that he overheard Simpson make incriminating statements while talking to his friend Rosey Grier , a former football player who now is a minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;15	According to the newspaper , which cited an unidentified source , the inmate reported to a deputy that he overheard the conversation in a visiting room , which has several glass-enclosed cubicles that are open on top .
APW_ENG_19941202.0240;16	The deputy then notified Ito .

APW_ENG_19941202.0241;0	Later Friday , Russia 's Yevgeny Kafelnikov faced Magnus Larsson in the second singles with Swedes Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell , the ATP Tour 's top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned doubles champions , facing Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;1	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared enroute to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;2	But buoyed by a partisan crowd of 12,000 , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;3	The 27-year-old Volkov then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;4	Having broke Volkov to tie the set , Edberg had the added distraction Russian President Boris Yeltsin entering Olympic Stadium just as the Swede was preparing to start the next game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;5	Edberg , who had been whistled in derision by the crowd , paced along the baseline as Yeltsin and his entourage took their seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;6	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;7	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;8	A victory by Volkov would have been a major boost to the Russians , who were expected to have the edge in the match between Kafelnikov , ranked 11th by the ATP Tour , and Larsson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;9	Kafelnikov has won seven straight Davis Cup matches since losing in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;10	Sweden leads Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup competition , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;11	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title .
APW_ENG_19941202.0241;12	It is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;0	The mast on Isabelle Autissier 's yacht snapped in high winds Friday , knocking her out of the BOC Challenge round-the-world yacht race , the South African Press Association reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;1	Autissier , the only woman in the race and the leader after the first leg from Charleston , South Carolina , to Cape Town , sent a message to race headquarters in Charleston saying : `` Dismasted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;2	No danger immediately . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;3	An official in Charleston told SAPA the mast broke in winds of 40 knots -LRB- 46 miles per hour or 67 kilometers per hour -RRB- and Autissier , of France , would be unable to continue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;4	She was in fourth place on the second leg , 1200 miles -LRB- 1900 kilometers -RRB- from Cape Town en route to Sydney , Australia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0242;5	After Sydney , the 27,000-mile -LRB- 43,200-kilometer -RRB- race continues to Punta del Este , Uruguay , before finishing in Charleston in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;0	A prominent Russian historian said Friday that Kremlin archives from the 1950s show China and North Korea were sharply at odds over the number of American POWs they held during the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;1	`` Even the countries that fought together and held POWs in their camps in North Korea and China did n't know their exact number , '' said Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov , a historian and adviser to President Boris Yeltsin , told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;2	Volkogonov co-chairs the joint Russian-U.S. Commission , which is investigating the fate of American POWs and MIAs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;3	He said he would turn the document over to the American side at the commission 's session in Washington next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;4	Volkogonov cited an account he had found in the archives of a secret meeting in Moscow in the fall of 1952 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;5	Dictator Josef Stalin had summoned Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai , North Korean leader Kim Il Sung and North Korean military commander Pan Do Huai to the Kremlin to discuss the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;6	He asked how many Americans they had captured , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;7	`` Zhou Enlai replied that they held 8,000 foreigners , while Kim Il Sung immediately interrupted him , saying the actual number was slightly more than 4,000 , '' Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;8	`` Stalin tried to clarify that , but none of the participants in these secret talks could tell the exact number of United Nations ' POWs , much less American POWs . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;9	He suggested that China and North Korea help clarify the matter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;10	The Russian-U.S. commission announced last year there was no hope of finding any American POWs alive in the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;11	It confined its search to finding the remains of U.S. servicemen and clarifying the circumstances of their deaths .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;12	The commission has also said it found no proof that any captured Americans were brought to the Soviet Union from Korea or Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;13	It did confirm that American POWs were interrogated by Soviet troops in North Korea and China during the Korean War .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;14	The commission 's other co-chairman , Malcolm Toon , a former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union , has urged the Russians to continue searching archives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;15	Among the commission 's earlier findings were that several dozen Americans were sent to the Soviet Gulag after the Red Army freed them from the Nazis at the end of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;16	Soviet authorities arrested those with Slavic or Jewish surnames on assumption they were Russians who had collaborated with the Germans , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;17	`` The fates of some were so tragic they deserve to be told by Shakespeare , '' Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;18	He cited the case of one American , whom he identified only by the last name Oggins , who spent eight years in Soviet camps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;19	The man was finally shot on Stalin 's personal order in 1952 , days before his term was to expire , for fear he would tell the world what he had been through , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;20	Volkogonov said the commission also continues to investigate the fate of American pilots downed in the 1950s while probing the Soviets ' radar defenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0243;21	Earlier this year , the investigators found the remains of one , Capt. John P. Dunham , whose reconaissance plane was shot down by Soviet fighters over the Sea of Japan in 1952 , Volkogonov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;0	Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Friday downplayed hints by Syria 's leader that Damascus was losing hope in peace talks with Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;1	`` Be neither alarmed nor unmoved , '' by Hafez Assad 's comments , Rabin told newspaper editors meeting in Tel Aviv .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;2	He added the deadlocked peace efforts with Syria must continue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;3	Rabin said both Israel and Arab regimes were endangered by an Iranian-backed `` ugly wave of extremist , fundamentalist , terroristic Islam that has swept the Arab and Muslim world . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;4	Noting what he termed an upsurge in mosque construction in the United States and Western Europe , Rabin said : `` Today extremist Islam has an international infrastructure . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;5	He said most of the Israelis killed by Arabs since the Sept. 1993 autonomy pact with the PLO were victims of Palestinian fundamentalists , sometimes financed by supporters in the United States , or the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;6	Bloodshed in that time has claimed 94 Israelis and 187 Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;7	Rabin said Syria should follow the example of the PLO and Jordan , which both reached accords with Israel since Rabin took office in mid-1992 , in establishing a direct dialog with Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;8	But the Syrians can not be forced into peace , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;9	Rabin was responding to Assad 's statement Thursday that the status quo was preferable to formal peace under Israel 's conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;10	Israel and Syria have not fought directly for 21 years except for an air battle during Israel 's 1982 Lebanon invasion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;11	Both back proxy forces fighting in south Lebanon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;12	On Friday , Syria 's government-run Al-Thawra daily accused Israel of continuing to pursue `` war and aggression '' to intimidate the Arabs into peace on its terms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;13	`` If Syria really prefers the present situation over peace , peace can not be forced , '' Rabin said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;14	`` We can not force it on the Syrians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;15	The Syrians can not force it on us , and the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;16	understands that coercion and peace contradict each other . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;17	Israeli-Syrian negotiations have been deadlocked almost since they started in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;18	Syria demands that Israel return the entire Golan Heights captured in 1967 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;19	Israel has offered only a phased , partial pullback and also demands Syria dismantle Iranian-backed militias in Lebanon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;20	Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to return to the region Tuesday to resume his shuttle mediation between Damascus and Jerusalem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;21	Itamar Rabinovich , Israel 's U.S. ambassador and a leading negotiator with the Syrians , said it was up to Christopher to rescue the faltering peace process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;22	`` It is very important that he be successful in saving the gloomy atmosphere that has formed around the negotiations , '' Rabinovich said on Army radio .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;23	Rabin faces strong opposition in Israel to any peace deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;24	Benjamin Begin , a leading lawmaker from the right-wing Likud opposition , told Army radio that military intelligence believed Assad still sought Israel 's destruction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0244;25	`` Under such conditions , when this is the Syrian strategy , it is hard to understand why people with even minimal logic could even think about any withdrawal from the Golan , '' said Begin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;0	Author Robin Moore says he was surprised at how he easily obtained information in the former Soviet Union for his book about the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;1	Moore , 69 , the author of the `` French Connection '' and `` The Green Berets , '' spoke Thursday at the Litchfield-Morris Rotary about his latest novel , `` The Moscow Connection , '' which grew out of a 1991 visit to Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;2	`` I was fascinated to find a new era of free speech , '' Moore told the group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;3	`` It seemed everything could be bought and sold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;4	You could even buy the KGB -- I did . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;5	The latest book is a thinly disguised work of fiction chronicling the rise of the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;6	It was set in the wake of the failed coup that ended the reign of former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;7	The book grew out of an invitation by the Moscow police to do a positive story about the department .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;8	When he got there , Moore said , he found the department so riddled with corruption that a positive story was impossible .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;9	Instead , he made friends with some honest officers who steered him to his latest work with tales of the existence of a Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;10	Moore hopes his book will expose the burgeoning Russian mafia and what he says is its vigorous trade in the nuclear weaponry of the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0245;11	The Register Citizen newspaper in Torrington is serializing the novel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;0	The Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement Friday that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;1	A six-month war in 1991 -- at the start of the violent breakup of Yugoslavia -- left Serbs in control of one-third of Croatian territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;2	There have been thousands of skirmishes and larger confrontations between the two since a January 1992 ceasefire halted the war , including artillery duels southeast of Knin which continued for the third day Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;3	The economic agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;4	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;5	Representatives of the Croatian government signed the accord Friday morning at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , with international mediators Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg as co-signers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;6	The document was then brought to Knin , rebel Serb headquarters , where their leaders signed it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;7	`` The significance of the agreement is going to depend on the parties to the agreement , '' Owen told The Associated Press in Knin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;8	The two sides `` have it in their power to implement the agreement if they want to , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;9	`` For many people it has been senseless to be deprived of water , electricity , '' Owen said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;10	`` The basics of economic life can now be made available to all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;11	Croatian Serb representative Borislav Mikelic , though signing the agreement , remained firm in the Serbs ' refusal to accept any reintegration with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;12	`` By signing this agreement we once more proved that we are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis here and we also showed that we 're interested in the economic progress and economic opening to Europe and the world , '' Mikelic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;13	But he refused to discuss the crucial overall political solution , saying , `` This is not the time to talk about it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;14	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly , after a nearly eight-hour , closed-door session , approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;15	Negotiations between the two sides had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;16	But the Croatian Serbs relented after a recent clandestine meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , the Balkans power broker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;17	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since the 1992 cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;18	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941202.0246;19	This is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;0	Stefan Edberg rallied after facing match-point in the final set Friday to beat Russian Alexander Volkov 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 and give Sweden a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;1	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;2	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;3	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;4	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;5	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;6	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;7	I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;8	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;9	Later Friday , Russia 's Yevgeny Kafelnikov faced Magnus Larsson in the second singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;10	Swedes Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell , the ATP Tour 's top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned doubles champions , were to faced Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy on Saturday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0247;19	`` I saw a lot of people coming in , but I did n't know it was Yeltsin , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;20	`` I just put it aside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;21	I felt so happy being back in the match . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;22	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;23	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;24	A victory by Volkov would have been a major boost to the Russians , who were expected to have the edge in the match between Kafelnikov , ranked 11th by the ATP Tour , and Larsson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;25	Kafelnikov has won seven straight Davis Cup matches since losing in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;26	`` I 've been in the same situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;27	He 's probably feeling quite depressed tonight , '' Edberg said about Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;28	`` On the other hand , he was out of the match and came back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;29	Sweden leads Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup competition , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;30	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title .
APW_ENG_19941202.0247;31	It is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;0	Christianity is a `` lifeless corpse '' propped up by the Roman Catholic Church , a senior Iranian cleric said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;1	`` Today we look around and see that Christianity is truly lacking in divine and religious spirituality , and is an arid and useless movement , '' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in a sermon at Tehran University .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;2	It is `` a lifeless corpse propped up only by the institution of a centralized papacy , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;3	Jannati , a senior cleric inside the government , said `` Islam is experiencing a revival '' and possesses `` so much spirituality , so much depth , with such strength for administering the world . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;4	Officially , Iran respects both Judaism and Christianity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;5	But religious minorities in Iran , including a Christian population of about 200,000 , have been allowed to practice only under strict regulations and supervision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0248;6	Proselytizing by any religion or Muslim sect other than Iran 's brand of Shiite Islam is also strictly forbidden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;0	Serbs fired missiles at Bosnian government headquarters today in a sign of contempt for senior U.N. officials trying to end harassment of peacekeeping troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;1	The anti-armor missiles landed just before meetings began with the top U.N. official for former Yugoslavia , Yasushi Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;2	Akashi , on a mission to free hundreds of peacekeepers and end restrictions on U.N. relief convoys , was to talk later with the Serbs , who refused to even meet with his boss , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;3	After the rebuff , Boutros-Ghali warned that the intransigence of the warring sides in Bosnia threatened to force the United Nations to end its mission there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;4	The United Nations has pressing issues to discuss : attempts to calm fighting in northwest Bosnia , where Serbs forces have overrun Muslim villages in a U.N.-desigated `` safe area '' ; and the fate of more than 400 U.N. soldiers being held by the Serbs as insurance against NATO air strikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;5	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers who were taken hostage Saturday were released today , the Dutch Defense Ministry reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;6	The soldiers were in good condition and had not been physically abused .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;7	It was not immediately clear if the release was tied to Akashi 's mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;8	Akashi arrived this morning in Sarajevo for meetings with officials of the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;9	He left the presidency building briefly before the meetings began and the two missiles hit the structure just before he returned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;10	A third wire-guided anti-armor missile hit a building nearby .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;11	There were no immediate reports of injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;12	After the meetings with the government , Akashi was to head for talks at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , outside Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;13	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met with the U.N. commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose on Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;14	A U.N. source said Karadzic promised to try to help , but added that such promises often are empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;15	Spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi wanted to discuss fighting around the government enclave of Bihac in the northwest , and an end to restrictions on the movement of U.N. troops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;16	Thant said Bihac , scene of heavy fighting for weeks , was quiet overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;17	But strong Serb forces , which have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.N.-declared `` safe zone '' encompassing the town of Bihac and its environs , remained in the area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;18	The United Nations has said that ethnic Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia appeared strong enough to capture Bihac if they wanted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;19	There were signs that frontlines south of Bihac were also heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;20	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;21	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took the town from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;22	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Croatian Serb forces also had shelled his forces across the border near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;23	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;24	Seven more peacekeepers were seized Tuesday from an observation post in Croatia , across the border from Bihac , a U.N. spokesman said Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;25	Bosnian Serb units entered Croatia and took the Ukrainian soldiers and a U.N. armored carrier back into Bosnia , the spokesman , Alexander Ivanko , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;26	More than 400 U.N. soldiers are being detained by the Serbs to deter NATO air raids .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;27	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;28	The Serbs also have been refusing to let U.N. relief convoys pass through Serb-held territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;29	Monique Tuffelli , a staffer with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Bihac , said Thursday that food stocks would last only another week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;30	`` We have run out almost of everything , '' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;31	The Serbs repeatedly have rejected an international peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;32	With the threat of international force appearing to dissipate , their position is hardening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;33	Momcilo Krajisnik , leader of the Bosnian Serbs ' self-proclaimed legislature , rejected a three-month truce , which the Bosnian government wants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;34	He said Serbs would only accept a permanent cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;35	The Sarajevo government fears a permanent cease-fire would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;36	The peace plan the Serbs rejected would give them 49 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;37	Senior Western officials now talk of altering that plan to allow the Bosnian Serbs links with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0249;38	Opponents say that would be a step toward creation of Serb nationalists ' goal of a `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;0	Arianespace , the world leader in commercial satellite launching , apologized Friday after a dlrs 150 million U.S. communications satellite crashed into Atlantic , but said the client has signed on for another try .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;1	Charles Bigot , Arianespace 's chief executive , said a failure in the third-stage engine caused an unmanned Ariane rocket to crash 15 minutes after takeoff Thursday from the launch center in French Guiana .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;2	Aboard was a sophisticated communications satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications of El Segundo , Calif. , for PanAmSat , a Greenwich , Conn.-based firm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;3	The PamAmSat-3 satellite would have channeled telephone , fax and television communications for most of North and South America , Europe and Africa over 15 years , operating in geostationary orbit over the mid-Atlantic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;4	Bigot , answering reporters ' questions in a live hook-up from the launch center in South America , said it was too early to decide when Ariane launches would resume .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;5	He said a preliminary report on the crash was due by mid-December .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;6	He said the lost satellite had been insured , and PanAmSat was preparing a replacement satellite .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;7	Despite the accident , Bigot said PanAmSat had signed a contract for Arianespace to launch another satellite by the end of 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;8	`` While we are disappointed , PanAmSat has always recognized the risks inherent to this industry , '' said Fred Landman , PanAmSat 's president .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;9	`` PanAmSat 's aggressive recovery plan reflects our commitment to provide high-quality satellite international services to our customers as soon as possible . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;10	Arianespace technicians said the third-stage engine inexplicably lost pressure 218 kilometers -LRB- 135 miles -RRB- above Earth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;11	In January , a third-stage breakdown forced engineers to explode a rocket in mid-flight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;12	A Turkish and a European telecommunications satellites were also destroyed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;13	Six perfect launches followed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;14	Thursday 's crash was the seventh in 70 launches since the European Space Agency 's commercial Arianespace program lifted off 15 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;15	It should not shake Ariane 's dominance as the No. 1 launcher of lucrative private satellites -- the company now holds about 70 percent of the market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;16	`` We hope to get back into operation very quickly , '' said Bigot , who apologized to the satellite 's owners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;17	Liftoff was on schedule , and the first two stages fired perfectly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;18	The third stage also lit properly , but then mysteriously sputtered and went out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;19	Officials said that the third stage was a new type using a new oxygen-hydrogen mixture to maximize performance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;20	January 's accident was blamed on a turbo-pump failure freezing the third-stage rocket motor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;21	That failure followed 26 straight successful launches in which the European rocket distanced itself from its competitors , the United States and China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0250;22	The Arianes have put 94 satellites in orbit and have a backlog of 38 , representing contracts worth more than 17 billion francs -LRB- dlrs 3.1 billion -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;0	Liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have taken a new settlement plan for the failed bank to a Luxembourg court , court officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;1	Judge Maryse Welter is to rule Jan. 12 on the plan to repay 250,000 creditors and depositors around the world some dlrs 10 billion , said court registrar Maryse Schumacher .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;2	A creditors ' committee approved the plan in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;3	It would provide dlrs 1.8 billion from the bank 's majority shareholders , the government and ruling family of Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;4	Liquidators say the plan could repay creditors 30 to 40 cents on the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;5	But many depositors worry their savings have disappeared in legal costs during the four years it has taken to wind up the bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;6	An earlier settlement plan for BCCI depositors was shot down by a Luxembourg judge last year as too favorable to Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;7	Abu Dhabi was to have paid dlrs 1.7 billion into a fund for creditors in the earlier deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;8	The new deal increases the amount of money and changes the wording to accommodate what technical objections raised by the judges last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;9	Schumacher said no creditors opposed the plan during two days of court hearings Wednesday and Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;10	But a lawyer for Luxembourg 's banking supervisors , the Luxembourg Monetary Institute , argued against what it considers is still too easy a deal for Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;11	Banking regulators closed BCCI branches around the world in July 1991 , leaving claims of about dlrs 10 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0251;12	Officials alleged BCCI was used to launder money for drug dealers and dictators around the globe , but some of the depositors who lost their money blame the troubles on lax regulation by the authorities , including the Bank of England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;0	Russian lawmakers trying to end a standoff in Chechnya accused their own government today of sending warplanes to attack the breakaway republic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;1	President Boris Yeltsin 's government has denied providiny military support to rebels trying to topple Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev , even as the rebel offensive has escalated from small-arms fire to bombs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;2	Defense Minister Pavel Grachev says Russian mercenaries are fighting on both sides in Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;3	But Dudayev , who declared independence for his tiny Caucasus Mountain republic in 1991 , flatly accuses Moscow of leading and arming the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;4	Air raids on the outskirts of Grozny , the Chechen capital , continued for a fourth day today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;5	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , Yeltsin 's former social welfare minister and one of four members of a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;6	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;7	Other members of the delegation , which met briefly with Dudayev , demanded an end to the air strikes , warning that the conflict could spiral out of control .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;8	The lawmakers were trying to negotiate the release of about 70 Russians -- said to include Russian soldiers and officers -- captured in the fighting in Chechnya , a mostly Muslim republic in southern Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;9	Since the rebels ' air offensive began last week , thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;10	Chechen officials said there was a new round of air raids early today east of Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;11	Dudayev said his home was bombed Thursday , but that claim could not be immediately verified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;12	Moscow does not recognize the independence of Chechnya , which became part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century after a series of long and bloody wars .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;13	Yeltsin threatened Tuesday to send in troops unless the fighting had stopped by Thursday , but when the deadline expired he said Chechen fighters would be given amnesty if they put down their weapons by Dec. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;14	Still , there were media reports of Russian troop buildups near the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;15	`` Chauvinist forces in Russian are pushing President Yeltsin to act , saying he can not control ` little ' Chechnya , '' warned Vladimir Lysenko , a member of the parliamentary delegation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;16	Although Russian ultranationalists constantly lament the loss of Moscow 's empire , a recent opinion poll showed that most Russians are ready to let the Chechens go their own way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0252;17	Lysenko warned that the conflict is endangering the lives of as many as 150,000 ethnic Russians in Chechnya .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;0	World champion Jansher Khan stayed on course for his seventh title of the season Friday when he beat England 's Del Harris in the semi-finals of the dlrs 96,000 Qatar International .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;1	Khan , determined to win the Qatar tournament for the third successive year , totally outclassed Harris , the world ranked 20 , 15-4 , 15-3 , 15-10 in just 36 minutes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;2	In Saturday 's final , Khan will take on Australia 's Rodney Eyles , world ranked as No. 54 , who defeated England 's Chris Walker in the day 's second semi-final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;3	`` I 'm playing better and better every day , '' said Khan , who has won the World and British Opens this year as well as tournaments in Hong Kong , Japan , Portugal and Austria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;4	During 1994 , Khan has only lost once and that was at the start of the year against Scotland 's Peter Nicol at the Welsh Classic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;5	`` I can be beaten but it will take a lot of hard work , '' said the Pakistani .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;6	Eyles took 54 minutes to beat the sixth-ranked Walker 15-13 , 10-15 , 15-12 , 15-9 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;7	Eyles can take comfort from being one of the few men to have beaten Khan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;8	The Australian pulled off a remarkable victory at the 1993 Portuguese Open coming from two games behind and two match balls down to win .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;9	`` I 've played Jansher a few times , '' said Eyles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;10	`` I will try and cut out my rate of errors in the final . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0254;11	Added the Australian , `` I will have to play well both in retrieving and attacking . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0257;0	U.S. congressional clearance of a new world trade accord is expected to encourage ratification by other countries , allowing the mammoth export-boosting pact to take effect as planned on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;1	Large and small nations alike are trying to rush the 22,000-page GATT agreement through national parliaments , often in low-key processes compared to the rocky ride through Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;2	Nearly 40 countries , including the United States , have now ratified the 124-nation agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;3	About 40 more -- including Japan , the European Union and Canada -- have said they will do so by year 's end .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;4	The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , Peter Sutherland , said Friday that U.S. passage was a `` triumph '' that will help make the world a more prosperous place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;5	`` This is a day for particular celebration , '' GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland told journalists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;6	`` The successful culmination of this debate proved that common sense still works . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;7	France added a note of caution about a U.S. provision which would allow it to withdraw quickly from the WTO in the event of three adverse trade rulings deemed unfair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;8	France may now press the EU to take out a similar safeguard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;9	`` We have noted with satisfaction that Congress ratified the agreement , '' said a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman , speaking on the usual condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;10	`` We are nevertheless concerned with certain aspects of the American application . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;11	The U.S. Senate approved the GATT treaty by 76-24 votes late Thursday -- a much bigger margin than expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;12	The House of Representatives cleared the deal earlier in the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;13	Congressional approval , uncertain for weeks , was deemed crucial for the the World Trade Organization to take effect on Jan. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;14	The WTO will implement the new accord and have more powers than GATT to settle trade disputes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;15	`` I warmly welcome the vote by the U.S. Senate , '' said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , Europe 's chief negotiator in the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;16	He said the 12-nation bloc would complete the approval process by Dec. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;17	In Japan , Trade Minister Rytaro Hashimoto said U.S. ratification of the deal would encourage other countries to follow suit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;18	Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament passed the accord early Friday and it will now move to the upper house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;19	This view was echoed by Hong Kong 's Director-General of Trade , Tony Miller .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;20	`` The world looks to the United States for leadership in promoting free trade under the multilateral regime , '' Miller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;21	In Canberra , Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said the U.S. result was `` great news for Australia and the world economy generally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;22	Sutherland said he expected about 100 of GATT 's 124 member nations to ratify the trade accord by the end of the year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;23	The agreement is considered the most ambitious attempt ever to knock down barriers to free world trade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;24	The pact is expected to boost global income by dlrs 510 billion by the year 2005 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;25	It reduces customs duties on hundreds of thousands of products , liberalizes trade in service industries , protects against copyright theft and patent abuse and cuts protection of farm goods and textiles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0257;26	`` We will have a rules-based system that allows for the development of the world economy and provides an assurance of security , prosperity and reduction of tensions , '' Sutherland said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;0	A man threatening to detonate a bomb in a Ukrainian nuclear power plant unless unless he received dlrs 1 million has been arrested , a security service spokesman said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;1	The man , described only as `` Slav and young , '' was captured Thursday night after two days of telephone negotiations with `` high-level officials '' said Viktor Varenyk , Security Ministry press officer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;2	Varenyk said intelligence officers had so far failed to find any explosives in any of Ukraine 's five nuclear power plants , but had treated the threats as serious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;3	The incident was similar to a threat to blow up Lithuania 's main nuclear power plant earlier in November , unless a dlrs 8-million ransom was paid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;4	The Ignalina plant was shut down , but no explosives were found .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;5	One man was arrested for that blackmail attempt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;6	The suspect captured in Kiev was taken into custody after police traced a telephone used by the caller , security officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;7	His capture came only hours before he was due to board a Lufthansa flight to Europe where a police trap had been laid for him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;8	Ukrainian state television showed pictures of a sealed box , said to contain over dlrs 650,000 , and cut diamonds valued at dlrs 350,000 being emptied from a Lufthansa bag .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;9	The blackmailer had demanded to be flown to western Europe together with the loot .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;10	Officials did not disclose where the explosives were alleged to have been planted , but the closest nuclear power station to Kiev is Chernobyl , site of the world 's worst nuclear power accident in 1986 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;11	Dozens of people died in the aftermath of an explosion in one of the plant 's four reactors and environmental groups say thousands have died since from fall-out of the radioactive cloud that swept across European nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;12	The director of Chernobyl , Sergei Parashyn , told The Associated Press that security had been increased and the search was continuing for suspicious devices .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;13	`` You know what happens in Chechnya with kidnaps and ransom demands , so anything is possible , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0258;14	Security at the station has been criticized as lax following the theft of ten nuclear fuel rods earlier this year .

APW_ENG_19941202.0261;0	A substantially bigger-than-expected gain in construction employment helped force the U.S. unemployment rate down two-tenths of a percent in November to the lowest level in four years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;1	The Labor Department said a seasonally adjusted 350,000 new workers were added to the nation 's nonfarm payrolls , pushing the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;2	That is the lowest level since August 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;3	Labor Secretary Robert Reich called the report `` great news '' and evidence of a continued strong economic recovery .

APW_ENG_19941202.0261;13	The nation 's nonfarm payrolls have increased by 2.6 million people this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;14	The report suggests the economy is still growing at a robust pace and employment growth remains strong .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;15	However , the government 's chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity pointed in the other direction , falling in October for the first time in 15 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;16	The Index of Leading Economic Indicators slipped 0.1 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;17	In another report , the government said orders to U.S. factories fell in October for the first time in three months , led by a sharp drop for cars and other transportation equipment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;18	In advance of the unemployment report , most economists were expecting the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 percent and nonfarm payrolls to increase by about 250,000 workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;19	Even the most optimistic analysts were expecting an increase no bigger than 280,000 jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;20	Strong employment growth this year was one of the factors that prompted the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates last month for a sixth time this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;21	Last month , the central bank raised key rates three-quarters of a percentage point , the largest increase in 13 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;22	Higher interest rates are meant to curb inflation , which bothers investors because it lowers the value of their holdings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;23	Marilyn Schaja , an economist with Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette Securities in New York said the report could provide impetus for another round of interest rate increases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;24	She said with the unemployment rate as low as it is `` we are going to see some inflationary pressures . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;25	The large number of new hires was boosted by unexpectedly robust growth in construction employment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;26	The Labor Department said 71,000 jobs were added to construction industry payrolls in November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;27	Katharine G. Abraham , commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , said construction employment benefited from the return of some construction employees in the Southeast who had been unable to work because of heavy rains in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;28	A modest 4,000 construction jobs were added in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;29	Manufacturing employment also was robust , jumping 51,000 after increases of just over 18,000 in the previous three months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0261;30	Abraham said gains were recorded in manufacturing of durable goods , including lumber , fabricated metals , industrial machinery and electronic equipment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;0	Volkwagen 's worldwide sales are up 7.1 percent in the first 10 months of this year but the automaker is still in early stages of its rebuilding , managing board chief Ferdinand Piech said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;1	`` We have made about 20 percent of the improvements that we set as our goal , '' Piech told financial analysts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;2	`` In costs and quality clear progress has been attained , but there still is a lot of work ahead of us to be in the lead in worldwide competition . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;3	Volkwagen released Piech 's comments in a statement that put world sales at 2.75 million vehicles through 10 months of 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;4	The statement did not refer directly to German media reports that Germany 's biggest car maker was still planning large staff cuts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;5	The company put most of its workers in Germany on a four-day work week early this year , in a pact to avoid big layoffs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;6	On Thursday , VW denied it was planning to dismiss 50,000 workers worldwide to get down to a payroll of 194,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0262;7	Piech told the analysts that VW 's planning is dynamic and is reviewed annually .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;0	The U.S. dollar , riding on bullish economic news , on Friday breached the key 100-yen mark for the first time in seven weeks , and rose through the day against most other major currencies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;1	Mid-afternoon , the dollar traded at 100.39 yen , compared with 99.58 yen at the close in Tokyo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;2	London traders said better-than-expected news on U.S. employment raised expectations of that the Fed will raise interest rates , helping to strengthen the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;3	`` The implication is that U.S. rates will go up again in January or February , '' said Stewart Frost , an analyst at Natwest Markets in London .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;4	The U.S. Labor Department announced the unemployment rate down two-tenths of a percent in November to the lowest level in four years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;5	A total of 350,000 new workers were added to the nation 's nonfarm payroll .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;6	`` The market was expecting the figure to be about 200,000 , '' Frost added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;7	`` Also , the price of U.S. Treasury Bonds is holding up , suggesting they are undervalued . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;8	Keith Edmonds at IBJ international in London , said the dollar would likely `` struggle to move too far above the 100-yen level , especially if we do n't see any move by the Fed this month on interest rates . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;9	The dollar also rose against other currencies during European trading .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;10	These are the afternoon rates , compared with late Thursday : -- 1.5805 German marks , up from 1.5743 -- 1.3345 Swiss francs , up from 1.3310 -- 5.4225 French francs , up from 5.3985 -- 1.7687 Dutch guilders , up from 1.7610 -- 1,620.90 Italian lire , up from 1.617.00 -- 1.3725 Canadian dollars , down from 1.3751 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;11	The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.5591 , dowm from 1.5655 late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;12	London 's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of dlrs 378.95 per ounce at midmorning , down from the closing price of dlrs 379.75 bid per ounce Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0263;13	In Zurich , the bid price was dlrs 378.65 , down from dlrs 379.75 late Thursday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0263;15	Silver traded in London at dlrs 4.91 a troy ounce , unchanged from late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;0	Stefan Edberg rallied after facing match-point in the final set Friday to beat Russian Alexander Volkov 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 and give Sweden a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;1	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;2	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;3	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;4	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;5	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;6	Later Friday , Russia 's Yevgeny Kafelnikov faced Magnus Larsson in the second singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;7	Swedes Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell , the ATP Tour 's top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned doubles champions , were to faced Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;8	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared enroute to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;9	But buoyed by a partisan crowd of 12,000 , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;10	The 27-year-old Volkov then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;11	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;12	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;13	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;14	Having broke Volkov to tie the set , Edberg had the added distraction Russian President Boris Yeltsin entering Olympic Stadium just as the Swede was preparing to start the next game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;15	Edberg , who had been whistled in derision by the crowd , paced along the baseline as Yeltsin and his entourage took their seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;16	`` I saw a lot of people coming in , but I did n't know it was Yeltsin , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;17	`` I just put it aside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;18	I felt so happy being back in the match . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;19	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;20	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;21	A victory by Volkov would have been a major boost to the Russians , who were expected to have the edge in the match between Kafelnikov , ranked 11th by the ATP Tour , and Larsson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;22	Kafelnikov has won seven straight Davis Cup matches since losing in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;23	`` I 've been in the same situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;24	He 's probably feeling quite depressed tonight , '' Edberg said about Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;25	`` On the other hand , he was out of the match and came back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;26	Sweden leads Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup competition , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;27	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title .
APW_ENG_19941202.0264;28	It is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;0	Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Warren of the Seattle Seahawks was arrested after a car he was driving crashed into a utility pole , injuring him and two teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;1	One player , recently acquired defensive tackle Michael Frier , was critically hurt .

APW_ENG_19941202.0266;3	Frier has a severe neck injury and was listed in critical condition early Friday , said team orthopedic surgeon Pierce Scranton .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;4	He would not say if Frier was paralyzed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;5	Warren , who suffered two cracked ribs , was treated and released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;6	Smith had chip fractures in his spine and ankle and was hospitalized overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;7	Warren , driving a Chevy Blazer -- a small truck-like vehicle , was arrested at the scene for investigation of vehicular assault , Sgt. Mark Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;8	Smith said it appeared Warren was driving too fast for the rain-slicked road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;9	The crash set the utility pole on fire and the players had to be pulled from the vehicle by passersby and firefighters , Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;10	Police would not comment on whether drugs or alcohol were involved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;11	Warren was released on his own recognizance , police dispatcher Jill Roberts said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;12	The accident happened about 8:40 p.m. near the team 's training center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;13	`` You read about it , you hear about it , but when it happens to somebody very close it really is a shock , '' Seahawks coach Tom Flores told KIRO radio early today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;14	`` It 's something that we all have to keep praying for that they all recover . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;15	The power line suspended on the pole was severed in the collision , causing a large electrical flash and disabling three substations , said Kristen Wappler , a spokeswoman for Puget Sound Power and Light Co.
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;16	The accident knocked out electricity to some 4,500 Puget Power customers for about an hour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;17	Warren , a fifth-year , Pro Bowl running back , is the first Seahawks player to rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;18	He started this week as the second-leading rusher in the American conference with 1,096 yards , just 5 yards behind San Diego 's Natrone Means .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;19	He also is second in the AFC in total yards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;20	The Seahawks play Indianapolis Sunday in the Kingdome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;21	The accident was the latest in a number of auto accidents involving NFL players this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;22	Dallas offensive lineman Erik Williams was lost for the season when he tore knee ligaments in an Oct. 24 crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;23	Williams pleaded no contest to drunken driving .
APW_ENG_19941202.0266;24	Teammate Shante Carver , a defensive end , also was involved in an accident in October when his speeding truck crashed into a concrete retaining wall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;0	The U.S. Postal Service on Friday defended its stamp recalling the atomic bombing of Japan saying that it could not omit such a major event from its World War II history series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;1	The stamp , showing a mushroom-shaped cloud rising from an atomic blast , is one of a set of 10 stamps marking major events of 1945 to be sold on a sheet titled `` 1945 : Victory at Last . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;2	Forty stamps have already been issued in similar sets for the 50th anniversary of the 1941-44 war years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;3	But the atomic bomb stamp is drawing sharp criticism in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;4	Sunao Tsuboi , acting director of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-bomb Survivors Organizations , termed it `` outrageous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;5	Japan surrendered Aug. 15 , 1945 , days after atomic bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;6	`` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 , '' says the caption on the mushroom cloud stamp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;7	Postal Service spokesman Robin Wright said the World War II series was developed in cooperation with the State and Defense departments to assure historical accuracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;8	As far as the atomic bomb stamp , he said , `` we would be remiss in omitting such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic bomb . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;9	`` Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of events of World War II , and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events , '' Wright added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;10	Other stamps in the 1945 set picture U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima , `` Okinawa , the last big battle , '' liberations of Manila and of Holocaust survivors in Europe , Germany 's surrender at Reims , refugees uprooted by war and U.S. celebrations of Japanese surrender .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;11	The 1941 set , titled `` A World at War '' included stamps showing Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill framing the Atlantic Charter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0267;12	The 1944 set , titled `` Road to Victory '' included the allied Normandy landings , the liberation of Rome and the battles of Leyte Gulf in the Pacific and the Bulge in Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;0	Police have seized 16 tons of raw material for the production of drugs and arrested an unspecified number of people , including pharmaceutical managers , police officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;1	The material was bound for illegal laboratories abroad where they were supposed to be used for the production of drugs , among them Rohypnol , a sedative used by drug addicts in the west .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;2	According to published reports , local police have been working for several weeks with West European experts before they cracked down on the drug ring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;3	But police officials were tight-lipped , referring to an ongoing investigation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;4	During the swoop , a group of high-ranking officials of the state-run pharmaceutical producer Sopharma , including manager Anton Petrov , were detained .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;5	So were executives of a private company reportedly involved in selling the drugs abroad .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;6	Also in custody was a customs official , newspapers said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;7	She was said to have prepared the documents necessary for export .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;8	According to media reports , police also arrested two Dutch citizens belived to be part of a ring trying to smuggling the material abroad .
APW_ENG_19941202.0268;9	The amount of chemicals already smuggled out of the country was not known .
APW_ENG_19941202.0269;0	Adolphe Sax , the saxophone inventor whom President Clinton paid tribute to in June , is being honored here starting Saturday with fanfare marking the centennial of his death .

APW_ENG_19941202.0269;3	Sax , who died Feb. 7 , 1894 in Paris , unveiled the revolutionary new instrument in 1844 to great critical acclaim .
APW_ENG_19941202.0269;4	Music critics said its rich and varied sounds captured the emotional inflections of the human voice better than any other instrument .
APW_ENG_19941202.0269;5	The saxophone has been a longtime favorite among jazz buffs , including Clinton , who made an unscheduled detour to Sax 's birthplace in Dinant , Belgium , three days after D-Day celebrations in France last June .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;0	Joe Montana said a published report of his retirement from the National Football League is wrong , and he angrily criticized the media for reporting an unsubstantiated story .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;1	`` It 's ridiculous , '' the Kansas City quarterback said Friday at Arrowhead Stadium during his weekly news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;2	`` I had n't heard about it until I got here today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;3	I think , first of all , you guys are going to start having to stand up for what you write .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;4	It hurts the credibility of your field . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;5	The New York Daily News reported Friday that Montana would retire at the end of the NFL season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;6	The newspaper quoted unidentified league sources and did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;7	There was no answer at newspaper 's sports department this morning when an attempt was made to get comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;8	Montana sprained a foot in Sunday 's loss to Seattle and rumors started that he would be out for a lengthy period and would not be back next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;9	`` I 've got a sprained ankle and some guy writes that I 'm retiring , '' Montana said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;10	`` I had a hangnail last week and he did n't write about that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;11	`` It 's irritating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;12	It 's irritating that you have to put people through this .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;13	It 's irritating that I should have to stand up here and go through this , '' Montana said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;14	He said chances are `` pretty slim '' that he will be able to play against Denver Sunday in Kansas City .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;15	He said the ankle feels better but is still sore .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;16	Asked earlier about the New York Daily News report , Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore said that Montana has always said he would make no decision until after the end of the season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;17	Moore said `` it is just natural that from now until the end of the season there will be all kinds of speculation about Montana 's future plans . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;18	Montana , 38 , spent 14 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and helped them win four Super Bowls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;19	After playing just one game in 1991 and 1992 , he was traded to Kansas City in April , 1993 , along with safety David Whitmore and a third-round draft pick in exchange for a first-round draft choice that the 49ers later traded away .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;20	Montana was reported to have considered retirement last season after sustaining a concussion in Kansas City 's AFC championship game loss in Buffalo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0270;21	Until last Sunday , this season was relatively injury-free for Montana .
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;0	Pope John Paul II on Friday urged Roman Catholic bishops in Iran to perservere in the faith despite the difficulties they face .
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;1	Without mentioning Iran 's fundamentalist Muslim government , the pope said he was aware that the bishops ' pastoral work '' often is difficult and regularly hindered for different reasons tied to the present situation . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;2	He exhorted the visiting bishops of Tehran and Isfahan to '' keep alive the presence of the Church . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;3	Catholics in Iran number about 12,000 , out of a Christian population of 200,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;4	Also Friday , a senior Iranian cleric said in a sermon in Tehran that Christianity is a '' lifeless corpse propped up only by the institution of a centralized papacy . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;5	Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said the Christian religion is '' truly lacking in divine and religious spirituality . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0272;6	Christians in Iran practice under close supervision and strict regulation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;0	Negotiators trying to save the North American ice hockey season season kept bargaining Friday following an eight-hour session that apparently made progress on some of the key issues in the 63-day lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;1	National Hockey League Management and player union representatives resumed negotiations at a downtown hotel , mindful that a labor agreement probably will have to be in place within two weeks to salvage a 50-game season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;2	`` I do n't know about a Dec. 15 deadline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;3	Negotiations are ongoing , '' union head Bob Goodenow said after the sides exchanged proposals Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;4	`` People have to deal with the realities of the situation , and we 're working on that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;5	Neither side would characterize the talks , but a source told the Canadian Press the session was `` good , but not great . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;6	Among the issues discussed were a rookie salary cap , salary arbitration and free agency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;7	But the major obstacle , the luxury tax , was apparently set aside for the moment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;8	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman did not speak to reporters following the meetings Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;9	`` He 's feeling a little bit exhausted right now because they worked very hard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;10	Both sides worked hard , '' league spokesman Arthur Pincus said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;11	`` Talking is the only way to make a deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;12	So talks continuing has to be taken as that all by itself .

APW_ENG_19941202.0273;14	Since the owners locked out the players Oct. 1 , the season has been pared to 60 games , with 24 games stripped from each team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;15	CP reported the union has dropped its desired salary ceiling to dlrs 1.25 million from dlrs 1.5 million for first-round players , while the NHL remained at dlrs 700,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;16	On salary arbitration , the NHL wants to retain its right to have an arbitrator 's decision to be non-binding on the team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;17	Rather than paying the awarded salary , a team could allow the player to become an unrestricted free agent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;18	The league also proposed that only two players per team per year be eligible for salary arbitration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;19	The NHLPA wants arbitration to be binding .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;20	The two sides agreed that , in an arbitration case , an unrestricted free agent 's contract can not be used to provide comparisons and arrive at a decision , a source told CP .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;21	On free agency , both sides agreed that players shall become unrestricted free agents upon reaching age 28 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;22	Each team would be allowed to designate one player as a franchise player .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;23	The NHL Players Association agreed to this proposal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;24	The franchise player could be kept three years beyond his 28th birthday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0273;25	The owners want the franchise player to be the highest-paid player on the team , while the NHLPA 's position is that the franchise player would be any player earning the average of the top 26 salaries in the league -- about dlrs 3 million a season .

APW_ENG_19941202.0280;1	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;2	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;3	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;4	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;5	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;6	Later Friday , Russia 's Yevgeny Kafelnikov faced Magnus Larsson in the second singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;7	Swedes Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell , the ATP Tour 's top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned doubles champions , were to faced Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy on Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;8	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared enroute to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;9	But buoyed by a partisan crowd of 12,000 , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;10	The 27-year-old Volkov then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;11	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;12	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;13	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;14	Having broken Volkov to tie the set , Edberg had the added distraction of Russian President Boris Yeltsin entering Olympic Stadium just as the Swede was preparing to start the next game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;15	Edberg , who had been whistled in derision by the crowd , paced along the baseline as Yeltsin and his entourage took their seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;16	`` I saw a lot of people coming in , but I did n't know it was Yeltsin , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;17	`` I just put it aside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;18	I felt so happy being back in the match . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;19	Considering the outcome , `` maybe I should thank Boris for coming in , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;20	Volkov did not blame Yeltsin for his loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;21	`` I could n't have failed to notice when the president arrived , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;22	`` -LRB- But -RRB- I can say it interfered with my game as much as rain outside would have , because I had lost my serve by then . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;23	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;24	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;25	A victory by Volkov would have been a major boost to the Russians , who were expected to have the edge in the match between Kafelnikov , ranked 11th by the ATP Tour , and Larsson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;26	Kafelnikov has won seven straight Davis Cup matches since losing in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0280;27	`` I 've been in the same situation .

APW_ENG_19941202.0280;30	Sweden leads Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup competition , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0290;0	The leader of Quebec 's separatist movement is recovering from surgery to amputate his left leg and is out of danger , a hospital official said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0290;1	Lucien Bouchard , a central and charismatic leader of the separatist bloc , had the leg amputated Thursday , two days after being hospitalized for a blood clot that became infected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0290;2	Robert Racine , deputy director of Saint-Luc Hospital , denied rumors Friday that Bouchard had taken a turn for the worse .

APW_ENG_19941202.0290;6	Bouchard 's emergency hospitalization throws into doubt the role the Bloc Quebecois leader will play in next year 's critical referendum on separation .

APW_ENG_19941202.0290;9	Bouchard 's doctor , Patrick D'Amico , said in a statement that the separatist leader developed an infection on his leg after being hospitalized on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0290;10	`` This situation necessitated two operations to drain and amputate the leg and control the infection , '' said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0290;11	The rapidly-spreading flesh-eating disease is caused by a virulent form of streptococcus bacteria that enters the body through a cut or a wound and produces an infection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0290;12	Widely considered the most compelling Quebec separatist leader , the charismatic Bouchard 's absence from the upcoming referendum battle would be a blow to forces seeking Quebec 's secession .

APW_ENG_19941202.0293;4	`` The armed forces reform law is a historic break with our repressive political past , '' Sen. Jean-Robert Martinez told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;5	The appointment of new Supreme Court is another building block to establishing civil justice in a land that has been ruled by the gun for most of its history .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;6	The new chief justice , Clauzel Debrosse , had been an existing member of the Supreme Court but an opponent of the military overthrow in 1991 of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who returned to power in October after U.S. military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;7	`` We wanted to reward Debrosse for his opposition to de facto rule , '' said Martinez , an Aristide supporter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;8	Aristide , in conformity with the constitution , chose the judges from a Senate list of three for each seat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;9	The array of judicial moves reflects the desire by Aristide to strengthen civilian authority as rapidly as possible .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;10	Thousands of American and other foreign troops are guaranteeing the peace now , but U.S. Republican leaders are urging the Clinton administration to hasten the pullout of GIs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;11	The widely popular Aristide , wary of those who overthrew him three years ago , is quickly reassigning senior military officers to overseas posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;12	U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager confirmed Friday that former Haitian military chief Jean-Claude Duperval was being transferred to a diplomatic post in Brazil and Brig. Gen. Max Mayard was heading to a similar military attache position in Ecuador .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;13	The other two generals during the 1991-4 military rule , Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby , quit and fled to self-imposed exile in Panama two days before Aristide 's return .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;14	Aristide has pledged to slice the size of the army from 7,500 to 1,500 and to create a 4,000-member civilian police force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;15	The 250 Haitians joining the interim police force Friday were recruited and trained in the refugee tent camp at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;16	They were among tens of thousands of Haitians who fled their nation under military rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;17	Another 750 refugees-turned-police will arrive in Haiti in the next three weeks , Schrager , the U.S. spokesman , told the AP .
APW_ENG_19941202.0293;18	`` In coming weeks , they will be used in police support positions by both the Haitian government and the I.P.M. , '' said Paul Browne , spokesman for the 800-member 20-nation International Police Monitor corps that is supervising police work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;0	IAAF president Primo Nebiolo indicated Friday his federation is prepared to share some of its revenues from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics to help promote track and field in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;1	`` If the Olympics give us the means , and I believe they will , we will use whatever we get to help the United States , '' Nebiolo said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;2	`` We want to create a great project in the United States because it has the most fantastic athletes in the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;3	This is a nation that should be our athletics locomotive . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;4	Nebiolo said any form of aid would be decided in concert with USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic Committee .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;5	Nebiolo did not specify how he would help , but International Amateur Athletic Federation spokesman Christopher Winner said the world body could contribute some of its Olympic television and sponsorship revenues to assist USA Track and Field .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;6	`` It 's an IAAF Marshall Plan , '' Winner said , referring to the massive U.S. aid project for Europe after World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;7	Although many of the world 's top track and field stars are Americans , the sport has suffered from a lack of exposure and popularity in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;8	On another issue , Nebiolo said the timetable for track and field events in Atlanta was still under study and no fixed date had been set to annouce the schedule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;9	The timetable has been held up by debate over the timing of the men 's marathon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0294;10	The IAAF wants to start the race in late afternoon to culminate with the Games ' closing ceremony , but several runners and medical experts have said it would be hazardous to compete at that hour in Atlanta 's notorious heat and humidity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;0	Most of the 608 passengers aboard the Cebu City were sleeping when a freighter slammed into the ferry Friday in Manila Bay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;1	The ferry sank a half hour later , a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;2	At least 34 people drowned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;3	Of the 100 still missing , an unknown number went down with the ship , lying under 30 meters -LRB- 90 feet -RRB- of water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;4	Divers could see their bodies but could not get to them before dark when the search for survivors was called off for the night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;5	`` Suddenly we heard a crash , '' Erwin Maravilla said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;6	`` I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;7	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;8	His wife also was among the missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;9	Ships in the area plucked 451 people from the sea , many coated with the diesel oil disgorged as the ferry sank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;10	The freighter , the Singapore-registered Kota Suria , joined in the rescue effort , its bow badly bent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;11	Survivors complained the crew did little to save people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;12	The radio room may have been severely damaged because the distress signals came from other ships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;13	Maximo Calamba , who was rescued with his wife and 1-year-old son , said he heard many cries for help .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;14	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;15	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;16	The collision occurred before dawn near the town of Rosario , about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;17	The freighter , five times the ferry 's size , destroyed the bridge and tore a gaping hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;18	The captain and his mates were in the bridge , the control section of the ferry , said one crewman , Jacob Cabatuan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;19	They were among the missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;20	The cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies , is under investigation .

APW_ENG_19941202.0295;22	Danny Dalugdog , a driver and bodyguard , was separated from his wife and 3-month-old son in the confusion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;23	`` I thought they were gone . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;24	But he found his wife on the freighter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;25	Then , as they transferred to a coast guard ship to return to Manila , a passenger called out that he found a baby boy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;26	`` It turned out to be my son , '' Dalugdog said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;27	A coast guard spokesman , Lt. Cmdr. Amado Samante , said 451 passengers had been rescued and 34 bodies recovered , many children and women .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;28	`` There were more bodies inside the cabins , '' said Angel Espidido , a coast guard diver .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;29	Divers could see the dead through the portholes but were unable to open the doors late Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;30	`` Tomorrow we will go back to unlock them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;31	Cargo containers and rubber rafts floated in the sea , but many survivors apparently never got a chance to use them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;32	`` I was jolted by the crash and I woke up , '' said Melissa Selosia , who was on her way to going to Mindanao Island , 780 kilometers -LRB- 485 miles -RRB- south of Manila for Christmas with her four children .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;33	`` I grabbed a life jacket and made for the upper deck and then I jumped into the water . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;34	She said she swam as quickly as possible from the sinking ferry , recalling her seaman husband 's words that a sinking boat will suck down everything around it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;35	The ferry 's owner , the William Lines shipping company , said 608 people were on board .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;36	The accident coincided with the company 's initial public stock offering Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;37	The ferry , which can carry 800 people , was en route to Tagbilaran , capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0295;38	The worst peacetime ferry disaster occurred in the Philippines in December 1987 when 4,341 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;0	The Achille Lauro sunk off East Africa Friday as a tugboat was preparing to tow away the charred cruise liner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;1	The ship , which was listing in waters off Somalia , went under at 1610 gmt , or 7 p.m. local time , said Italian coast guard Lt. Francesco D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;2	He said the ship was not recoverable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;3	'' She was hooked up to the -LRB- tug -RRB- Solano and in 10 minutes , she collapsed -- pfft , she disappeared , '' said Antonio De Rosa , marketing director for Achille 's owner , Starlauro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;4	'' She was already in bad condition , '' he said , adding it was not immediately clear what caused the ship to go down so suddenly .

APW_ENG_19941202.0296;6	The Italian coast guard in Rome has been coordinating rescue operations after the ship caught fire en route to South Africa Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0296;7	Starlauro had hired sea-going tugs to bring the Achille Lauro home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;0	Swedish divers prowled inside the sunken ferry Estonia for the first time Friday , finding decks `` demolished '' after the ship 's 60-meter plunge to the Baltic Sea floor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;1	Maritime authorities declined to say whether the divers found any bodies in the wreck , where an estimated 800 people were entombed when the ferry sank on Sept. 28 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;2	`` It 's extremely demolished , '' Swedish maritime administration spokesman Lars-Goran Bronow told the news agency TT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;3	`` It happened when the ship turned upside down . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;4	The ferry sank in about 30 minutes after a storm ripped off its front cargo door .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;5	Investigators say it capsized and probably rolled over completely before hitting bottom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;6	It now lies on its side 56-84 meters -LRB- 180-280 feet -RRB- under water off Finland 's southwestern coast .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;7	Divers had examined two of the ship 's six decks as of Friday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;8	Weather permitting , teams of six divers plan to work in shifts around the clock for four days surveying the ship 's interior , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;9	They will work their way into the bridge , where authorities hope to retreive navigational computers and other records that might provide clues about what happened , Bronow said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;10	`` The weather conditions are good .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;11	The weather wo n't hinder the work , '' Bronow told TT earlier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;12	Working in near-freezing water , the divers ' mission is to gather evidence to help authorities decide whether to raise the ship , retreive the bodies or take some other action .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;13	Of the estimated 1,049 people on the ferry , 137 survived , according to the latest figures published Friday by the Finnish police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;14	Only 94 bodies have been recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;15	The rest are believed in the ship , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;16	Authorities said they will not disclose any divers ' information about bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;17	Each diver was required to sign a contract barring him from describing the scene to anybody but investigators and officials , Swedish media reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;18	`` -LRB- This -RRB- mission does not include bringing anybody to the surface , '' Swedish Communications Minister Ines Uusmann told the newspaper Aftonbladet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;19	Swedish authorities hope to decide on a course of action by mid-December , and were focusing on several options .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;20	In one , salvagers could scour the wreck to retrieve all the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;21	They also could leave all the bodies and fill the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;22	The divers are working from a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;23	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed because the ships apparently had been given the wrong coordinates for the wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0297;24	The Swedish government , meanwhile , said Friday it has decided to give 3 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 417,000 -RRB- to organizations helping victims ' families , in many cases including orphans .

APW_ENG_19941202.0300;0	President Clinton 's administration said on Friday it has no evidence that PLO elements controlled by Yasser Arafat have been involved in terrorist attacks on Israelis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;1	In a report to Congress on PLO compliance with the peace agreement with Israel , the State Department said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization `` both in its words and deeds is negotiating in good faith and is demonstrating that it recognizes Israel 's right to exist .

APW_ENG_19941202.0300;5	The report said Arafat has assured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of his commitment to amend the covenant `` but did not present a definitive timetable . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;6	Congress required the administration to report every six months on the progress of PLO compliance with its commitments to renounce terrorism , amend its covenant , and end the economic boycott of Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;7	The report said that during the past six months groups opposed to the peace process -- Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad -- `` have launched a concerted effort to undermine negotiations by killing Israelis and discrediting the authority and effectiveness of the Palestinian Authority . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;8	During that period 39 Israelis have been killed , six of them in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority .
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;9	`` These terrorist groups do not belong to or operate under the control of the PLO and have openly opposed Arafat because of his commitment to make peace with Israel , '' the department said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;10	It said the PLO has `` moved to condemn terrorist attacks in a more timely , direct and authoritative manner . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;11	But it also said the Palestinian police `` have not been as effective as they could be , in particular in terms of following up detentions with effective investigations , actual prosecution and incarceration of those responsible . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;12	It also said that `` the Palestinian police have not been effective in locating terrorist operatives who are organized in small compartmented cells . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0300;13	As for the economic boycott , the report said that the PLO has `` signed a detailed economic protocol with Israel which represents a de facto reversal of the PLO 's traditional support for the boycott . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0306;6	`` I do n't know about a Dec. 15 deadline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;7	Negotiations are ongoing , '' union head Bob Goodenow said after the sides exchanged proposals Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;8	`` People have to deal with the realities of the situation , and we 're working on that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;9	Neither side would characterize the talks , but a source told the Canadian Press the session was `` good , but not great . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;10	Among the issues discussed were a rookie salary cap , salary arbitration and free agency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;11	But the major obstacle , the luxury tax , was apparently set aside for the moment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;12	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman did not speak to reporters following the meetings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;13	`` He 's feeling a little bit exhausted right now because they worked very hard .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;14	Both sides worked hard , '' league spokesman Arthur Pincus said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;15	`` Talking is the only way to make a deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;16	So talks continuing has to be taken as that all by itself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;17	I do n't want to characterize it any more than that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;18	Since the owners locked out the players Oct. 1 , the season has been pared to 60 games , with 24 games stripped from each team .

APW_ENG_19941202.0306;20	On salary arbitration , the NHL wants to retain its right to have an arbitrator 's decision to be non-binding on the team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;21	Rather than paying the awarded salary , a team could allow the player to become an unrestricted free agent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;22	The league also proposed that only two players per team per year be eligible for salary arbitration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;23	The NHLPA wants arbitration to be binding .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;24	On free agency , both sides agreed that players shall become unrestricted free agents upon reaching age 28 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0306;25	Each team would be allowed to designate one player as a franchise player .

APW_ENG_19941202.0307;5	De Rosa valued the loss at dlrs 25 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0307;6	The Achille Lauro 's captain , aboard the oil tanker Hawaiian King , told the Italian news agency ANSA by radio phone he was '' very sorry '' about the news .
APW_ENG_19941202.0307;7	'' I knew that by now she was unseaworthy , but what happened has greatly displeased me , '' Giuseppe Orsi said . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0310;0	Serbian police have arrested 156 ethnic Albanians , all former police officers , in the restive Kosovo province , the public prosecutor announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0310;1	In the first official confirmation of the crackdown over the past ten days , Serbian prosecutor Miodrag Brkljac said the ethnic Albanians were members of an illegal group which planned `` armed rebellion against '' Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0310;2	It was the biggest police raid in Kosovo since 1989 when Serbia revoked the autonomy of its southern province , where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 1.9 million population .
APW_ENG_19941202.0310;3	Serbian police now keep a firm grip on any ethnic Albanian dissent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0310;4	Ethnic Albanian officials , who have formed a parallel structures in Kosovo , staunchly deny that they plan any armed rebellion against Serbia , saying that would be against their peaceful resistance policy .

APW_ENG_19941202.0310;7	An independent Serbian human rights organization protested the arrests , saying they show that `` the regime is suppressing the alternative government in Kosovo by violating human rights and intimidating citizens . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0311;0	Human rights groups sharply criticized Russian authorities Friday for carrying out a Turkmen request to detain a leading dissident .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;1	The Federal Counterintelligence Service last week detained Murad Esenov , a correspondent for Radio Liberty and prominent Turkmen activist living in Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;2	Human rights groups linked Esenov 's detention to a recent crackdown on opposition activity by Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;3	According to the group Human Rights Watch-Helsinki , Niyazov called for the arrest and repatriation of several leading critics , including Esenov , in order `` to neutralize the activities of the traitors of the homeland . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0311;6	Acting Russian Prosecutor General Alexei Ilyushenko confirmed that Esenov was detained after a delegation from Turkmenistan came to Moscow with a request for his arrest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;7	But , Ilyushekno told a news conference , the request was not properly documented , and Esenov was only being detained while an investigation is carried out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;8	Ilyushenko said there were no immediate plans to send Esenov and several other detained Turkmen dissidents back home .

APW_ENG_19941202.0311;10	They have not been arrested , they have been detained , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;11	The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said Esenov had received phone threats saying that if he did not stop his dissident activity he would be deported to Turkmenistan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;12	Russia 's constitution forbids extraditing anyone for political activity , but if Turkmen authorities can provide evidence of criminal offenses , Esenov and the other dissidents may be sent back .
APW_ENG_19941202.0311;13	Once back in Turkmenistan , the dissidents could face the death penalty .

APW_ENG_19941202.0311;15	After a referendum last January , he will be allowed to remain in office until June 21 , 2002 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0313;4	Claes told reporters after a meeting here of foreign ministers from NATO and former East bloc nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0313;5	Christopher told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0313;6	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them `` and we continue to police the no-fly zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0314;0	Nick Faldo of England shot eight birdies Friday for a record-tying 64 and a seven-stroke lead after two rounds of the Million Dollar Challenge golf tournament .

APW_ENG_19941202.0314;3	Like in the first round , Faldo 's precision kept him out of trouble and set up repeated birdie putts with the cross-hand grip adopted in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;4	He made eight birdies for the second straight day , and shot par the rest of the way to improve over the first-day 66 that included two bogies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;5	`` That was the best nine holes I have ever played , '' Faldo said of back nine , when he birdied five straight holes and two others for a 29 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;6	`` I 'm going off now to find some starch and spray myself to see if I can stay in this mode , '' he joked , adding : `` This is as good as I have ever played .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;7	Perhaps my swing had a little more zip in 1989 , but technically I am a better player now . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;8	Price , the world 's top rated player this year and defending champion , came back from a poor-putting first round 71 to fire a six-under 66 , while Langer followed his first day 68 with a three-under 69 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0314;11	Seve Ballesteros of Spain at 147 and Vijay Singh of Fiji at 153 brought up the rear .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;12	Faldo said he intended to keep playing aggressively despite his large lead in the 12-player tournament that includes 11 of the 20 top rated golfers in the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;13	`` I ca n't afford to get too defensive or some of these guys can shoot a great round and get within a couple of shots tomorrow , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;14	But Price , who was back using his favorite putter that was repaired after breaking in transit , gave himself only an `` outside chance '' of closing the gap .
APW_ENG_19941202.0314;15	`` Faldo is going to have to make some mistakes before anyone can catch him , '' Price said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0317;1	School officials at the Kristinehamn high school in central Sweden accepted her resignation saying `` teachers are not allowed to strip during class , '' the Aftonbladet newspaper reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;2	Irene Wachenfeldt , 44 , was teaching a group of adult , unemployed women how important it is to love your own body .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;3	To drive home the point , the mother of five undressed , the report said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;4	`` My body is good enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;5	I want you to feel the same about your bodies , '' she was quoted as telling her class .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;6	Students wrote a letter to the school principal protesting the decision to fire Wachenfeldt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;7	`` It was one of our best lessons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0317;8	... It helped boost our self confidence , '' student Jenny Berg was quoted as saying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;0	A beautiful Russian Orthodox cross an Idaho man secreted out of the communist country 27 years ago is returning to the faithful in Boise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;1	`` It really needs to go home , '' Quinten Crockett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;2	`` It means a lot to me .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;3	But it means more to them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;4	On Sunday , Crockett will give the cross to the St. Seraphim of Sarov Russian Orthodox Church in Boise during a special service .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;5	`` The cross in our church is a very powerful symbol of our victory over sin , '' said the Rev. David Moser , St. Seraphim 's minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;6	`` We tend to look at things that have survived the ravages of times and persecutions as kind of special .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;7	They are a symbol of our ability to overcome trial . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;8	Crockett bought the cross on the Russian black market 27 years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;9	A man approached him with an offer to sell religious icons , but only for American money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;10	They agreed on a purchase price : $ 10 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;11	The cross 's history is uncertain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;12	But many similar icons were taken from Russian Orthodox churches and hidden during the Russian Revolution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;13	Tiny figures in relief depict the crucifixion of Christ .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;14	On the back are words scratched in old Slavic , a language all but gone in Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;15	Crockett knew all religious materials were considered property of the state and would be confiscated when he left the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;16	But he outsmarted border guards by stuffing the 18-inch icon down his pants and covering the top with his untucked shirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;17	Crockett kept the cross as a memento of his trip and of the people he met in the Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;18	`` The same spirit I feel in the Mormon Temple , I felt in the Orthodox churches , '' said Crockett , who is LDS .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;19	The cross is believed to have come from a small country church .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;20	`` And it 's going to go to a little church , '' Crockett said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;21	`` It 's time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0318;22	It 's like if someone had an old , original Book of Mormon and was n't sharing it with anyone . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;0	Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard had his left leg amputated after being attacked by a strain of flesh-eating bacteria , but is out of danger , doctors said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;1	Bouchard , who heads the Bloc Quebecois , the main opposition party in Canada 's parliament , was reported in serious condition by officials at Montreal 's Saint-Luc hospital following surgery Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;2	Hospital deputy director Robert Raciot said Friday that reports that the 55-year-old Bouchard was on the verge of death were untrue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;3	His doctor , Patrick d'Amico , said Bouchard underwent three operations Tuesday to combat the rapid spread of necrotizing fasciitis , a virulent form of streptococcus bacteria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;4	The bacteria enter the body through a cut or a wound .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;5	He now faces three or four months rehabilitation , doctors said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;6	Bouchard vowed in a letter to his supporters that he will continue his political career .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;7	News of Bouchard 's illness shook Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;8	Small groups of people , some bearing Quebec flags , kept an all-night vigil outside the hospital under a light snowfall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;9	The fledgling Bloc Quebecois became the official opposition in Ottawa after last year 's federal election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;10	The party , devoted to independence for French-speaking Quebec , won 54 out of 75 seats in the province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;11	Since then , Bouchard has played a powerful role as the separatist standard-bearer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;12	The separatist government in Quebec , which came to power this fall , has promised to hold a referendum on independence next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;13	But the leadership Bouchard was expected to provide in the campaign is now in doubt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;14	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , in Paris for a summit on AIDS , said it was a time to put political differences aside and express `` our personal solidarity with the suffering of a fellow human being . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;15	Dr. Michel Poisson , head of microbiology at Montreal 's Hotel-Dieu hospital , said doctors would have to wait 24 to 48 hours after the surgery to make sure they had removed all infected flesh .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;16	The flesh-destroying bacteria have been linked to about a dozen recent deaths in Britain and elsewhere .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;17	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates there are 500 to 1,500 cases of deadly strains of the bacteria in the United States each year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0319;18	The fatality rate is about 30 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;0	Nepal 's minority government is confident of winning the vote of confidence when Parliament meets in two weeks , the prime minister said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;1	The new communist government is required under the constitution to win the vote because it did not have the required majority in the 205-member House of Representatives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;2	`` I have talked to all the leaders of other political parties , '' Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;3	`` And they have assured us that they will cooperate . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;4	Adhikari needs at least 103 votes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;5	The main opposition Nepali Congress also said it will ensure that the government does not fail immediately .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;6	The Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Marxist-Leninist -RRB- won 88 votes , but put together a government with the help of other groups .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;7	`` We need to win the confidence vote , pass legislations and the -LRB- annual -RRB- budget after that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;8	Therefore , it is a compulsion for us and also for them -LRB- other parties -RRB- to seek a consensus , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0320;9	The Nepali Congress won 83 seats , while the National Democratic Party won 20 seats , the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party four , Nepal Welfare Party three and independents seven seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia were meeting Friday to discuss new ideas for peace in Bosnia , including a suggestion of a confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations gathered after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;2	Thus , Christopher sought to heal a rift with NATO allies France and Britain over the alliance 's use of force in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;3	On a visit to the NATO headquarters Thursday , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said he endorsed a confederation of Bosnian Serbs with neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;4	`` We do support the suggestion -LRB- of -RRB- an unambiguous recognition '' of Bosnian Serbs ' right to forge political links with the government in Belgrade , Kozyrev told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;5	He met here with Christopher in the margin of a NATO meeting before going over to the EU headquarters for the Contact Group talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;6	A U.S. official said Christopher 's `` understanding of Foreign Minister Kozyrev 's position is very clear , '' but that a Bosnian Serbs-Serbia political alliance was `` not a proposal we support at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;7	Also attending the meeting were Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe , the British and French foreign ministers who will go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;8	The Contact Group , officials said , hoped to launch a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;9	It was expected to call for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities across Bosnia for up to six months , followed by an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;10	On offer for the Bosnian Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , would be an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;11	Hurd said this week that would not amount to giving in to Serb aspirations of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;12	The current peace plan , that Bosnian Serbs have rejected , envisions a confederation between Croatia and the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;13	The core of the peace plan Bosnian Serbs have rejected is a division of Bosnia that would required them to return much territory they have seized in battle .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;14	The Contact Group meeting caps an eventful week in which U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali failed in his bid to meet with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Kardazic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;15	More than 400 of the 24,000 U.N. soldiers in Bosnia are being detained by the Serbs as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0321;16	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;0	World champion Jansher Khan stayed on course for his seventh title of the season when he beat England 's Del Harris on Friday in the semifinals of the dlrs 96,000 Qatar International .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;1	Khan , seeking to win the Qatar title for the third straight year , routed Harris , the world 's No. 20 , 15-4 , 15-3 , 15-10 in just 36 minutes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;2	In Saturday 's final , Khan will play Australia 's Rodney Eyles , world ranked No. 54 , who downed England 's Chris Walker in the other semifinal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;3	`` I 'm playing better and better every day , '' said Khan , who has won the World and British Opens this year as well as tournaments in Hong Kong , Japan , Portugal and Austria .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;4	During 1994 , Khan has only lost once and that was at the start of the year against Scotland 's Peter Nicol at the Welsh Classic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;5	Eyles took 54 minutes to beat the sixth-ranked Walker 15-13 , 10-15 , 15-12 , 15-9 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0323;6	Eyles can also take comfort from being one of the few to have beaten Khan , having done so at the 1993 Portuguese Open by coming from two games behind and two match balls down to win .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;0	U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali met with the Turkish Cypriot leader Friday in continuing efforts to reunite Cyprus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;1	Rauf Denktash told reporters after the 50-minute meeting that he understood Boutros-Ghali would instruct his representative on the divided Mediterranean island to organize fresh talks between the opposing Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;2	`` We are ready to continue the talks ... with political equality and Swiss-like sovereignty , '' said Denktash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;3	Denktash met informally with President Glafcos Clerides , leader of the majority Christian Greeks , five times this fall as part of a confidence-building exercise to gain each other 's trust .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;4	They were the first meetings between the two leaders in a year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;5	Cyprus was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup by supporters of a union with Greece .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;6	Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway republic in the north in 1983 , but only Turkey recognizes it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0324;7	The main sticking points are the Turkish Cypriot demand for recognition of their breakaway state , and their rejection of the U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the withdrawal of some 35,00 Turkish troops and 50,000 mainland settlers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;0	Befitting her royal title , the Duchess of York on Friday opened the Frankfurt Equestrian International by arriving in a horse-drawn carriage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;1	Stopping in Germany on her way back to Britain from Australia , the duchess spent the day surrounded by two of her great passions , children and horses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;2	The former Sarah Ferguson began the day at a Christmas market in the center of Frankfurt , appearing on behalf of a new German children 's charity , People in Need , and promised to spend more time in Germany promoting children 's causes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;3	Sarah was greeted by children lining the equestrian ring when she arrived at the horse-jumping competition 30 minutes late .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;4	`` One of my great loves is riding and horse-jumping , '' the duchess told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;5	`` Maybe next year I 'll come into this competition as long as they keep the fence very small , '' she joked .
APW_ENG_19941202.0325;6	Sarah returned to Britain Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;0	An anti-abortion activist who killed a doctor and his escort in a shotgun attack was sentenced by a federal judge on Friday to life in prison .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;1	The judge sentenced Paul Hill to two life terms for violating the new federal clinic protection law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;2	Hill faces the death penalty when he is sentenced Tuesday in state court for the same shootings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;3	Hill , 40 , showed no emotion as U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson handed down the life sentences and a 10-year sentence for wounding a third victim .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;4	The sentences are to run concurrently .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;5	Dr. John Bayard Britton , 69 , and retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett , 74 , died in the shotgun attack July 29 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;6	Barrett 's wife , June , 69 , was wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;7	Hill was the first person convicted of violating the new federal abortion clinic protection law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;8	Vinson also ordered Hill to serve an additional five years in prison for firearm violations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;9	Hill represented himself at both his state and federal trials , offering no evidence and declining to question witnesses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;10	He was not allowed to argue that the murders were justifiable homicide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;11	Hill told the judge Friday that he shot the doctor because `` I was trying to prevent Dr. Britton from killing the 30 people he was going to kill that day . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;12	He has argued that killing of abortion providers is justified to prevent abortions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;13	Vinson said he did not doubt Hill 's sincerity about believing he had a higher motive , but disagreed with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;14	`` God does not look with favor on the taking of any human life , '' Vinson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;15	`` The killing of a person is not intrinsically wrong -- if that person deserves death , '' Hill said in an interview broadcast Thursday on CBS .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;16	`` My actions were to defend the innocent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;17	Therefore , I am certainly guilty of no crimes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0326;18	As a matter of fact , my actions are honorable . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;0	Swedish divers looked inside the sunken ferry Estonia for the first time on Friday , finding decks `` demolished '' after the ship 's 200-foot -LRB- 60-meter -RRB- plunge to the Baltic Sea floor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;1	Maritime authorities declined to say whether the divers found any bodies in the wreck , where an estimated 800 people were entombed when the ferry sank on Sept. 28 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;2	`` It 's extremely demolished , '' Swedish maritime administration spokesman Lars-Goran Bronow told the news agency TT .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;3	`` It happened when the ship turned upside down . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;4	The ferry sank in about 30 minutes after a storm ripped off its front cargo door .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;5	Investigators say it capsized and probably rolled over completely before hitting bottom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;6	It now lies on its side 180-280 feet -LRB- 56-84 -RRB- meters under water off Finland 's southwestern coast .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;7	Divers had examined two of the ship 's six decks as of Friday afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;8	Weather permitting , teams of six divers plan to work in shifts around the clock for four days surveying the ship 's interior , authorities said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;9	They will work their way into the bridge , where authorities hope to retreive navigational computers and other records that might provide clues about what happened , Bronow said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;10	`` The weather conditions are good .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;11	The weather wo n't hinder the work , '' Bronow told TT earlier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;12	Working in near-freezing water , the divers ' mission is to gather evidence to help authorities decide whether to raise the ship , retreive the bodies or take some other action .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;13	Of the estimated 1,049 people on the ferry , 137 survived , according to the latest figures published Friday by the Finnish police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;14	Only 94 bodies have been recovered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;15	The rest are believed in the ship , although officials have said they may never know the exact number because of unreliable passenger lists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;16	Authorities said they will not disclose any divers ' information about bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;17	Each diver was required to sign a contract barring him from describing the scene to anybody but investigators and officials , Swedish media reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;18	`` -LRB- This -RRB- mission does not include bringing anybody to the surface , '' Swedish Communications Minister Ines Uusmann told the newspaper Aftonbladet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;19	Swedish authorities hope to decide on a course of action by mid-December , and were focusing on several options .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;20	In one , salvagers could scour the wreck to retrieve all the bodies they find , or could do that plus flip it over using cables to find more bodies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;21	They also could leave all the bodies and fill the wreck with sand to `` bury '' the victims and protect the wreck from scavengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;22	The divers are working from a large , floating research platform called SEMI 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;23	The work was scheduled to begin Wednesday , but was delayed because the ships apparently had been given the wrong coordinates for the wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0327;24	The Swedish government , meanwhile , said Friday it has decided to give 3 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 417,000 -RRB- to organizations helping victims ' families , in many cases including orphans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;0	The Danish capital , already filled with bicyclists on city streets , hopes it found a way to get even more people on two wheels -- for free .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;1	Sponsors on Friday showed bikes that people will be allowed to ride at no cost , starting next spring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;2	Though a previous free-bike program failed before , Danish officials think they 've solved the problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;3	Under the new private initiative backed by government officials , bicyclists will have to deposit a 20-kroner coin -LRB- dlrs 3.30 -RRB- at a special rack to pick up one of the 1,000 city-provided bikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;4	The money will be returned when the bike is taken back to any one of 200 racks located throughout the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;5	`` In a city where everyone is bicycling there 's a need for free bikes , '' said Bente Frost , Copenhagen 's transportation mayor , after her maiden ride on a Bycykel , which means City Bike in Danish .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;6	Thirty percent of Copenhagen residents ride bikes to work during the summer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;7	Frost said up to 5,000 bicycles would be ready when Copenhagen becomes the European cultural capital in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;8	Each year about 27,000 bicycles are stolen in Copenhagen , costing insurance companies 41 million kroner -LRB- dlrs 6.7 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;9	The city hopes the program will help the environment and curb bicycle thefts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;10	Would-be thieves are discouraged from stealing the bike for refitting because none of the Bycykel 's parts fit to standard bicycles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;11	Morten Sadolin , a businessman who helped design the project , said they also planned poster campaigns to tell people that if a Bycykel is seen `` miles outside Copenhagen , it must be stolen . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;12	The easily recognizable Bycykel has advertisements from sponsors on the clumsy-looking frame .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;13	It has no speeds and will only be suitable for short distances .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;14	The Copenhagen city council -- interested in reducing air pollution and traffic congestion - is backing the private initiative .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;15	Sadolin said several cities , among them Aspen , Colorado , and Adelaide in Australia , had shown interest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0328;16	`` One city at the time , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;0	A decision on whether British Formula One driver David Coulthard stays with Williams or drives for McLaren next year is not expected for another two weeks , officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;1	Coulthard 's case went before the Formula One Contracts Recognition Board in Geneva on Friday but no final verdict was reached .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;2	`` The proceedings have begun and the decision is expected in 15 days ' time , '' said Martin Whitaker , a spokesman for the international automobile federation FIA .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;3	British news reports said Coulthard recently signed with McLaren , angering Williams officials who claim he is still under contract with them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;4	The board meeting is to decide which contract is valid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;5	If the Scottish driver goes to McLaren , he will likely team with Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;6	That would leave the door open for Nigel Mansell to sign with Williams as Damon Hill 's teammate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;7	Coulthard , 23 , emerged as a rising star for Williams after he was promoted from test driver following the death of Ayrton Senna at the San Marino Grand Prix last May .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;8	He was paired with Hill for the rest of the season until Mansell returned from the Indy car series to race in the final three races .
APW_ENG_19941202.0329;9	Coulthard 's best performance was a second-place finish behind Hill in the Portuguese Grand Prix .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;0	The once grand idea of U.N. peacekeeping as a global 911 appears to be fading as the United Nations closes shop in Somalia and faces humiliation in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;1	With the United Nations in apparent retreat , observers are saying that future peacekeeping is likely to shy away from where it is needed most : the front lines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;2	Bosnia is a `` bucket of cold water on ambitious plans for peacekeeping , '' said Richard Betts , professor of political science at Columbia University .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;3	`` I think there is a great future for peacekeeping that does not matter very much , and a very shaky future for messier operations . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;4	That seemed apparent this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;5	As Serb militiamen held hundreds of peacekeepers hostage and pounded a U.N.-declared safe haven in Bosnia , the Security Council met in New York , but high on its agenda was the Golan Heights , not Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;6	The quick meeting extending the mandate for the Israeli-Syrian border mission highlighted a U.N. success -- a mission where both sides want peace and the border is quiet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;7	The council talks later dragged on about Bosnia , but without direct action .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;8	`` Peacekeeping is the role of referee , '' said Dan Plesch , director of the British-American Security Information Council in London .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;9	`` You can separate warring parties who want to be separated . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;10	But in instances like Bosnia and Somalia , where the sides are n't willing to stop fighting , the United Nations is refusing to order its peacekeepers to separate the sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;11	Such a direct role would be war , not peacekeeping , council members say .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;12	Many observers say missions like those in Golan and Cyprus -- with clear and limited objectives such as monitoring borders or delivering aid to war zones -- are likely to expand in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;13	`` But we will also see peacekeeping used by the United States and other powers as a way of repackaging war , '' Plesch said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;14	He cited Haiti and Georgia as examples .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;15	The United States pushed the Council to authorize military intervention in Haiti , offering its own soldiers to lead the mission that will give way to a U.N. peacekeeping force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;16	Russia would like to do much the same in Georgia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;17	It has already sent its own troops to the former Soviet republic , but is pressing the United Nations to take over the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;18	While Bosnia -- with 24,000 soldiers or almost a third of all U.N. peacekeepers -- would prove the greatest U.N. peacekeeping failure if it collapses , the United Nations has lost face on other missions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;19	It was unable to foster peace in Somalia , and decided this fall to wind down its two-year mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;20	In Liberia , observers have been abused and humiliated by the warring factions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;21	U.N. officials bristle at criticisms that peacekeeping has been ineffective and say the problem is that world leaders are not willing to commit the troops or money to ambitious peacekeeping operations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;22	The world body is being made a scapegoat for the lack of global will to act , said Kofi Annan , the head of U.N. peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;23	`` It is absolutely unfair when member states do not want to take the risks , when they do not want to commit the resources , but blame the U.N. for failure to act , '' Annan said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;24	U.N. peacekeeping costs have ballooned to $ 3.8 billion for the year ending April 1994 , but by October , members still owed the world body $ 1.6 billion for peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;25	There are some 80,000 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;26	U.N. missions involved only about 10,000 soldiers in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;27	With a more isolationist Congress coming into power in Washington , it is unlikely the United States -- which pays about a third of the peacekeeping budget -- would be willing to pay for additional operations that are not directly in the U.S. interest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;28	`` There may be other Bosnias , but I do n't think there will be another UNPROFOR , '' said William Durch , a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;29	`` If the West is not willing to act on its own doorstep why would it do it elsewhere ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;30	UNPROFOR is the peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;31	Lewis MacKenzie , a veteran of nine peacekeeping operations and the former head of the Sarajevo operation , points out that despite its shortcomings , the U.N. mission in Bosnia still ensures that millions of people receive food every day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;32	And the retired major-general says that despite the problems , there is still a need for peacekeeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0330;33	`` People who talks about the loss of credibility will be on bended knees before the U.N. at the next crisis , '' MacKenzie said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;0	U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali met with the Turkish Cypriot leader Friday in continuing efforts to reunite Cyprus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;1	Rauf Denktash told reporters after the 50-minute meeting that he understood Boutros-Ghali would instruct his representative on the divided Mediterranean island to organize fresh talks between the opposing Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;2	`` We are ready to continue the talks ... with political equality and Swiss-like sovereignty , '' said Denktash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;3	Denktash met informally with President Glafcos Clerides , leader of the majority Christian Greeks , five times this fall as part of a confidence-building exercise to gain each other 's trust .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;4	They were the first meetings between the two leaders in a year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;5	Cyprus was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup by supporters of a union with Greece .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;6	Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway republic in the north in 1983 , but only Turkey recognizes it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0332;7	The main sticking points are the Turkish Cypriot demand for recognition of their breakaway state , and their rejection of the U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the withdrawal of some 35,00 Turkish troops and 50,000 mainland settlers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;0	Stefan Edberg had to rally from match point in the final set and Magnus Larsson likewise prevailed in five sets Friday , giving Sweden a sweep of opening singles and a 2-0 lead over Russia in the Davis Cup final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;1	Edberg faced match point trailing 5-4 in the fifth set , but rallied to beat Alexander Volkov 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;2	Larsson , ranked 19th by the ATP Tour , followed by overcoming a whistling , foot-stomping home crowd of 12,000 , to beat No. 11 ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-0 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 2-6 , 6-3 victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;3	The opening-day setbacks severely hurt Russia 's chances of becoming the first unseeded team to win the Davis Cup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;4	On Saturday , Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy must upset the top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned ATP Tour doubles champions Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell to keep their hopes alive and send the best-of-five match to Sunday 's reverse singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;5	Friday loss was Kafelnikov 's first in eight Davis Cup matches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;6	His only other loss was in debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;7	In Friday 's first match , Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;8	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;9	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;10	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;11	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;12	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared enroute to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;13	But buoyed by the flag-waving , cheering crowd , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;14	The 27-year-old Volkov then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;15	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;16	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;17	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;18	Having broken Volkov to tie the set , Edberg had the added distraction of Russian President Boris Yeltsin entering Olympic Stadium just as the Swede was preparing to start the next game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;19	Edberg , who had been whistled in derision by the crowd , paced along the baseline as Yeltsin and his entourage took their seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;20	`` I saw a lot of people coming in , but I did n't know it was Yeltsin , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;21	`` I just put it aside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;22	I felt so happy being back in the match . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;23	Considering the outcome , `` maybe I should thank Boris for coming in , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;24	Volkov did not blame Yeltsin for his loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;25	`` I could n't have failed to notice when the president arrived , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;26	`` -LRB- But -RRB- I can say it interfered with my game as much as rain outside would have , because I had lost my serve by then . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;27	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;28	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;29	`` I 've been in the same situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;30	He 's probably feeling quite depressed tonight , '' Edberg said about Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;31	`` On the other hand , he was out of the match and came back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;32	Sweden has beaten Russia in their two previous Davis Cup encounters , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;33	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title .
APW_ENG_19941202.0333;34	It is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;0	The city health department on Friday opened a room where heroin addicts can take their drugs in clean surroundings with fresh needles , the first such experiment in Germany .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;1	Backers of the project , which aims to convince 150 long-term addicts to try methadone or withdrawal treatment and stop the spread of AIDS , had to override objections from national officials who said it could encourage use of illegal drugs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;2	Similar `` junkie rooms '' have been set up in several European cities to entice addicts out of squalid conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;3	The Swiss cities Basel and Zurich have such places , and in the Netherlands , Rotterdam has a designated place by the central train station where junkies can do whatever they please .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;4	The Frankfurt hard-drugs scene , also centered on the main train station , has been cleaned up in recent years as police forced several hundred foreigners to leave and clamped down on an open drugs market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;5	But 150 long-term local addicts remain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;6	The city drugs commissioner , Margarethe Nimsch , opened the so-called Gesundheitraum -- Health Room -- in Frankfurt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;7	It is in an old factory building far from the train station , and a shuttle bus will carry addicts to the facility , which is next to a counseling office and a hostel for addicts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;8	`` It is a command of humanity to help addicts out of their misery and not to fence them out , '' Ms. Nimsch said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;9	Police and prosecutors have agreed to tolerate the project as long as those using it show they are over 18 and addicted but not in a withdrawal or methadone program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;10	They have to bring their own drugs -- sales on the premises are not permitted -- but fresh syringes are supplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;11	The remote location of the `` junkie room '' was an obvious drawback , and it remained to be seen whether addicts would be willing to make the trip .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;12	Police Inspector Roland Ullmann said the project would have to observed for a while to see if it is a success .
APW_ENG_19941202.0334;13	`` But one has to have the courage to close such a facility after a year or two if it does n't work , '' Ullmann said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;0	While the United Nations deliberates whether to continue operations in Bosnia , the Bosnian Serbs basically are deciding the issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;1	They 've virtually closed the mission down .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;2	Consider : -- Delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians is basic to the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;3	But Bosnian Serbs have refused to approve convoys through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;4	-- Sarajevo depends on the U.N. airlift for 80 percent of its supplies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;5	For more than a week , the up-again , down-again airlift has not flown because the Serbs refuse to approve flights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;6	To reinforce the message , the Serbs deployed surface-to-air missiles in the air corridor approaching Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;7	-- More than 400 peacekeepers , including French , British , Dutch , Canadians and Ukrainians , have been taken hostage against future NATO strikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;8	Apart from delivering humanitarian aid , the U.N. mission is supposed to enforce agreements , such as those on removal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area and on protection of U.N. `` safe areas . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;9	Those military functions have been severely curtailed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;10	The United Nations is unable even to get permission from the Bosnian Serbs to resupply its own units in isolated Muslim enclaves such as Bihac and Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;11	Most of the detained peacekeepers were guarding collection points in the Sarajevo area , where Bosnian Serbs stored heavy guns after last February 's NATO ultimatum to remove such weapons from within 12.5 miles of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;12	Both the Bosnian Serb and government forces routinely have put banned weapons in the zone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;13	Apart from bluff and bluster , the U.N. has found no tools to force compliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;14	Last week , Bosnian Serb soldiers simply drove up to the nine collection points and surrounded them , trapping the peacekeepers inside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;15	The presence of U.N. hostages virtually guarantees no NATO air strikes to follow three last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;16	U.N. relations with both sides have been touchy , and are getting worse .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;17	The Serbs are in a position to punish the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;18	Sources who attended a U.N. staff meeting Thursday quoted the commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , as saying that the Bosnian Serbs `` have declared war '' on the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;19	On Wednesday , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the Sarajevo airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;20	Boutros-Ghali had come to Sarajevo to warn the two sides that the United Nations might pull out of Bosnia-Herzegovina entirely if they did not cooperate with the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;21	U.N. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , say they fear the Bosnian Serbs have decided to step up harassment in hopes the U.N. packs up and leaves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;22	During the past 2 -LCB- years , the United Nations has faced similar periods of harassment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;23	But U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , Thant Myint-U , described the current level of hostility as unprecedented .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;24	`` While we will certainly continue operations throughout the country in fulfillment of our various mandates as best we can , this unprecedented level of non-cooperation by the Bosnian Serb party is certainly not making our jobs any easier , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;25	Thant said the level of harassment is so intense and widespread that the United Nations believes it must have been approved at the highest level , presumably by Karadzic and his military chief , Gen. Ratko Mladic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0335;26	Since all U.N. operations here can only be carried out with the approval of the warring sides , absence of cooperation means the mission grinds to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;0	U.S. Senate Democrats on Friday selected Sen. Thomas Daschle as their minority leader for the next Congress , opting for a young , amiable lawmaker with scant experience in the national limelight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;1	Republicans chose unopposed Kansas Sen. Bob Dole as majority leader for the second time in his career .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;2	But they moved to the right in dumping Sen. Alan Simpson as whip in favor of younger and more conservative Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi , an ally of Dole 's potential rival for their party 's 1996 presidential nomination .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;3	The Republicans wrested majority control of both Houses of Congress from the Democrats , President Clinton 's party , in the Nov. 8 national election .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;4	The leaders elected Friday will begin official business in January and could affect the tone and politics of the Senate for years to come .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;5	Daschle , a two-term South Dakota Democrat , defeated the more feisty , combative Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut to succeed Majority Leader George Mitchell , who is retiring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;6	The vote was 24-23 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;7	`` We will offer constructive alternatives , not gridlock , '' said Daschle .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;8	`` We stand to offer vigorous opposition to extreme proposals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;9	... We will fight against proposals that are mean spirited . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;10	Lott , who also won by a single vote , 27-26 , said he was `` honored that I will be able to serve with our majority leader -LRB- Dole -RRB- ... he 's been such a fantastic leader . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;11	He added that `` I also am committed '' to working with the Democratic leadership .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;12	Simpson said Lott `` is what the party has asked for at this time , a change in leadership and change perhaps in style . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;13	Simpson had been Dole 's No. 2 man since 1985 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;14	Now 63 , his relaxed manner is spiced with a sharp , folksy wit that has sometimes gotten him into clashes -- frequently with the press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;15	His credentials are mostly conservative , although he has favored abortion rights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;16	Lott , 53 , is an energetic former House of Representatives whip with close ties to the incoming Republican House Speaker , Newt Gingrich .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;17	He is also an ally of Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas who is likely to challenge Dole for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;18	Lott 's combative style is in tune with the Senate 's growing cadre of younger , more conservative Republicans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;19	Since March , Daschle , 46 , has been campaigning for the Democratic leadership job methodically and behind the scenes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;20	His work for agriculture and veterans programs has gained little public attention for the boyish-looking lawmaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;21	Dodd has been in the Senate six years longer than Daschle , and has a higher profile .
APW_ENG_19941202.0336;22	A former Peace Corps worker , he is best known for his vocal opposition to the Reagan administration 's policies in Central America and for his support of programs for children .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;0	Negotiations to end the National Hockey League lockout broke off abruptly on Friday when neither side showed any willingness to budge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;1	`` We did n't have anything more to provide to each other , '' union head Bob Goodenow said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;2	`` They presented their positions and stated them to us Friday and , likewise , we stated our positions on various issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;3	One could say we agreed to disagree on the issues as they were , give it more thought and more work , and see if some ideas could develop before we met again . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;4	There had been hope that an eight-hour meeting Thursday would pave the way for the end of the 63-day labor dispute .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;5	But after meeting for only about an hour Friday , collective bargaining talks were tabled until Monday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;6	`` We 'll be back here in Chicago , '' said commissioner Gary Bettman , the front man in negotiations for the owners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;7	`` There just was n't anything further that we could productively discuss Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;8	As a result , we agreed to meet on Monday . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;9	Management and union representatives had resumed negotiations in Chicago , mindful that a labor agreement probably would have to be in place within two weeks to salvage a 50-game North American ice hockey season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;10	`` I 'm hoping at some point we get into position to make a deal , '' Bettman said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;11	`` If you 're asking me ... what makes me think the rhetoric will change , it may not .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;12	`` Time is a factor and the longer this goes on , the more of a factor time becomes . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;13	Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden , a management hard-liner , said negotiations ended Friday because `` we tapped out on conversation . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0337;15	`` We sat on it overnight and there were no new ideas . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;16	Since the owners locked out the players Oct. 1 , the season has been pared to 60 games , with 24 games stripped from each team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;17	Among the issues discussed Thursday were a rookie salary cap , salary arbitration and free agency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;18	But the major obstacle , the luxury tax , remained in the background .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;19	The Canadian Press reported Thursday that the union dropped its desired salary ceiling for first-round draft picks to dlrs 1.25 million from dlrs 1.5 million for first-round players , while the NHL remained at dlrs 700,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;20	On salary arbitration , the NHL wants to retain its right to have an arbitrator 's decision to be non-binding on the team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0337;21	Rather than paying the awarded salary , a team could allow the player to become an unrestricted free agent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0338;0	Share prices fell Friday on the London Stock Exchange .
APW_ENG_19941202.0338;1	The benchmark Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down 22.3 points , or 0.73 percent , at 3,017.3 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0339;0	The International Committee of the Red Cross will continue its humanitarian mission in Bosnia even if UN peacekeepers pull out of the war-torn republic , the organization 's president said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;1	`` I would regret UNPROFOR leaving because the presence of so many blue helmets has certainly had a deterrent effect to the conduct of war , '' Cornelio Sommaruga said , referring to the United Nations military force in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;2	Faced with an escalation of the fighting and increased harassment of the peacekeepers by Bosnian Serbs , UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned this week that the world body 's 23,000 soldiers may be withdrawn unless the warring sides agree to cooperate with the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;3	There has been no indication , however , that a U.N. pullout , which would require a Security Council decision , is imminent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;4	Countries contributing the bulk of the UN troops , including Britain and France , also have said they would pull their men out if the fighting persists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;5	`` The ICRC has a mission to protect and assist victims wherever there is a conflict , and this mission is completely independent from the UN , '' Sommaruga said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;6	`` We would certainly continue to be there . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;7	In the past , there have been serious doubts whether scores of international humanitarian organizations , which have provided massive relief aid to needy Bosnians in the past 21\/2 years , could continue to operate if the peacekeepers withdrew .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;8	But the decision by a major relief supplier such as the ICRC to remain in Bosnia may sway other groups to continue providing assistance in such an event .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;9	Sommaruga said the Geneva-based body already had prepared contingency plans for a possible UN withdrawal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;10	`` There is no humanitarian operation without problems .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;11	When you are operating in the middle of the war , you will always have problems reaching the victims , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;12	`` But in Bosnia we have had more problems than we have normally . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;13	In addition to providing food and medical aid , the 130-year-old organization is engaged in tracing , visiting and freeing prisoners of war held by the various warring factions , and in reuniting families dispersed by the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;14	But Sommaruga indicated that if the fighting worsened considerably , even the ICRC may be forced to reconsider its stand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0339;15	`` What would affect our operations would be the way in which the conflict is conducted , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0340;0	The ex-wife of fugitive British businessman Asil Nadir was released Friday after being detained on charges of trying illegally to sell an antique marble fountain , a private television station reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0340;1	Atv said a judge ordered the release of Aysegul Tecimer pending trial .
APW_ENG_19941202.0340;2	She was detained on Tuesday when she offeredt o sell the historic piece to undercover police for 2 billion Turkish lire -LRB- dlrs 55,500 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0340;3	Tecimer , well known in Turkey for her extensive antique and jewelry collection , was also detained earlier this year linked to the alleged sale of a stolen antique Koran .
APW_ENG_19941202.0340;4	Nadir , the chairman of the food conglomerate Polly Peck International , escaped to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus last year after he jumped bail in Britain on charges of stealing dlrs 47 million from the company .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;0	Still angry about NATO 's plans to admit former Warsaw Pact foes , Russia on Friday brushed aside attempts to get it to follow through on plans for close military links with the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;1	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev refused to soften his opposition to a NATO blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of East European countries in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;2	He told a closed-door meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not move closer to the alliance until it provided more details about its intentions , sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether there had been any change in NATO since it was a military machine arrayed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War era .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;4	On Thursday , he stunned U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by blasting the plan and backing out of a program for close military and political ties .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;5	He complained NATO 's proposals would create a new division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;6	A day later , Christopher sought to play down the embarrassing incident , which ruined the alliance 's efforts to present a united front on the sensitive issue of expanding NATO territory farther east .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;7	`` We should n't make too much of yesterday 's events , '' Christopher told CBS ' `` This Morning '' program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;8	He and others expressed confidence Moscow would eventually agree to a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts , which were designed to ease Russia 's fears of being isolated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;9	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;10	Ties between NATO and Russia , he said , are `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;11	Despite Russia 's objections , NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes insisted , `` We are not ready to change any words in our decision '' ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the conditions for expansion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;12	If Russia was miffed about the membership plans , other East European nations were delighted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;13	`` We think this is an important milestone on the road to an undivided Europe , '' said Poland 's foreign minister , Andrzej Olechowski .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;14	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would be attached .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;15	The allies , though , have been hesitant about moving too quickly to admit their one-time foes for fear of upsetting and isolating Russia , still a formidable military power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;16	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , which was seen as a waiting room for East Europeans eager to join .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;17	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;18	On Thursday , the allies decided to push ahead and ordered a blueprint of terms , costs and conditions for expanding the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;19	But , mindful of Russia 's worries , they promised not to identify any front-runners for membership nor set any entry dates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0341;20	`` The Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did yesterday , and I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official on Friday denied reports the alliance had agreed to a U.N. request to stop enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;2	NATO Secretary General Willy Claes said he knew of no request from the U.N. to halt or scale-down enforcement of the military flight ban which is designed to protect the civilians from bombardment in the 31-month war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;3	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;4	Claes told reporters after a meeting here of foreign ministers from NATO and former East bloc nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;5	Christopher told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;6	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them `` and we continue to police the no-fly zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;7	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York also denied reports that the United Nations had formally requested a suspension of the no-fly zone
APW_ENG_19941202.0342;8	`` There is no intention of requesting such a suspension , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;0	The Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement Friday that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;1	A six-month war in 1991 -- at the start of the violent breakup of Yugoslavia -- left Serbs in control of one-third of Croatian territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;2	There have been thousands of skirmishes and larger confrontations between the two since a January 1992 ceasefire halted the war
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;3	The economic agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;4	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are ontrolled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;5	The signing of the agreement coincided with the fiercest battlefield clashes since the U.N. brokered another cease-fire last March , Alun Roberts , a U.N. spokesman in Knin , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;6	Artillery duels continued for the third day Friday in the area of Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , the capital of Serb-held territory in Croatia , Alexander Ivanko , another U.N. spokesman , said in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;7	He said six Serb soldiers were reported wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;8	Meanwhile , the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency quoted Bosnian Serb sources as saying that `` regular Croatian troops supported by HVO -LRB- Bosnian Croat militia -RRB- continued their offensive Friday against Bosnian Serb territories '' in the region between Grahovo and Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;9	It claimed that seven Serb civilians and soldiers had been killed while 3,000 people fled their homes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;10	There was no U.N. confirmation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;11	Representatives of the Croatian government signed the economic accord Friday morning at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , with international mediators Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg as co-signers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;12	The document was then brought to Knin , rebel Serb headquarters , where their leaders signed it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;13	`` The significance of the agreement is going to depend on the parties to the agreement , '' Owen told The Associated Press in Knin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;14	The two sides `` have it in their power to implement the agreement if they want to , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;15	`` For many people it has been senseless to be deprived of water , electricity , '' Owen said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;16	`` The basics of economic life can now be made available to all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;17	But he warned : `` This agreement can easily be blown up literally and metaphorically .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;18	The fighting is continued challenge to it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;19	Croatian Serb representative Borislav Mikelic , though signing the agreement , remained firm in the Serbs ' refusal to accept any reintegration with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;20	`` By signing this agreement we once more proved that we are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis here and we also showed that we 're interested in the economic progress and economic opening to Europe and the world , '' Mikelic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;21	But he refused to discuss the crucial overall political solution , saying , `` This is not the time to talk about it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;22	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;23	Negotiations between the two sides had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;24	But the Croatian Serbs relented after a recent clandestine meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , the Balkans power broker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;25	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since the 1992 cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;26	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941202.0343;27	This is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0344;0	The International Committee of the Red Cross will continue its humanitarian mission in Bosnia even if UN peacekeepers pull out of the war-torn republic , the organization 's president said Friday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0345;8	`` There is no intention of requesting such a suspension , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Friday with key European foreign ministers , setting the stage for new overtures to the Bosnian Serbs in an effort to end the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;1	The meeting with ministers of France , Britain , Russia and Germany came as the Bosnian Serbs tightened their grip on the mostly Muslim Bihac enclave and as the conflict threatened to spread into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;2	Two of the ministers , Alain Juppe of France and Douglas Hurd of Britain , plan to carry a peace plan to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade Sunday in the hope he would recommend it to his allies in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;3	Before the ministers meeting , Christopher told reporters : `` I think it 's important we come out of it unified but also that we come out of it with effective steps . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;4	Juppe , as he left for the meeting of the five-nation `` contact group , '' acknowledged : `` It wo n't be easy ; that wo n't surprise you . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;5	Christopher wants Milosevic to threaten to seal Serbia 's border to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;6	Despite a promise to halt weapons deliveries , Clinton administration officials said , arms were still getting through to fuel the Bosnian Serbs ' drive to gain more territory and to terrorize Muslim civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;7	The war has taken an estimated 200,000 lives and left many times that number homeless .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;8	Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs , contributing to the decision by the U.N. commander , Sir Michael Rose , not to conduct heavy bombing raids against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;9	Christopher 's plan , which was adopted by President Clinton 's senior foreign policy advisers Monday at a White House meeting , calls for a cease-fire in the Bihac area , a cessation of hostilities for three to six months throughout Bosnia and a peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;10	There , the Bosnian Serbs would be able to promote their aspirations for a Greater Serbia , initially with political links to Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;11	They hope also to establish cross-border ties to ethnic Serbs in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;12	Elements of the plan are similar to one rejected repeatedly by the Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;13	It called for them to accept Bosnia as a legitimate country and to shrink the territory under their control to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;14	A federation of Muslims and Croats would be in charge of 51 percent of the war-torn country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;15	Even that division is negotiable once peace talks are resumed , U.S. officials said , hoping to induce the Serbs to halt their attacks and to negotiate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;16	Ironically , it was here at a NATO summit meeting in January that Clinton and allied leaders decided that NATO warplanes should be used to protect Bosnian Muslim civilians from attacks by rebel Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;17	Clinton had campaigned against former President Bush 's policy as not being tough enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;18	He also proposed excluding the Bosnian government from a U.N. arms embargo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;19	But France and Britain prevailed in their resistance to a military approach .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;20	The Clinton administration has capitulated with some grumbling over its shoulder that the United Nations should have authorized sustained bombing and that the Bush administration should have done more than provide humanitarian assistance to trapped civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;21	In weighing diplomatic approaches , the five-nation group also considered a plan to urge Serbia to recognize the borders of Croatia and Bosnia make peace with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;22	The incentive would be an easing of economic sanctions against Milosevic 's government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;23	While the ministers are trying to enlist Milosevic , Christopher said , it would not be proper to have a further easing of sanctions against Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;24	When Milosevic promised to cut off arms supplies to Bosnian Serbs , some of the sanctions were lifted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;25	This included opening of the Belgrade airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;26	Again signaling a willingness to compromise with the Serbs , Christopher did not rule out political union between the Serbs in Bosnia with Serbia itself `` if it would mean reaching a peaceful resolution '' of the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0347;27	He said that was a constitutional issue the parties -- Serbs , Muslims and Croats -- should decide among themselves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0348;0	Secretary of State Warren Christopher dismissed as incorrect Friday reports that NATO had decided to stop enforcing a U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0348;1	The ban on military flights is designed to protect the civilians from bombardment in the 31-month war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0348;2	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0348;3	He told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0348;4	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them `` and we continue to police the no-fly zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;0	President Nelson Mandela 's government started fulfilling campaign promises Friday , allocating more than 1 billion rand -LRB- dlrs 285 million -RRB- for health care and development projects .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;1	Most of the money for the Reconstruction and Development Program went for health projects , including 500 million rand -LRB- dlrs 142.5 million -RRB- to provide free health care for children and pregnant women .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;2	Another 472 million rand -LRB- dlrs 133 million -RRB- went for feeding schemes at schools in rural areas and black townships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;3	The government designated 2 billion rand -LRB- dlrs 570 million -RRB- for the development program in the 1994-1995 budget year , and Friday 's announcement was the first direct allocation of some of that money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;4	Mandela and his African National Congress promised the multibillion rand reconstruction program during campaigning for the nation 's first all-race election in April .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;5	The ANC won the vote and heads the first black-led government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;6	The Reconstruction and Development Program is an ambitious five-year plan that calls for building 1 million houses , providing power and running water to millions of poor blacks and creating jobs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;7	Critics question if the government can afford the plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0351;8	Along with the free health care and school feeding projects , money was allocated for building health clinics , running the government 's land reform program and providing grants to help people buy land .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;0	Lebanon 's prime minister , once hailed as the savior of a country ravaged by 15 years of civil war , promised to resign Friday , but hinted he might return to office if quarrelsome ministers are ousted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;1	Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told the president during a stormy Cabinet meeting Thursday night that he was quitting after more than two years in office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;2	He planned to sumbit a letter of resignation next week , aides said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;3	Hariri , a 51-year-old billionaire , has long been frustrated by opposition to his economic and reconstruction policies by several Cabinet ministers allied with neighboring Syria , the undisputed power in Lebanon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;4	His resignation would be a severe setback to efforts to rebuild Lebanon from the destruction of the 1975-90 civil war , which killed 150,000 people , maimed tens of thousands and caused an estimated dlrs 25 billion in damage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;5	But in his first public appearance since the Cabinet meeting , Hariri hinted he could accept reappointment as prime minister if ministers blocking his programs were excluded from the new government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;6	`` We will not retreat from our latest move , '' Hariri said at the inauguration of a book fair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;7	`` We will not backtrack from rebuilding the country ... whether we are still in power or not , '' he said in a 15-minute speech punctuated by applause .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;8	`` God willing , Lebanon will move forward and a bunch of gamblers , arrogant people and adventurers will not be able to halt the course of development and reconstruction , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;9	`` It 's imperative that a government of institutions evolve in Lebanon rather than a government of outlaws who join the system . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;10	It was by far the sharpest attack by the soft-spoken Hariri against opponents , some of whom are former militia warlords appointed to government posts as part of Muslim-Christian reconciliation pact .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;11	Syrian and Lebanese officials tried to talk Hariri out of resigning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;12	But his aides said he plans to submit a letter of resignation to President Elias Hrawi next week after a trip to Damascus Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;13	Hariri canceled a weekend trip to China and another to Morocco next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;14	The crisis erupted after the government on Thursday night decreed a 20 percent pay raise for workers , which was promptly rejected by the General Federation of Labor Unions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;15	The federation , which represents 350,000 workers , insists on an 80 percent hike to keep pace with rampant inflation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;16	The unions staged a one-day warning strike Tuesday to press their demands and threatened to escalate their protests Dec. 5 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;17	The government has also been beset by corruption allegations , which prompted a heated exchange during Thursday night 's Cabinet session .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;18	Housing Minister Mahmoud Abu Hamdan claimed Hariri , who has a fortune estimated at dlrs 3 billion , would benefit from a real estate deal in Beirut .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;19	Hariri stormed out of the Cabinet room .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;20	He later telephoned Hrawi and told him that he was determined to step down .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;21	Hariri was appointed prime minister Oct. 22 , 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;22	Many welcomed his ascent to power as a harbinger of Lebanon 's return to regional prominence as a financial and trading hub .
APW_ENG_19941202.0352;23	But corruption charges have dogged his two-year tenure and his high-handed style has angered opponents .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;0	Western allies and Russia on Friday discussed new ideas for peace in Bosnia , including a suggestion of a confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations gathered after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;2	Thus , Christopher sought to heal a rift with NATO allies France and Britain over the alliance 's use of force in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;3	On a visit to the NATO headquarters Thursday , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said he endorsed a confederation of Bosnian Serbs with neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;4	`` We do support the suggestion -LRB- of -RRB- an unambiguous recognition '' of Bosnian Serbs ' right to forge political links with the government in Belgrade , Kozyrev told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;5	Russia , France , Germany , Britain , France , and the U.S. comprise the contact group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;6	Kozyrev met here with Christopher in the margin of a NATO meeting before going over to the EU headquarters for the Contact Group talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;7	A U.S. official said Christopher 's `` understanding of Foreign Minister Kozyrev 's position is very clear , '' but that a Bosnian Serbs-Serbia political alliance was `` not a proposal we support at this time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;8	Also attending the meeting were Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe , the British and French foreign ministers who will go to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;9	The Contact Group , officials said , hoped to launch a new diplomatic initiative to try to draw the Bosnian Serbs into negotiations with the Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;10	It was expected to call for a cease-fire around Bihac , the northwestern Muslim enclave that Serbs are pummeling , a pledge to cease hostilities across Bosnia for up to six months , followed by an international peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;11	On offer for the Bosnian Serbs , who control about 70 percent of Bosnia , would be an opportunity to press their demand for cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;12	Hurd said this week that would not amount to giving in to Serb aspirations of a Greater Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;13	The current peace plan , that Bosnian Serbs have rejected , envisions a confederation between Croatia and the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;14	The core of the peace plan Bosnian Serbs have rejected is a division of Bosnia that would required them to return much territory they have seized in battle .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;15	The Contact Group meeting caps an eventful week in which U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali failed in his bid to meet with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Kardazic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;16	More than 400 of the 24,000 U.N. soldiers in Bosnia are being detained by the Serbs as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0353;17	NATO struck three times last week , but the attacks did nothing to stop the Serb assault on Bihac .

APW_ENG_19941202.0355;0	Stefan Edberg had to rally from match point in the final set and Magnus Larsson likewise prevailed in five sets Friday , giving Sweden a sweep of opening singles and a 2-0 lead over Russia in the Davis Cup final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;1	Edberg faced match point trailing 5-4 in the fifth set , but rallied to beat Alexander Volkov 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;2	Larsson , ranked 19th by the ATP Tour , followed by overcoming a whistling , foot-stomping home crowd of 12,000 , to beat No. 11 ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-0 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 2-6 , 6-3 victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;3	The opening-day setbacks severely hurt Russia 's chances of becoming the first unseeded team to win the Davis Cup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;4	On Saturday , Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy must upset the top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned ATP Tour doubles champions Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell to keep their hopes alive and send the best-of-five match to Sunday 's reverse singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;5	Friday loss was Kafelnikov 's first in eight Davis Cup matches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;6	His only other loss was in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;7	Kafelnikov said he felt `` mental and psychological pressure '' after Volkov 's dramatic defeat , and said he said he injured his left wrist in the second game of the crucial last set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;8	He strained the same wrist last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;9	`` It did n't really hurt but I felt very insecure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;10	I could n't hit slices , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;11	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;12	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;13	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;14	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;15	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;16	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared enroute to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;17	But buoyed by the flag-waving , cheering crowd , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;18	The 27-year-old Volkov then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;19	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;20	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;21	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;22	Having broken Volkov to tie the set , Edberg had the added distraction of Russian President Boris Yeltsin entering Olympic Stadium just as the Swede was preparing to start the next game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;23	Edberg , who had been whistled in derision by the crowd , paced along the baseline as Yeltsin and his entourage took their seats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;24	`` I saw a lot of people coming in , but I did n't know it was Yeltsin , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;25	`` I just put it aside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;26	I felt so happy being back in the match . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;27	Considering the outcome , `` maybe I should thank Boris for coming in , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;28	Volkov did not blame Yeltsin for his loss .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;29	`` I could n't have failed to notice when the president arrived , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;30	`` -LRB- But -RRB- I can say it interfered with my game as much as rain outside would have , because I had lost my serve by then . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;31	The left-handed Volkov was repeatedly rattled in the first two sets , hurling his racket to the ground twice after failing to reach Edberg returns at the baseline .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;32	Edberg was troubled by inconsistent serves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;33	`` I 've been in the same situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;34	He 's probably feeling quite depressed tonight , '' Edberg said about Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;35	`` On the other hand , he was out of the match and came back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;36	Sweden has beaten Russia in their two previous Davis Cup encounters , but the two have not faced each other since 1982 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;37	Russia hopes to become the first unseeded team to win the title .
APW_ENG_19941202.0355;38	It is only the seventh to reach the final .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;0	Many countries continue to resist according foreign banks the same operating rights as domestic ones , the U.S. Treasury Department reported to Congress Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;1	`` Intensive multilateral and bilateral negotiations have led to significant improvements in the terms on which U.S. firms compete in offering financial services abroad , '' the Treasury Department said in its 1994 study on national treatment for banks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;2	The study cited the North American Free Trade Agreement , which opened the Mexican market to U.S. financial institutions for the first time in over 50 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;3	And it noted progress in a number of key areas in negotiations with Japan , China , Korea and Taiwan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;4	It also noted that the new global trade agreement has established a multilateral framework that could be applied to trade in financial services .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;5	But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement accompanying the report `` while many countries have begun to recognize the economic benefits that come from liberalization of the financial sector , national treatment is still the exception rather than the rule in too many important markets . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;6	The Treasury is required to provide Congress with updates on national treatment issues every four years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;7	National treatment is the equal application of rules and regulations among domestic and foreign companies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;8	Bentsen said President Clinton 's administration continues to seek open markets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;9	`` But unless other commercially important countries are prepared to commit to open their markets to U.S. financial institutions , the United States will not be prepared to accept -LRB- a most-favored nation -RRB- obligation in financial services in the WTO , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;10	The Senate gave final congressional approval Thursday night to legislation implementing U.S. participation in a vastly expanded world free trade agreement to be enforced by the WTO , or World Trade Organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;11	Bentsen said that , in addition to the multilateral global trade talks , bilateral negotiations continue in several key markets , including `` a satisfactory outcome in the Japan Framework Talks on financial services . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;12	U.S. policy provides that the results achieved in the U.S.-Japan negotiations be extended to all countries on a most-favored nation basis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;13	The report notes a `` large and diverse presence '' of foreign financial institutions in the United States , including 288 foreign banks from 60 countries that operate 580 agencies and branches , and 91 banking subsidiaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;14	`` We want to continue to keep our markets open to foreign financial institutions , '' Bentsen said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;15	`` They play an important role in financing investment in the United States and they help keep our financial markets the most competitive and innovative in the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0356;16	`` But we also need to ensure that foreign countries provide the same degree of access to our firms in their markets , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;0	Iberia airline pilots Friday said they were prepared to take pay cuts to rescue the near-bankrupt company but insisted the reductions must be part of a genuine viability plan that would guarantee Iberia 's future .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;1	Following an all-day meeting , the pilots ' union SEPLA said a meeting was scheduled Monday with Iberia management .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;2	The union said it was prepared to consider demands for salary reductions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;3	But the pilots ' insistence that any wage cut must be part of an `` authentic viability plan '' appeared to suggest that they still did not fully accept Iberia 's latest restructuring plan as it stands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;4	`` You ca n't center everything on a salary reduction in exchange for a ` now we 'll see what we can do ' attitude , '' said SEPLA chief Armando Guajardo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;5	`` We 're not prepared to hand over the money with our eyes closed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;6	Hopes of implementing the viability plan appeared dashed Thursday when talks between management and SEPLA broke down over the issue of a sliding scale wage reduction of 15 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;7	The plan , accepted in principle by the company 's other main unions , also entails a wage freeze and a reduction of some 3,500 jobs through early retirements and pay-offs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;8	A restructuring plan agreed on by all unions is crucial if the European Commission is to consider allowing the Spanish government to grant Iberia a 130 billion peseta -LRB- dlrs 1 billion -RRB- capital injection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;9	Iberia has posted losses since 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;10	It ended last year 67 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 530 million -RRB- in the red while losses for this year are expected to top 40 billion pesetas -LRB- dlrs 300 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;11	Chairman Javier Salas has warned that the company would be technically bankrupt by March 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;12	If finally accepted by SEPLA , the plan would be put to a vote among the company 's 24,000 employees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;13	The viability proposals were thrashed out between management and the principal unions except SEPLA after the company threatened to enforce emergency measures , including the axing of 5,200 jobs and the sale of company assets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;14	That threat sparked a one-day walk-out on Monday that paralyzed the country 's airports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0357;15	Pilots represent some 5 percent of the 24,000-strong staff .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;0	As the scorched Achillo Lauro sank Friday into the Indian Ocean , a surviving passenger said one of the victims who died was injured when the crew dropped inflatable rafts on top of a crowded lifeboat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;1	The 979 passengers and crew who survived the fire on the Italian luxury liner were headed for three African and Middle Eastern ports aboard 10 rescue vessels , including freighters and U.S. warships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;2	They abandoned the blazing ship two days ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;3	The Achille Lauro was once a gleaming blue-and-white luxury liner that sailed around the world in 80 days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;4	But it was best known for the 1985 hijacking by Palestinian terrorists , who killed an elderly Jewish American passenger , Leon Klinghoffer , and dumped his body overboard in his wheelchair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;5	The terrorists escaped aboard a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced the plane down in Italy and the hijackers were arrested and later tried .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;6	Wednesday 's fire began in the engine room before dawn .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;7	Two elderly passengers died , one apparently of a heart attack .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;8	Eight people were injured as lifeboats and rafts were launched and the ship was abandoned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;9	According to passenger Geoffrey Wall , interviewed Friday by Britain 's Sky TV , one man was injured when crew members released inflatable rafts onto the lifeboat , which held about 35 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;10	`` It was tilting at an angle , '' said Wall , a Briton , describing attempts to lower a lifeboat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;11	`` They got it near the water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;12	They could n't lower it properly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;13	Then somebody hit the wrong -- I do n't know what it is that they release them with -- but they dropped two of these inflatable life boats on top of us , resulting in injury to one man . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;14	He said people gave the ailing man mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before a rescue ship arrived about four hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;15	`` We were in 100 yards -LRB- meters -RRB- or so of the rescue ship when he started to go ... unfortunately he died , '' Wall said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;16	It was not immediately clear if the man died of his injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;17	The ship 's owner , Naples , Italy-based Starlauro , had no immediate comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;18	Passenger Dennis Bassett , also told Sky TV that crew members did not alert all the passengers until only minutes before the order sounded to abandon ship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;19	`` Some passengers at 7 o'clock in the morning were still in bed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;20	The ship 's captain , Giuseppe Orsi , was the last to abandon the ship , which sank Friday evening off the coast of Somalia shortly after Italian tugboats reached the ailing vessel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;21	`` She was hooked up to the -LRB- tug -RRB- Solano and in 10 minutes , she collapsed -- pfft , she disappeared , '' said Antonio de Rosa , marketing director for Starlauro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;22	He put the loss at dlrs 25 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;23	Starlauro had hired seagoing tugs to bring the vessel home to try to save her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;24	Italian coast guard Lt. Francesco D'Amico said the ship was unrecoverable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;25	Orsi , aboard the oil tanker Hawaiian King , told the Italian news agency ANSA by radio phone he was `` very sorry '' about the news .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;26	`` I knew that by now she was unseaworthy , but what happened has greatly displeased me , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;27	`` The fire had destroyed her almost completely . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;28	Eight cargo vessels and two American warships , the USS Gettysburg and Halyburton , were carrying the surviving passengers and crew members to Djibouti , Mombasa in Kenya and Muskat in Oman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;29	Most were heading for Mombasa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;30	The first ship was expected to dock in Djibouti on Saturday ; the rest were scheduled to make port on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;31	The first fire aboard the Achille Lauro came in 1981 off the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0358;32	Passengers leaped from the decks into the Atlantic and two died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;0	Bosnian Serb gunners ringing Sarajevo fired five anti-tank missiles at the capital Friday , including two which hit government headquarters minutes before the chief U.N. envoy arrived for talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;1	It was yet another sign of the contempt with which Serbs hold the United Nations mission to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;2	More than 300 U.N. peacekeepers remained hostages of the Serbs , as insurance against further NATO airstrikes , but 70 were released Friday after being detained for seven days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;3	Two Sagger wire-guided missiles hit the Bosnian presidency building , which houses the offices of the top government officials , minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;4	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic moments after he left for the Akashi meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;5	Lazovic is an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;6	Later , three missiles hit nearby buildings as Akashi met in the presidency with top government and military officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;7	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;8	`` Until we achieve something tangible , this shuttle diplomacy must continue , '' Akashi told reporters in Sarajevo before leaving for Pale , the Bosnian Serb headquarters east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;9	But the Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for failing to use the necessary force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , even as fighting continued in that northwest region Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;10	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;11	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , referring to European capitulation to Adolf Hitler before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;12	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic that presumably focused on a proposed new peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;13	Redman , now ambassador to Germany , helped draft the first Contact Group peace plan , which the Serbs have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;14	Although that proposal was presented to the Serbs as a take-it-or-leave-it plan , the lack of Western will to use force has allowed the Serbs to demand , apparently successfully , the right of future confederal links with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;15	The original plan denied Serbs that as punishment for starting the war , though it granted the Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation similar rights to link with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;16	Akashi , on a mission to end the peacekeepers ' detention and win freedom of movement for U.N. convoys , hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;17	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed in even trying to meet the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides might force the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;18	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , Friday after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;19	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , along with hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;20	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic fighting around the government enclave of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;21	The United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;22	A number of detonations were reported on the outskirts of Bihac Friday , along with machine-gun and small arms fire , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;23	But the heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;24	The Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave , part of which is a U.N. `` safe area , '' in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;25	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;26	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;27	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;28	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia also had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0359;29	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;0	The Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement Friday that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;1	A six-month war in 1991 -- at the start of the violent breakup of Yugoslavia -- left Serbs in control of one-third of Croatian territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;2	There have been thousands of skirmishes and larger confrontations between the two since a January 1992 ceasefire halted the war
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;3	The economic agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;4	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220 mile -RRB- highway are ontrolled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;5	The signing of the agreement came amid the fiercest battlefield clashes since the U.N. brokered another cease-fire last March , Michael Williams , a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;6	Artillery duels continued for the third day Friday in the area of Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , the capital of Serb-held territory in Croatia , Alexander Ivanko , another U.N. spokesman in Zagreb , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;7	He said six Serb soldiers were reported wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;8	Meanwhile , the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency quoted Bosnian Serb sources as saying that `` regular Croatian troops supported by HVO -LRB- Bosnian Croat militia -RRB- continued their offensive Friday against Bosnian Serb territories '' in the region between Grahovo and Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;9	It claimed that seven Serb civilians and soldiers had been killed while 3,000 people fled their homes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;10	There was no U.N. confirmation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;11	Representatives of the Croatian government signed the economic accord Friday morning at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , with international mediators Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg as co-signers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;12	The document was then brought to Knin , rebel Serb headquarters , where their leaders signed it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;13	`` The significance of the agreement is going to depend on the parties to the agreement , '' Owen told The Associated Press in Knin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;14	The two sides `` have it in their power to implement the agreement if they want to , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;15	`` For many people it has been senseless to be deprived of water , electricity , '' Owen said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;16	`` The basics of economic life can now be made available to all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;17	But he warned : `` This agreement can easily be blown up literally and metaphorically .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;18	The fighting is continued challenge to it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;19	Croatian Serb representative Borislav Mikelic , though signing the agreement , remained firm in the Serbs ' refusal to accept any reintegration with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;20	`` By signing this agreement we once more proved that we are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis here and we also showed that we 're interested in the economic progress and economic opening to Europe and the world , '' Mikelic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;21	But he refused to discuss the crucial overall political solution , saying , `` This is not the time to talk about it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;22	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;23	Negotiations between the two sides had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;24	But the Croatian Serbs relented after a recent clandestine meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , the Balkans power broker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;25	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since the 1992 cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;26	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941202.0360;27	This is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;0	Russian lawmakers negotiating the release of prisoners in Chechnya accused their own government Friday of sending the jets that have attacked the breakaway republic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;1	The four-person delegation of Russian parliament members is trying to get Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev to release about 70 Russians , including Army soldiers and officers , who were captured in fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;2	Dudayev , who declared independence for his Caucasus Mountain republic in 1991 , says Moscow is arming and leading the rebels against him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;3	President Boris Yeltsin 's government has denied providing anything but political support , even as the rebel offensive has escalated from small-arms fire to jet attacks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;4	Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has called the captives mercenaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;5	Jets roared over the Chechen capital , Grozny , for a fourth day Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;6	Raids this week have killed at least four civilians and an airport guard , and destroyed planes at civilian and military airports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;7	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , a parliament member and Yeltsin 's former social welfare minister , who is part of the delegation in Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;8	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;9	`` You can rest assured that President Yeltsin has recognized the prisoners as members of the Russian Army , '' delegation leader Sergei Yushenkov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;10	A dozen of the prisoners , interviewed by The Associated Press while Chechen guards watched , said they were hired by Russia 's Federal Counterintelligence Service for secret operations with the Chechen rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;11	The men said they were promised money when the operation was over .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;12	But they said it went off badly , and that some of their Chechen allies did not know how to use guns and fled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;13	`` There are n't the words , '' imprisoned Capt. Alexander Tryukov said when asked how he felt about Grachev .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;14	Counterintelligence spokesman Alexander Mikhailov , asked about such reports at a news conference Friday , said only that Chechnya is part of Russia and that the servicemen should therefore be called volunteers , not mercenaries , ITAR-Tass and Interfax said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;15	Dudayev first threatened to kill the prisoners if Russia did not claim them , but later said they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;16	Yeltsin threatened to send troops if they were not released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;17	Moscow has since toned down the threat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;18	But it continued to beef up troops on Chechnya 's borders , news reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;19	Lawmaker Anatoly Shabad , a delegation member , said he believes the Russians will be released , but he criticized the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;20	`` We are against the way in which the opposition has used people with guns -- first locals and then Russian soldiers , '' Shabad said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;21	Since the air offensive began last week , thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;22	Chechen officials said a raid Friday targeted a tank regiment east of Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;23	Four people were killed in a missile attack Thursday at Katayama , about 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- from Grozny .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;24	A bus was hit and Dudayev said his home was bombed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;25	The opposition accuses Dudayev of running Chechnya 's economy into the ground .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;26	The main industry , oil refining , is operating at about 10 percent of capacity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;27	But Chechen pride and age-old enmity with Russia have rallied many people to Dudayev 's side , including some volunteers from other Caucasus regions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;28	Russia conquered the mainly Muslim Chechens in its imperial drive towards the Black Sea last century .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;29	Ethnic tensions suppressed in Soviet times have boiled over since the 1991 Soviet collapse .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;30	Many Russian nationalists vow never to let Chechnya go .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;31	But at a pro-Dudayev camp outside Grozny , 24-year-old Sergei Chicherov , a blue-eyed Cossack , had cast his lot with the Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0361;32	`` If someone comes and attacks your home , are you supposed to just sit and watch ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;0	Still angry about NATO 's plans to admit former Warsaw Pact members , Russia on Friday brushed aside attempts to get it to follow through on plans for close military links with the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;1	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev refused to soften his opposition to a NATO blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of East European countries in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;2	He told a closed-door meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not move closer to the alliance until it provided more details about its intentions , sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether there had been any change in NATO since it was a military machine arrayed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War era .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;4	On Thursday , he stunned U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by blasting the plan and backing out of a program for close military and political ties .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;5	He complained NATO 's proposals would create a new division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;6	A day later , Christopher sought to play down the embarrassing incident , which ruined the alliance 's efforts to present a united front on the sensitive issue of expanding NATO territory farther east .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;7	He and others expressed confidence Moscow would eventually agree to a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts , which were designed to ease Russia 's fears of being isolated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;8	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;9	Ties between NATO and Russia , he said , are `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;10	Despite Russia 's objections , NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes insisted , `` We are not ready to change any words in our decision '' ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the conditions for expansion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;11	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would be attached .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;12	The allies , though , have been hesitant about moving too quickly to admit their one-time foes for fear of upsetting and isolating Russia , still a formidable military power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;13	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , which was seen as a waiting room for East Europeans eager to join .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;14	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;15	On Thursday , the allies decided to push ahead and ordered a blueprint of terms , costs and conditions for expanding the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;16	But , mindful of Russia 's worries , they promised not to identify any front-runners for membership nor set any entry dates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0362;17	`` The Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did yesterday , and I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;0	The city health department on Friday opened a room where heroin addicts can take drugs in clean surroundings with fresh needles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;1	Backers of the project , which aims to convince 150 long-term addicts to try methadone or withdrawal treatment and stop the spread of AIDS , had to override objections from national officials who said it could encourage use of illegal drugs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;2	Similar `` junkie rooms '' have been set up in several European cities to entice addicts out of squalid conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;3	The Swiss cities Basel and Zurich have such places , and in the Netherlands , Rotterdam has a designated place by the central train station where junkies can do whatever they please .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;4	The Frankfurt drugs commissioner , Margarethe Nimsch , opened the so-called Gesundheitraum -- Health Room -- in an factory building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;5	A shuttle bus will carry addicts to the facility from the train station , which is next to a counseling office and a hostel for addicts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;6	`` It is a command of humanity to help addicts out of their misery and not to fence them out , '' Ms. Nimsch said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;7	Police and prosecutors have agreed to tolerate the project as long as those using it show they are over 18 and addicted but not in a withdrawal or methadone program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0363;8	They have to bring their own drugs -- sales on the premises are not permitted -- but fresh syringes are supplied .

APW_ENG_19941202.0364;31	But at a pro-Dudayev camp outside Grozny , 24-year-old Sergei Chicherov , a blue-eyed Cossack , had cast his lot with the Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0364;32	`` If someone comes and attacks your home , are you supposed to just sit and watch ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;0	Still angry about NATO 's plans to admit former Warsaw Pact members , Russia on Friday brushed aside attempts to get it to follow through on plans for close military links with the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;1	Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev refused to soften his opposition to a NATO blueprint setting out conditions for the entry of East European countries in the coming years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;2	He told a closed-door meeting of NATO and East European foreign ministers that Moscow could not move closer to the alliance until it provided more details about its intentions , sources said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;3	Kozyrev , they said , questioned whether there had been any change in NATO since it was a military machine arrayed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War era .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;4	On Thursday , he stunned U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by blasting the plan and backing out of a program for close military and political ties .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;5	He complained NATO 's proposals would create a new division on the European continent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;6	A day later , Christopher sought to play down the embarrassing incident , which ruined the alliance 's efforts to present a united front on the sensitive issue of expanding NATO territory farther east .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;7	He and others expressed confidence Moscow would eventually agree to a wide-ranging program of military and political contacts , which were designed to ease Russia 's fears of being isolated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;8	`` I think that will all get sorted out ... How soon I do n't know , '' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;9	Ties between NATO and Russia , he said , are `` too important to be lost . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;10	Despite Russia 's objections , NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes insisted , `` We are not ready to change any words in our decision '' ordering aides to conduct a 12-month study of the conditions for expansion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;11	Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and others have repeatedly demanded NATO membership and the security guarantees that would be attached .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;12	The allies , though , have been hesitant about moving too quickly to admit their one-time foes for fear of upsetting and isolating Russia , still a formidable military power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;13	At a summit last January , President Clinton and other allied leaders approved a U.S. initiative , Partnership for Peace , which was seen as a waiting room for East Europeans eager to join .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;14	Twenty-three nations , including Russia , have enrolled in the project , which allows them to take part for the first time in military exercises and other alliance activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;15	On Thursday , the allies decided to push ahead and ordered a blueprint of terms , costs and conditions for expanding the alliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;16	But , mindful of Russia 's worries , they promised not to identify any front-runners for membership nor set any entry dates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0365;17	`` The Russians will have a chance to analyze what we did yesterday , and I think they 'll find it to be responsible and deliberate , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;0	Joe Montana angrily denied a published report that he is retiring at the end of the American National Football League season on Friday and said that although he is injured , he is not yet finished with football .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;1	`` It 's ridiculous , '' the Kansas City quarterback said Friday at Arrowhead Stadium during his weekly news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;2	`` I had n't heard about it until I got here today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;3	I think , first of all , you guys are going to start having to stand up for what you write .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;4	It hurts the credibility of your field . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;5	In an exclusive story by NFL writer Gary Myers , the New York Daily News on Friday cited unidentified league sources as saying that Montana would retire when this season ended .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;6	`` All I can tell you is that I stand by story , '' Myers said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;7	Myers ' report was also broadcast Thursday night on the cable television program `` Inside the NFL . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;8	Montana sprained a foot in Sunday 's loss to Seattle and rumors started that he would be out for a lengthy period and would not be back next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;9	`` I 've got a sprained ankle and some guy writes that I 'm retiring , '' Montana said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;10	`` I had a hangnail last week and he did n't write about that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;11	`` It 's irritating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;12	It 's irritating that you have to put people through this .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;13	It 's irritating that I should have to stand up here and go through this , '' Montana said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;14	He said chances are `` pretty slim '' that he will be able to play against Denver Sunday in Kansas City .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;15	He said the ankle feels better but is still sore .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;16	Asked earlier about the New York Daily News report , Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore said that Montana has always said he would make no decision until after the end of the season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;17	Moore said `` it is just natural that from now until the end of the season there will be all kinds of speculation about Montana 's future plans . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;18	Montana , 38 , spent 14 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and helped them win four Super Bowls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;19	After playing just one game in 1991 and 1992 , he was traded to Kansas City in April , 1993 , along with safety David Whitmore and a third-round draft pick in exchange for a first-round draft choice that the 49ers later traded away .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;20	Montana was reported to have considered retirement last season after sustaining a concussion in Kansas City 's AFC championship game loss in Buffalo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0366;21	Until last Sunday , this season was relatively injury-free for Montana .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;0	Retired Gen. Colin Powell , former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said he was proud to help broker the controversial last-minute accord that averted a U.S. invasion of Haiti .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;1	Powell , a child of Jamaican immigrants , spoke at the University of the West Indies late Thursday after accepting the university 's honorary Doctor of Laws degree .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;2	`` I was pleased to be a member of the delegation that President Clinton sent to Haiti to persuade the generals and the colonels to step down , to tell them that their time had passsed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;3	To tell them that democracy had to return to Haiti , '' Powell said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;4	`` We succeeded without the need for an invasion which would have killed innocent young Haitians and innocent young Americans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;5	Instead we have the democratically elected president back in Port-au-Prince and American troops arrived as friends and not as enemies . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;6	Powell participated in a U.S. delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter that secured a Sept. 18 pledge by the Haitian military leaders to step down and allow the peaceful arrival of U.S. troops to prepare for the Oct. 15 return of elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;7	Some analysts criticized the accord as giving away too much to the Haitian coup leaders , who had ousted Aristide in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;8	Also , the Pentagon was relunctant to get involved in Haiti .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;9	However , since U.S. forces entered Haiti without major problems , U.S. military chiefs have said they should stay until they accomplish their U.N.-sanctioned mission , which is to create a safe environment that can be turned over to a U.N. peacekeeping force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;10	Powell , 57 , frequently mentioned as a possible contender for the U.S. presidency in 1996 , said , `` Haiti now begins the hard journey to real democracy and economic reform .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;11	It is a journey many other nations are taking ... in a spirit of reconciliation and moving away from all patterns of ideological confrontation . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;12	The former military chief said Jamaica and other Caribbean nations played vital roles in creating the conditions which allowed the U.S.-led forces to go into Haiti and restore democracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;13	Earlier in the day , Powell accepted the Order of Jamaica , the nation 's equivalent to knighthood in the British system .
APW_ENG_19941202.0367;14	Others who have received the University of the West Indies ' honorary degree include American civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King and South African President Nelson Mandela .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;0	The International Committee of the Red Cross will continue its humanitarian mission in Bosnia even if U.N. peacekeepers pull out , the organization 's president said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;1	The U.N. departure would be regretted `` because the presence of so many blue helmets has certainly had a deterrent effect to the conduct of war , '' Cornelio Sommaruga said , referring to the United Nations military force in the former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;2	Faced with an escalation of the fighting and increased harassment of the peacekeepers by Bosnian Serbs , U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said this week that the world body 's 23,000 soldiers may be withdrawn unless the warring sides agree to cooperate with the mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;3	There has been no indication , however , that a U.N. pullout , which would require a Security Council decision , is imminent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;4	Countries contributing the bulk of the U.N. troops , including Britain and France , also have said they would pull their men out if the fighting persists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;5	The Red Cross `` has a mission to protect and assist victims wherever there is a conflict , and this mission is completely independent from the U.N. , '' Sommaruga said in an interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;6	`` We would certainly continue to be there . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;7	In the past , there have been serious doubts whether scores of international humanitarian organizations , which have provided massive relief aid to needy Bosnians in the past 2 -LCB- years , could continue to operate if the peacekeepers withdrew .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;8	But the decision by a major relief supplier such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to remain in Bosnia may sway other groups to continue providing assistance in such an event .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;9	Sommaruga said the Geneva-based body already had prepared contingency plans for a possible U.N. withdrawal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0368;10	In addition to providing food and medical aid , the 130-year-old organization is engaged in tracing , visiting and freeing prisoners of war held by the various warring factions , and in reuniting families dispersed by the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;0	While the United Nations deliberates whether to continue operations in Bosnia , the Bosnian Serbs basically are deciding the issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;1	They 've virtually closed the mission down .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;2	Consider : -- Delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians is basic to the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;3	But Bosnian Serbs have refused to approve convoys through their territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;4	-- Sarajevo depends on the U.N. airlift for 80 percent of its supplies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;5	For more than a week , the up-again , down-again airlift has not flown because the Serbs refuse to approve flights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;6	To reinforce the message , the Serbs deployed surface-to-air missiles in the air corridor approaching Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;7	-- More than 400 peacekeepers , including French , British , Dutch , Canadians and Ukrainians , have been taken hostage against future NATO strikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;8	Apart from delivering humanitarian aid , the U.N. mission is supposed to enforce agreements , such as those on removal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area and on protection of U.N. `` safe areas . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;9	Those military functions have been severely curtailed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;10	The United Nations is unable even to get permission from the Bosnian Serbs to resupply its own units in isolated Muslim enclaves such as Bihac and Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;11	Most of the detained peacekeepers were guarding collection points in the Sarajevo area , where Bosnian Serbs stored heavy guns after last February 's NATO ultimatum to remove such weapons from within 12.5 miles of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;12	Both the Bosnian Serb and government forces routinely have put banned weapons in the zone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;13	Apart from bluff and bluster , the U.N. has found no tools to force compliance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;14	Last week , Bosnian Serb soldiers simply drove up to the nine collection points and surrounded them , trapping the peacekeepers inside .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;15	The presence of U.N. hostages virtually guarantees no NATO air strikes to follow three last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;16	U.N. relations with both sides have been touchy , and are getting worse .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;17	The Serbs are in a position to punish the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;18	Sources who attended a U.N. staff meeting Thursday quoted the commander for Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose , as saying that the Bosnian Serbs `` have declared war '' on the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;19	On Wednesday , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the Sarajevo airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;20	Boutros-Ghali had come to Sarajevo to warn the two sides that the United Nations might pull out of Bosnia-Herzegovina entirely if they did not cooperate with the peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;21	U.N. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , say they fear the Bosnian Serbs have decided to step up harassment in hopes the U.N. packs up and leaves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;22	During the past 2 -LCB- years , the United Nations has faced similar periods of harassment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;23	But U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , Thant Myint-U , described the current level of hostility as unprecedented .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;24	`` While we will certainly continue operations throughout the country in fulfillment of our various mandates as best we can , this unprecedented level of non-cooperation by the Bosnian Serb party is certainly not making our jobs any easier , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;25	Thant said the level of harassment is so intense and widespread that the United Nations believes it must have been approved at the highest level , presumably by Karadzic and his military chief , Gen. Ratko Mladic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0369;26	Since all U.N. operations here can only be carried out with the approval of the warring sides , absence of cooperation means the mission grinds to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;0	Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Warren was arrested after a car he was driving crashed into a utility pole , injuring him and two teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;1	One player , defensive tackle Michael Frier , suffered a serious neck injury .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;2	Warren , 27 , the fourth-leading rusher in the U.S. National Football League this season ; rookie running back Lamar Smith , 24 ; and a third player who was not unidentified pending notification of his parents , were taken to Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue after the Thursday night crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;3	Frier 's condition was improved from critical to serious on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;4	Team orthopedic surgeon Pierce Scranton refused to say whether Frier was paralyzed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;5	Warren , who suffered two cracked ribs , was treated and released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;6	Smith had chip fractures in his spine and ankle and was hospitalized overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;7	Warren , driving a Chevy Blazer -- a small truck-like vehicle , was arrested at the scene for investigation of vehicular assault , Sgt. Mark Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;8	Smith said it appeared Warren was driving too fast for the rain-slicked road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;9	The crash set the utility pole on fire and the players had to be pulled from the vehicle by passersby and firefighters , Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;10	Police would not comment on whether drugs or alcohol were involved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;11	Warren was released on his own recognizance , police dispatcher Jill Roberts said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;12	The accident happened about 8:40 p.m. near the team 's training center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;13	`` You read about it , you hear about it , but when it happens to somebody very close it really is a shock , '' Seahawks coach Tom Flores told KIRO radio early today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;14	`` It 's something that we all have to keep praying for that they all recover . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;15	The power line suspended on the pole was severed in the collision , causing a large electrical flash and disabling three substations , said Kristen Wappler , a spokeswoman for Puget Sound Power and Light Co.
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;16	The accident knocked out electricity to some 4,500 Puget Power customers for about an hour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;17	Warren , a fifth-year , Pro Bowl running back , is the first Seahawks player to rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;18	He started this week as the second-leading rusher in the American conference with 1,096 yards , just 5 yards behind San Diego 's Natrone Means .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;19	He also is second in the AFC in total yards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;20	The Seahawks play Indianapolis Sunday in the Kingdome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;21	The accident was the latest in a number of auto accidents involving NFL players this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;22	Dallas offensive lineman Erik Williams was lost for the season when he tore knee ligaments in an Oct. 24 crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;23	Williams pleaded no contest to drunken driving .
APW_ENG_19941202.0370;24	Teammate Shante Carver , a defensive end , also was involved in an accident in October when his speeding truck crashed into a concrete retaining wall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0371;0	While the United Nations deliberates whether to continue operations in Bosnia , the Bosnian Serbs basically are deciding the issue .

APW_ENG_19941202.0372;0	Part of an express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday , causing an undetermined number of deaths and injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;1	The state news agency MTI cited the National Ambulance Service as saying `` several people have died and the number of injured is high . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;2	Precise figures were not immediately available .
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;3	But doctors at one hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said 26 injured , including two critical cases , were admitted to their hospital alone , with several others also taking in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;4	The accident occurred at Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;5	The second car of the express train derailed , dragging three other cars with it and the overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0372;6	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0373;0	The Danish capital , already filled with bicyclists on city streets , is trying to get even more people on two wheels -- for free .

APW_ENG_19941202.0373;2	The money will be returned when the bike is taken back to any one of 200 racks throughout the city .
APW_ENG_19941202.0373;3	`` In a city where everyone is bicycling there 's a need for free bikes , '' said Bente Frost , Copenhagen 's transportation chief , after her first ride on a city bike .
APW_ENG_19941202.0373;4	Thirty percent of Copenhagen residents bike to work during the summer , and the city hopes the program will help the environment and curb bicycle thefts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0373;5	Each year about 27,000 bicycles are stolen in Copenhagen , costing insurance companies 41 million kroner -LRB- dlrs 6.7 million -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0373;6	Frost said up to 5,000 bicycles would be ready when Copenhagen becomes the European cultural capital in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;0	Nadia Comaneci completed a 10-day visit to her homeland by promising to return in 1996 to marry American fiance Bart Conner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;1	The 33-year-old gymnast , who scored the first-ever perfect 10 in the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games , said she was `` very moved '' by the warm welcome given her five years after she defected in what turned out to be the waning days of Communist rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;2	During her stay , she returned to her hometown , met the president and performed in front of the prime minister .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;3	`` People are more open , they are freer and say what they think .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;4	I know how it was before , '' she said in Romanian , translating for Conner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;5	Conner , a two-time Olympic gymnastics champion , spoke of the `` warm and exciting reception '' the couple received , saying the most memorable moment was when he asked Gheorghe Comeneci for his daughter 's hand in marriage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0375;6	Nadia Comaneci left Romania five years ago , a month before the collapse of the regime of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;0	Croatia and its rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement Friday touted as a framework for normalized relations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;1	But the worst Serb-Croat clashes in months cast doubt on the pact 's chances for success .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;2	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;3	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220-mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;4	Representatives of the Croatian government signed the accord Friday morning at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , with international mediators Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg as co-signers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;5	The document was then brought to Knin , rebel Serb headquarters , where their leaders signed it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;6	Croatia was effectively partitioned after a six-month war in 1991 at the start of the breakup of Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;7	A cease-fire in January 1992 halted the war , but left Serbs in control of a third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;8	Since then , thousands of skirmishes and larger clashes have threatened the truce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;9	On Friday , U.N. spokesman Michael Williams reported the fiercest battlefield clashes since the United Nations brokered another cease-fire last March .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;10	It was the third day of artillery duels around Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , Alexander Ivanko , another U.N. spokesman , said in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;11	Six Serb soldiers were reported wounded , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;12	Nevertheless , an international mediator said the agreement could be made to work .

APW_ENG_19941202.0376;17	Croatian Serb representative Borislav Mikelic , though signing the agreement , remained firm in the Serbs ' refusal to accept any reintegration with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;18	`` By signing this agreement we once more proved that we are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis here and we also showed that we 're interested in the economic progress and economic opening to Europe and the world , '' Mikelic said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0376;20	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0376;21	Negotiations between the two sides had been stalled .

APW_ENG_19941202.0378;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and key European foreign ministers met Friday , setting the stage for new overtures to the Bosnian Serbs for ending the war in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;1	The meeting with ministers of France , Britain , Russia and Germany came as the Bosnian Serbs tightened their grip on the mostly Muslim Bihac enclave and as the conflict threatened to spread into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;2	Two of the foreign ministers , Alain Juppe of France and Douglas Hurd of Britain , plan to carry a peace plan to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade Sunday in the hope he would recommend it to his allies in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;3	Before the ministers meeting , Christopher told reporters : `` I think it 's important we come out of it unified but also that we come out of it with effective steps . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;4	Juppe , as he left for the meeting of the five-nation `` contact group , '' acknowledged : `` It wo n't be easy ; that wo n't surprise you . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;5	Christopher wants Milosevic to threaten to seal Serbia 's border to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;6	Despite a promise to halt weapons deliveries , Clinton administration officials said , arms were still getting through to fuel the Bosnian Serbs ' drive to gain more territory and to terrorize civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;7	The war has taken an estimated 200,000 lives and left many times that number homeless .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;8	Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs , contributing to the decision by the U.N. commander , Sir Michael Rose , not to conduct heavy bombing raids against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;9	Christopher 's plan , which was adopted by President Clinton 's senior foreign policy advisers last Monday , calls for a cease-fire in the Bihac area , a cessation of hostilities for three to six months throughout Bosnia and a peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;10	There , the Bosnian Serbs would be able to promote their aspirations for a Greater Serbia , initially with political links to Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;11	They hope also to establish cross-border ties to ethnic Serbs in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;12	Elements of the plan are similar to one rejected repeatedly by the Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;13	It called for them to recognize Bosnia and to shrink the territory under their control to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;14	A federation of Muslims and Croats would be in charge of 51 percent of the war-torn country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;15	Even that division is negotiable once peace talks are resumed , U.S. officials said , hoping to induce the Serbs to halt their attacks and to negotiate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;16	Ironically , it was here at a NATO summit meeting in January that Clinton and allied leaders decided that NATO warplanes should be used to protect Bosnian Muslim civilians from attacks by rebel Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;17	But France and Britain prevailed in their resistance to a military approach .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;18	The Clinton administration has capitulated with some grumbling that the United Nations should have authorized sustained bombing and that the Bush administration that preceded Clinton 's should have done more than provide humanitarian assistance to trapped civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;19	In weighing diplomatic approaches , the five-nation group also considered a plan to urge Serbia to recognize the borders of Croatia and Bosnia make peace with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;20	The incentive would be an easing of economic sanctions against Milosevic 's government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;21	While the ministers are trying to enlist Milosevic , Christopher said , it would not be proper to have a further easing of sanctions against Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;22	When Milosevic promised to cut off arms supplies to Bosnian Serbs , some of the sanctions were lifted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;23	This included opening of the Belgrade airport .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;24	Again signaling a willingness to compromise with the Serbs , Christopher did not rule out political union between the Serbs in Bosnia with Serbia itself `` if it would mean reaching a peaceful resolution '' of the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0378;25	He said that was a constitutional issue the parties -- Serbs , Muslims and Croats -- should decide among themselves .

APW_ENG_19941202.0381;0	For a while , it looked like Union Carbide itself would not survive the worst industrial accident in history .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;1	But in the 10 years since a cyanide gas leak left nearly 4,000 people dead in Bhopal , India , Carbide has engineered a dramatic turnaround .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;2	Today , Carbide is a smaller , more focused company built around core chemicals businesses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;3	The company has sold or spun off most of its non-core divisions , shaved dlrs 575 million from its annual operating costs and radically cut its work force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;4	`` There 's no comparison to the Carbide that was and the Carbide that is , '' Carbide chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert D. Kennedy said in a recent interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;5	But no matter how well it fares financially , Union Carbide remains in the shadow of Bhopal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;6	It was early on Dec. 3 , 1984 that the company 's downward spiral began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;7	Methyl isocyanate gas , an ingredient in pesticides , leaked out of Carbide 's plant in Bhopal killing 3,800 people living nearby in crowded , dilapidated houses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;8	A legal battle over compensation for the victims of Bhopal went on for years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;9	Carbide , which concluded the gas leak was the result of employee sabotage , tried to defend itself from accusations by the Indian government and environmental groups who claimed the company did n't care enough about the indigent residents of Bhopal to take necessary safety precautions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;10	A Bhopal court issued a warrant for the arrest of former Carbide chairman Warren Anderson and unsuccessfully sought his extradition to face homicide charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;11	The legal problems caused by Bhopal were resolved in 1989 , when Carbide paid dlrs 470 million to settle the claims , as directed by the Supreme Court of India .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;12	There were other problems .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;13	Soon after the disaster , the company became the target of a takeover bid by GAF Corp. , a specialty chemicals maker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;14	As a defense , Carbide sold its profitable consumer products group -- including Glad garbage bags , Eveready batteries and Prestone antifreeze -- and bought back 56 percent of its own stock .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;15	In the process , the company saddled itself with dlrs 3.3 billion in new debt and made it difficult to diversify into other businesses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;16	Sales dropped from approximately dlrs 9.99 billion in 1980 to dlrs 6.39 billion in 1985 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;17	Over the next few years , Carbide spun off non-core businesses including pesticides , silicones and , in 1992 , Linde , its industrial gases unit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;18	Union Carbide is almost unrecognizable from its pre-Bhopal days as a conglomerate with about 20 different businesses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;19	Its worldwide work force has been slashed dramatically -- from 98,400 in 1984 to about 12,000 today .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;20	The company is even looking to lease out space at its sprawling Danbury headquarters , built before the Bhopal accident and now too large for the new , leaner Carbide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;21	Wall Street seems to approve of the redesigned Carbide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;22	`` Bhopal almost destroyed the company .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;23	It was the beginning of a series of problems ... but today I 'd call it a big Wall Street success story , '' said James Hickman , a chemicals industry analyst at CS First Boston in New York .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;24	`` -LRB- The turnaround -RRB- involved some divestiture , some head count reductions and efficiency improvements , and the market -- skeptical at first -- ultimately rewarded the company , and the stock price improved dramatically , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;25	The company 's shares appreciated almost 35 percent in 1993 to close at dlrs 22.375 , the fifth-best performance for the year among the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial list .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;26	Today it is trading in the high dlrs 20 range .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;27	Analysts credit the company 's cost-cutting program for the company 's revival .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;28	In late 1990 , Carbide announced a plan to cut dlrs 200 million from its operating budget by the end of 1994 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;29	Within a year , the company increased that target to dlrs 400 million , and in 1993 , to dlrs 575 million , a goal the company said it will reach by the end of this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;30	`` That transformed them from a high-cost producer to one of the lower cost producers , '' said Paul Raman , an analyst with S.G. Warburg , a New York investment bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;31	But critics are still mindful of Bhopal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0381;32	Environmental groups are familiar fixtures at the company 's annual stockholders ' meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;0	A former Christian warlord standing trial on charges of bombing a church and killing a rival politician said Friday he did not commit murder and complained of mistreatment in prison .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;1	Samir Geagea , 43 , was the leader of the Lebanese Forces , the Christians ' main militia until it was disarmed in 1990 at the end of Lebanon 's 15-year civil war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;2	Friday 's session was devoted to the murder of Dany Chamoun , 56 , his half-German wife Ingrid Abdel-Noor , and their two sons , Tarek , 7 , and Julien , 5 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;3	They were killed by unidentified gunmen who broke into their house in suburban Baabda east of Beirut at dawn on Oct. 21 , 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;4	Chamoun headed the right-wing National Liberal Party , long at odds with Geagea 's Lebanese Forces , which ruled most of the Christian hinterland north and northeast of Beirut during the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;5	Geagea faces the death penalty if convicted of either charge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;6	He told the judges he did not kill Chamoun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;7	`` You should realize that we are innocent and that we have been framed , '' Geagea said in his first comments in court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;8	`` I have been held for 250 days in a cell without light ... sometimes blindfolded , '' Geagea told the five-judge tribunal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;9	`` In our cell I can sometimes hear screams '' coming from elsewhere in the Defense Ministry detention center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;10	In the other case , Geagea is accused of masterminding an explosion at a church in the Christian port city of Jounieh on Feb. 27 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;11	Eleven worshipers were killed and 60 were wounded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;12	Also on trial for the two crimes are four Geagea aides , including his chief of staff , Fuad Malek .
APW_ENG_19941202.0382;13	Fourteen others , including his top security chief , Ghassan Touma , are being tried on the same charges in absentia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;0	A U.N. commission of experts reiterated charges Friday that Hutu leaders were guilty of genocide against the minority Tutsi group in Rwanda , adding to legal evidence that may be brought before a war crimes tribunal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;1	In its final report to the U.N. Security Council , the three-man panel said it had been unable to find evidence that the new Tutsi-led Royal Patriotic Front government had instigated systematic killings after it assumed power last July .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;2	However , it added that it was `` disturbed by ongoing violence committed by some RPF soldiers , '' and recommended that investigations should continue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;3	It said it had not had enough time itself to complete the inquiry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;4	U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ordered the commission to check into alleged massacres by RPF soldiers after the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said they had carried out reprisal killings of up to 30,000 people late August and early September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;5	The government arrested some of its own soldiers after the allegations but maintains it is powerless to clamp down on all abuses because of lack of international help to restore the shattered law and order system .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;6	The commission 's final report added added little to its interim conclusions issued in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;7	`` After careful deliberation , the Commission of Experts has concluded that there exists overwhelming evidence to prove that acts of genocide against the Tutsi group were perpetrated by Hutu elements in a concerted , planned , systematic and methodical way , '' the 58-page document said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;8	Atsu-Koffi Amega , a former judge from Togo , heads the commission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;9	The other members are Salifou Fomba , a law professor from Mali , and Haby Dieng , a prosecutor from Guinea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;10	Their work is in addition to inquiries carried out by the U.N. Human Rights Center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;11	The Security Council voted last month to set up an international tribunal for genocide in Rwanda , with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for those found guilty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;12	However , it may be months before a tribunal starts work , and the Rwandan government objects to the U.N. plans because they exclude the death penalty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;13	An estimated 500,000 people , mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus , were massacred by the Hutu army and militias after the death of the Hutu president in a mysterious plane crash April 6 released an orgy of violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0383;14	Many of those accused of the worst atrocities are now sheltering in refugee camps in neighboring Zaire and there are fears that -- with the help of international aid -- they are preparing a violent invasion of Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;0	John , Paul , George and Ringo have a new record in British and Irish shops this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;1	So does Pope John Paul II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;2	The pope is featured on half of a double album , reciting the rosary in Latin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;3	The other half is a recording of an Irish priest , the Rev. Colm Kilcoyne , reciting the rosary in English .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;4	The recording of the pope , made from a Vatican Radio broadcast , was first sold in Spain , said Colin Elms , national account executive for Telstar Records PLC of London .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;5	The recording came out two days before EMI released double album `` Live At the BBC , '' a collection of Beatles ' recordings from the 1960s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;6	The pope 's disc was a best seller in Spain , and a platinum record was presented to the pope at the Vatican three weeks ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0384;7	In Britain , the recording entered the chart at No. 52 at midweek , indicating sales of about 4,000 in three days , Elms said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;0	Bosnian Serb gunners ringing Sarajevo fired five anti-tank missiles at the capital Friday , including two which hit government headquarters minutes before the chief U.N. envoy arrived for talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;1	It was yet another sign of the contempt with which Serbs hold the United Nations mission to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;2	More than 300 U.N. peacekeepers remained hostages of the Serbs , as insurance against further NATO airstrikes , but 70 were released Friday after being detained for seven days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;3	Two missiles hit the Bosnian presidency building , which houses the offices of the top government officials , minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;4	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic moments after he left for the Akashi meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;5	Lazovic is an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;6	Later , three missiles hit nearby buildings as Akashi met in the presidency with top government and military officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;7	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;8	`` Until we achieve something tangible , this shuttle diplomacy must continue , '' Akashi told reporters in Sarajevo before leaving for Pale , the Bosnian Serb headquarters east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;9	But the Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for failing to use the necessary force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , even as fighting continued in that northwest region Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;10	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;11	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , referring to European capitulation to Adolf Hitler before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;12	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic that presumably focused on a proposed new peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;13	Redman , now ambassador to Germany , helped draft the first Contact Group peace plan , which the Serbs have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;14	Although that proposal was presented to the Serbs as a take-it-or-leave-it plan , the lack of Western will to use force has allowed the Serbs to demand , apparently successfully , the right of future confederal links with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;15	The original plan denied Serbs that as punishment for starting the war , though it granted the Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation similar rights to link with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;16	Akashi , on a mission to end the peacekeepers ' detention and win freedom of movement for U.N. convoys , hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;17	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed in even trying to meet the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides might force the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;18	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , Friday after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;19	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , along with hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;20	In New York , Russia and Ukraine issued a statement Friday calling on U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the UNPROFOR command to take `` all appropriate measures ... to facilitate the release of all captured or detained UNPROFOR personnel . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;21	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic fighting around the government enclave of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;22	The United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;23	A number of detonations were reported on the outskirts of Bihac Friday , along with machine-gun and small arms fire , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;24	But the heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;25	The Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave , part of which is a U.N. `` safe area , '' in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;26	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;27	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;28	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;29	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia also had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0385;30	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;0	CourmAosta of Italy , helped by Dallas Star Dave Gagner , won a semifinal game Friday in the `` Six Nations '' tournament of European professional ice hockey teams , beating Austria 's Villach 3-1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;1	Gagner and Pittsburgh Penguin star Jaromir Jagr are taking part courtesy of the labor dispute that has stilled the NHL season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;2	`` I did not play a great game today , and the team did not either , '' Gagner said . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;3	Villach is a very good defensive team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;4	They play just like the North American style -- they clutch and grab -- and it was very hard to find open ice . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;5	Villach scored first at 19:29 of the first period with a goal by Gerald Ressmann .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;6	Bob Reynolds tied it for CourmAosta at 10:41 of the second period .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;7	Courmaosta scored two more in the third , with a goal at 11:08 by Sim Camazzola and at 11:43 by Alberto Scapinello .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;8	Teams from Austria , Italy , Slovenia , France , Holland and Denmark were invited to the tournament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0386;9	Gagner signed to play part of the Italian season for CourmAosta after the NHL season was put on hold , and Jagr has contracted to play in the tournament for Wurth Bolzano .

APW_ENG_19941202.0388;0	Accusing Iran 's Islamic regime of giving the orders , prosecutors Friday demanded a life sentence for an Iranian accused of leading a commando team that murdered former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;1	Prosecutor Jacques Mouton , saying the assassination was carried out `` with perfect mastery in perfect cold blood , '' demanded terms of 13-15 years for two other defendants , accused of helping the killers enter France and escape .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;2	Bakhtiar , an exiled opposition leader , and his secretary , Soroush Katibeh , were strangled and slashed to death Aug. 6 , 1991 , at his home in suburban Paris .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;3	Police guards failed to detect the murders for two days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;4	Presenting five hours of final arguments to the special anti-terrorist court , Mouton said that the killers walked away from the `` butchery '' with a calm that amounted to disdain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;5	Mouton asked for a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years behind bars for the alleged leader of the hit team , Ali Vakili Rad , 35 , who was arrested in Switzerland 15 days after the killing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;6	The other two accused assassins got away .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;7	Vakili Rad claims he actually belonged to Bakhtiar 's opposition group but was duped by his cohorts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;8	Mouton called him a liar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;9	Vakili Rad and the other defendants -- Massoud Hendi , 47 , once Paris bureau chief of the Islamic Republic Broadcasting Network , and Zeynalabedine Sarhadi , 28 , an archivist at Iran 's embassy in Bern , Switzerland -- mount their final defense in the month-long trial Monday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;10	The seven-judge panel will render its verdict Monday or Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;11	Reviewing tomes of evidence , Mouton spared no words for Iran , suggesting the Islamic state was implicated through a vast , complicated network with its hub in Tehran officialdom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;12	The Iranian Ministry of Telecommunications `` was at the heart of this assassination , '' Mouton said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;13	Many of the dozens of telephone calls at critical moments before and after the murder were traced by the French secret service to the ministry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;14	Among the suspects France wants to try but remain at large is Hossein Sheikhattar , who headed the ministry 's satellite division .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;15	Hendi said in testimony that Sheikhattar asked him to procure visas for two of the suspected killers , including Vakili Rad .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;16	The Iranian Embassy in Paris has denied any role by the government in the slayings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;17	At least 63 Iranians have been killed in exile since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0388;18	But , if the defendants are found guilty , this would be the first trial directly implicating the regime .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;0	American Hilary Lindh earned her second career World Cup victory , capturing the opening women 's downhill race of the season on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;1	Lindh , 25 , prevailed by 29-hundredths of a second over Isolde Kostner of Italy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;2	Defending World Cup downhill champion Katja Seizinger of Germany finished third .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;3	Austria 's Stefanie Schuster overcame a late start number to finish a career-best fourth , Switzerland 's Heidi Zurbriggen was fifth , and Sweden 's Pernilla Wiberg took sixth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;4	Lindh , winning on a course that she admitted did n't fit her style because of tight turns at the bottom , was timed in 1 minute , 45.00 seconds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;5	Her best previous finish on this course was sixth place two years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;6	Kostner , the last of the top-seeded skiers to complete the run , could n't overcome Lindh 's solid effort , coming across in 1:45.29 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;7	Seizinger was timed in 1:45.44 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;8	Three other favorites -- Anja Haas of Austria , Melanie Suchet of France and American Picabo Street -- fell and did not finish .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;9	Street made a minor mistake early in her run and , in an effort to make up time , got out of control near the finish , did the splits and crashed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;10	Haas had the fastest intermediate time one-third of the way down the course when she fell .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;11	Lindh , the 1992 Olympic downhill silver medalist , posted her first victory on the World Cup circuit last February in Sierra Nevada , Spain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;12	For the first time , downhillers in the top seed of 15 were allowed to select starting numbers from 1 through 30 , and most of the favorites chose numbers in the 20s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0391;13	The course appeared to speed up slightly during the race as a bright sun glazed the snow , making it slicker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0392;0	Part of an express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday , its cars sliding into a station building and burying passengers underneath the rubble .

APW_ENG_19941202.0392;5	He said in a telephone interview that people remained buried in the wreckage more than four hours after the crash , which occured at 4:45 p.m. local time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0392;6	National Police Maj. Imre Olah said 20 deaths had been confirmed `` but that 's not the final count by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0392;7	Ambulance crews taking victims to the hospital said between 20 and 40 people were believed injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0392;8	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said 26 injured , including two critical cases , were admitted to their hospital alone , with several others also taking in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0392;9	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;0	Serbian police have arrested 156 ethnic Albanians , all former police officers , who they claim were plotting rebellion in Kosovo province , the public prosecutor announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;1	In the first official confirmation of the crackdown over the past ten days , Serbian prosecutor Miodrag Brkljac said the ethnic Albanians were members of an illegal group which planned `` armed rebellion against '' Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;2	It was the biggest police raid in Kosovo since 1989 when Serbia revoked the autonomy of its southern province , where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 1.9 million population .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;3	Serbian police now keep a firm grip on any ethnic Albanian dissent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;4	Ethnic Albanian officials deny planning any armed rebellion against Serbia , saying that would be against their peaceful resistance policy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0393;5	Serbia regards Kosovo as the cradle of its history and culture and has vowed never to give it up to the ethnic Albanians who seek independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;0	Expectations of continued robust strength for the economy were tempered Friday by reports suggesting the pace could slacken next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;1	The government 's main forecasting gauge of future economic activity fell in October for the first time in 15 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;2	Also , new orders to U.S. factories slipped for the first time in three months as demand for cars and other transportation equipment plummeted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;3	`` The slowdown is still an expectation rather than a reality , '' said economist Norman Robertson of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;4	The data `` tend to suggest that sometime in 1995 we will see a slower-paced expansion . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;5	The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined 0.1 percent in October after edging up 0.1 percent in September and climbing 0.5 percent in August .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;6	When the index moves in the same direction for three straight months , it is considered a sign of an economic trend six months down the road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;7	Analysts had expected the index to rise moderately in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;8	But seven of its 11 components fell , led by a slower rate of increase for raw material prices due largely to declines for some paper products .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;9	Other negative factors in the index were a slowing in business orders for plant and equipment , higher weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance , lower money supply , fewer building permits , lower stock prices and declining unfilled orders for durable goods .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;10	The four components that made positive contributions to the index were slower business delivery times that usually are a sign of rising orders , increased average workweek , rising consumer expectations and more new orders for consumer goods .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;11	The Commerce Department also said that factory orders fell 0.4 percent in October after a rise of less than 0.1 percent the previous month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;12	The decrease , caused by an 8.8 percent drop in transportation equipment led by declining car demand , was expected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;13	The reports softened somewhat the impact of other data that pointed to a still-surging economy and possible rising inflation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;14	The Labor Department said unemployment fell to 5.6 percent in November , its lowest rate in four years , as a seasonally adjusted 350,000 new workers were added to the nation 's nonfarm payrolls ,
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;15	Reports earlier in the week signaled brisk growth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;16	Analysts said they doubt the Federal Reserve will move this month to raise short-term interest rates a seventh time this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;17	`` I suppose they do n't want to be Scrooge-like and do it before Christmas , '' said Robertson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;18	`` And there are ambiguities in the numbers . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;19	The Federal Open Market Committee , which sets policy for the Federal Reserve , next meets on Dec. 20 and then has a two-day meeting concluding Feb. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;20	New factory orders , a key gauge of the nation 's manufacturing sector , have risen in 13 of the last 15 months including a 4.7 percent jump in August that was led by auto demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;21	They last fell in July , when they were off 2 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0394;22	Excluding the volatile transportation component , orders rose 0.9 percent in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;0	Croatia and its rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement Friday touted as a framework for normalized relations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;1	But the worst Serb-Croat clashes in months cast doubt on the pact 's chance for success .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;2	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;3	Two sections of the 360-kilometer -LRB- 220-mile -RRB- highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;4	Representatives of the Croatian government signed the accord Friday morning at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , with international mediators Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg as co-signers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;5	The document was then brought to Knin , rebel Serb headquarters , where their leaders signed it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;6	Croatia was effectively partitioned after a six-month war in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;7	A cease-fire in January 1992 halted the war , but left Serbs in control of a third of Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;8	Since then , thousands of skirmishes and bigger clashes have threatened the truce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;9	On Friday , U.N. spokesman Michael Williams reported the fiercest clashes since the United Nations brokered another cease-fire last March .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;10	It was the third day of artillery duels around Lake Peruca , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- southeast of Knin , Alexander Ivanko , another U.N. spokesman , said in Zagreb .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;11	Six Serb soldiers were reported wounded , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;12	Nevertheless , an international mediator said the agreement could be made to work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;13	`` The significance of the agreement is going to depend on the parties to the agreement , '' Owen told The Associated Press in Knin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;14	The two sides `` have it in their power to implement the agreement if they want to , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;15	But he warned : `` This agreement can easily be blown up literally and metaphorically .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;16	The fighting is continued challenge to it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;17	Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , on a three-day visit to Argentina , called the agreement `` an important step toward the total return of our occupied territories . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;18	He said , however , if Serbs refuse to relinquish the territory , `` Croatia will resort to other means , backed by the international community . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;19	He did not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;20	Croatian Serb representative Borislav Mikelic , though signing the accord , remained firm in the Serbs ' refusal to accept any reintegration with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;21	`` By signing this agreement we once more proved that we are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis here and we also showed that we 're interested in the economic progress and economic opening to Europe and the world , '' Mikelic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;22	But he refused to discuss the crucial overall political solution , saying , `` This is not the time to talk about it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;23	The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly approved the economic accord late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;24	Negotiations between the two sides had been stalled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;25	But the Croatian Serbs relented after a recent meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , the Balkans ' power broker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;26	Thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed between the warring sides in the disputed territories since the 1992 cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;27	But international efforts toward lasting peace have failed over what seemed to be irreconcilable differences .
APW_ENG_19941202.0396;28	This is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a formal cease-fire to end their 1991 war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;0	Sweden 's new government is trying to retake a central role alongside Norway in the Middle East peace process after a three-year hiatus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;1	The government 's initiative features an unusual trip to Israel this weekend by an ex-foreign minister to hammer out an economic assistance plan for Palestinian territories .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;2	Sweden 's `` concrete plan '' will detail immediate improvements in conditions for Gaza and the West Bank , the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;3	Sweden hopes the effort , undertaken at the request of Israel and the PLO , will include `` political '' issues , said the official , Sten Andersson , who was involved in talks leading to the 1991 Madrid peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;4	`` This is social and economic and political , '' Andersson told The Associated Press before leaving Sweden Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;5	`` It 's high time for Sweden to do something .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;6	The peace process is in a very critical stage right now .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;7	There must be some signs for the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- population that something will happen . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;8	Administration and economic development in Gaza are priorities for Arafat , who is facing pressure from Islamic radicals because of dismal conditions in the territories .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;9	Israeli officials have hinted they want to speed up the process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;10	In Brussels this week , foreign donors released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier for the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;11	Among the plans already under consideration are job-creation programs and the establishment of an industrial zone along Gaza 's borders to attract investment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;12	Andersson , 71 , declined to detail his initiative , other than saying he had `` new '' ideas which could be included in the plan to be discussed in Stockholm Dec. 12 by PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;13	Sweden 's neighbor , Norway , already has been deeply involved in the peace process since the country established its acclaimed `` Oslo Channel '' two years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;14	That channel led to last year 's peace treaty signed in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;15	In what may be mainly a footnote to history , Sweden 's new initiative arises from a domestic political feud and a friendly rivalry with Norway for the mantle of peacemaker in the Middle East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;16	Swedish officials , led by Andersson , had been intimately involved in Israeli-Palestinian contacts until 1991 , when the Social Democrats lost elections to a center-conservative coalition led by former Prime Minister Carl Bildt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;17	According to Andersson and other officials , the Social Democrats at the time had close contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization , whose leader Arafat was looking for a third country to foster contacts with Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;18	`` The -LRB- conservative -RRB- Bildt government was very passive , that was a pity , '' said Andersson , a career Social Democrat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;19	`` So then I recommended to the PLO that they go to the Norwegians . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;20	Norway 's government was led by Social Democrats also .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;21	Palestinians then turned to Norwegian diplomats to set up talks which eventually led to the `` Oslo Channel , '' a Scandinavian diplomat involved with the talks said on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;22	The diplomat , however , said the relationship had been established well before the change of power in Sweden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;23	`` It 's probably true that Sten Andersson suggested Norway , and suggested to Norway that we help , '' the diplomat said by telephone from Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;24	`` The fact that we -LRB- already -RRB- had good relations was the reason . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;25	Andersson , now retired , insisted the new Social Democratic government , which returned to power last September , was not trying to take over Norway 's role in the peace process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;26	`` The Norwegians have done a magnificent job and I 'm not here to compete with them , '' Andersson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0398;27	Bildt 's spokeswoman referred all questions about the period to Bildt or his former aides , none of whom could be reached for comment Friday .

APW_ENG_19941202.0400;0	Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Warren was arrested after a car he was driving crashed into a utility pole , injuring him and two teammates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0400;1	One of the teammates , defensive tackle Michael Frier , suffered a serious neck injury , and is largely paralyzed , a doctor said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0400;2	Frier has no use of his legs or hands and only minimal muscle function in his upper arms , Dr. Michael Schlitt told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0400;3	Frier suffered a broken and dislocated neck between the fifth and sixth vertebrae and his spinal cord was `` severely injured , '' Schlitt said at Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue .

APW_ENG_19941202.0400;11	Warren , driving a Chevy Blazer -- a small truck-like vehicle , was arrested at the scene for investigation of vehicular assault , Sgt. Mark Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0400;12	Smith said it appeared Warren was driving too fast for the rain-slicked road .

APW_ENG_19941202.0400;16	The accident happened about 8:40 p.m. near the team 's training center .

APW_ENG_19941202.0400;19	The power line suspended on the pole was severed in the collision , causing a large electrical flash and disabling three substations , said Kristen Wappler , a spokeswoman for Puget Sound Power and Light Co.

APW_ENG_19941202.0414;0	Tackle Michael Frier suffered a paralyzing spinal cord injury when a car driven by his Seattle Seahawks teammate , star running back Chris Warren , crashed into a utility pole .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;1	Warren , the fourth leading rusher in the American National Football League , suffered two cracked ribs , was treated at the hospital and released about 1 a.m. Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;2	Little-used rookie running back Lamar Smith had chip fractures in his spine and ankle and was hospitalized overnight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;3	Warren , driving a Chevy Blazer -- a truck-like vehicle , was arrested at the accident scene Thursday night for investigation of vehicular assault , Sgt. Mark Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;4	Frier has no use of his legs or hands and only minimal muscle function in his upper arms , Dr. Michael Schlitt told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;5	Frier -- a 1.96-meter -LRB- 6-foot-5 -RRB- , 135-kilogram -LRB- 299-pound -RRB- defensive lineman -- suffered a broken and dislocated neck between the fifth and sixth vertebrae and his spinal cord was `` severely injured , '' Schlitt said at Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;6	`` The likelihood that he will play football again is zero , '' Schlitt said of Frier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;7	`` The likelihood of walking is very poor . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;8	Frier will `` regain a little bit more use of the arms ... but it 's doubtful he will have normal function of the hands . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;9	Frier was scheduled to undergo surgery this afternoon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;10	Smith said it appeared Warren was driving too fast for the rain-slicked road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;11	The crash set the utility pole on fire and the players had to be pulled from the vehicle by passersby and firefighters , Smith said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;12	Police would not comment on whether drugs or alcohol were involved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;13	Schlitt and Seahawks coach and general manager Tom Flores , who also attended the news conference , also would not discuss that issue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;14	Warren was released on his own recognizance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;15	Vehicular assault is a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison , although the standard sentencing range under state guidelines is three to nine months in jail , said Dan Donohoe , spokesman for the King County prosecutor 's office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;16	The charge alleges a defendant caused serious harm to another person as a result of driving a vehicle in a reckless manner or while under the influence of drugs or alcohol .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;17	Donohoe said it might be a day or two before a decision is made whether to file charges against Warren .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;18	Warren , a fifth-year , Pro Bowl running back , is the first Seahawks player to rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;19	He started this week as the second-leading rusher in the AFC with 1,096 yards , just 5 yards behind San Diego 's Natrone Means .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;20	He also is second in the AFC in total yards .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;21	Frier is a third-year player signed as a free agent Nov. 2 after he was released by the Cincinnati Bengals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;22	He has played in three Seahawks games this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;23	The Seahawks play Indianapolis Sunday in the Kingdome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;24	The accident was the latest in a number of auto accidents involving NFL players this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;25	Dallas offensive lineman Erik Williams was lost for the season when he tore knee ligaments in an Oct. 24 crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0414;26	Williams pleaded no contest to drunken driving .

APW_ENG_19941202.0415;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;1	Yasushi Akashi , speaking at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , told reporters he had won assurances that Ukrainian peacekeepers kidnapped in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;2	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;3	Serbs had detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia for more than a week as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;4	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;5	The U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia also said the Serbs had promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;6	Akashi said he was pleased with the `` willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;7	Whether the promises would be fulfilled remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;8	Earlier Friday , they once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency minutes before Akashi arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;9	Karadzic promised Bosnian Serbs would normalize relations with the United Nations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;10	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;11	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;12	It was not immediately clear whether Karadzic 's comments hinted at potential stumbling blocks to carrying out the promises Akashi announced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0415;13	`` More or less , we can say we are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;0	Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard had his left leg amputated after being attacked by a strain of flesh-eating bacteria , but is out of danger , doctors said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;1	Bouchard , 55 , the most popular leader in Canada 's largest French-speaking province , vowed to continue his political career , dedicated to making Quebec an independent country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;2	`` Mr. Bouchard has greatly improved over the past 12 hours , '' Dr. Patrick d'Amico told a news conference at Montreal 's St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;3	D'Amico said Bouchard had undergone three operations since being admitted to the hospital earlier this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;4	The left leg was amputated at mid-thigh in an operation during which he was conscious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;5	If no further complications occur , Bouchard should recover fully in about three or four months , said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;6	Earlier Friday , rumors circulated that Bouchard was on the verge of death , but hospital officials dismissed them as untrue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;7	News of Bouchard 's illness shook Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;8	Small groups of people , some bearing Quebec flags , kept an all-night vigil outside the hospital under a light snowfall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;9	Bouchard was struck by a rare disease known as necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as the `` flesh-eating disease . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;10	Doctors say the disease is caused by the streptococcus A bacteria and is fatal in 80 percent of the cases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;11	The bacteria is common and usually results in sore throats or tonsilitis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;12	But in about one in a million cases , it turns deadly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;13	Bouchard , a former Conservative Cabinet minister , bolted former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 's government in 1990 and formed his own party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;14	The new party became , effectively , the national arm of the Parti Quebecois , the provincial party dedicated to the secession of Quebec and its 7 million inhabitants from Canada .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;15	In the 1993 federal elections , the Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats to become the official opposition to the ruling Liberals in the House of Commons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;16	Few wanted to speculate on what the absence of Bouchard would have on the political scene or the referendum on independence expected next year in Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;17	Politicians of all political stripes expressed their concern for Bouchard 's health and wished him well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;18	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , on a trip to France , said : `` I speak not only for the government of Canada , but also for the people of Canada when I express to Mr. Bouchard and his family our deep regrets and our sincere wish for a rapid return of his health . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;19	The disease struck Bouchard suddenly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;20	Last weekend he had attended a party congress , though he complained of having the flu .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;21	On Tuesday , he was diagnose with phlebitis , an inflammation of a vein in his leg , and was admitted to St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;22	Dr. Pierre Ghosn , head of cardiovascular surgery , said he operated to relieve pressure in the leg and discovered the disease .
APW_ENG_19941202.0416;23	A third operation was necessary to remove infection found in the abdomen and
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;0	In its final report to the Security Council , a U.N. commission again charged Rwanda 's Hutu leaders with genocide and said Friday it could find no evidence the new government engaged in systematic killings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;1	The findings , particularly of genocide , add to the legal evidence that may be used against any Hutu leaders brought before a war crimes tribunal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;2	But the commission 's final report added little to its initial conclusions in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;3	The 58-page document explicitly blamed Hutus for mass killings carried out `` in a concerted , planned , systematic and methodical way . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;4	An estimated 500,000 people , mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus , were massacred by the Hutu army and militias after the death of the Hutu president in a mysterious plane crash on April 6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;5	Many of those accused of the worst atrocities are now sheltering in refugee camps in neighboring Zaire and there are fears that -- with the help of international aid -- they are preparing a violent invasion of Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;6	The three-man panel said it had been unable to find evidence that the new Tutsi-led Royal Patriotic Front government had instigated systematic killings after it assumed power last July .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;7	But it added that it was `` disturbed by ongoing violence committed by some RPF soldiers , '' and recommended that investigations should continue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;8	It said it had not had enough time itself to complete the inquiry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;9	Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ordered the commission to check into alleged massacres by RPF soldiers after some U.N. officials said they had carried out reprisal killings of up to 30,000 people in August and September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0417;10	The government arrested some of its own soldiers after the allegations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;0	An express train derailed Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station southeast of Budapest and burying people under the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;1	At least 20 people were killed , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;2	The accident occurred at 4:45 p.m. in Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;3	The second car of the train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and the overturned carriages crashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;4	`` There was a tremedous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;5	He said in a telephone interview that people remained buried in the wreckage more than four hours after the crash .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;6	National Police Maj. Imre Olah said 20 deaths had been confirmed , `` but that 's not the final count by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;7	Ambulance crews said between 20 and 40 people were believed injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;8	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok said 26 injured people , including two critical cases , had been admitted to their hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;9	Several other hospitals were also taking in the injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0418;10	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest , to the capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0419;0	An express train derailed Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station southeast of Budapest and burying people under the rubble .

APW_ENG_19941202.0420;0	Marking a milestone in Taiwan 's shift to democracy , Taiwanese voters go to the polls Saturday in the toughest electoral test for the island 's Nationalist rulers in 45 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;1	The elections are part of the reforms initiated by the Nationalists , who ruled by martial law until unleashing a bloodless democratic revolution in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;2	Voters will elect a Taiwan governor , mayors for Taipei and Kaohsiung -- the island 's two largest cities -- local councilors and provincial assemblymen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;3	Polling stations open at 8 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- , and results are expected about eight hours after polls close at 4 p.m. -LRB- 0800GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;4	Newspapers predicted up to 70 percent of Taiwan 's 13.8 million eligible voters would turn out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;5	The polls also are a prelude to Taiwan 's first direct presidential election in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;6	President Lee Teng-hui 's prospects for another term will be measured by his Nationalists ' performance Saturday against the main opposition , the Democratic Progressive Party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;7	The Nationalists fled to Taiwan to escape the 1949 Communist takeover of mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;8	They still say they hope one day to reunite Taiwan with the Chinese motherland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;9	But the DPP advocates Taiwanese independence , something China has vowed to resist by force , and DPP successes Saturday could bring warnings from Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;10	The campaigning has focused largely on `` Tong-Du '' -- reunification vs. independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;11	To the annoyance of the DPP , business leaders placed newspaper ads days before the poll warning that Taiwan 's dollar and the island 's standing with investors could plummet if pro-independence forces gain power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;12	But the DPP may profit from a split in the Nationalist vote caused by the recently formed New Party , which quit the Nationalists last year after accusing them of abandoning the commitment to reunification .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;13	The DPP 's Chen Shui-bian is thought to be a frontrunner in the race fo Taipei mayor , while Nationalist James Soong has a 50-40 lead over the DPP 's Chen Ting-nan in the gubernatorial race , according to latest surveys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;14	Candidates held final rallies Friday night , including tens of thousands of cheering New Party supporters who packed Taipei 's municipal stadium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;15	The feverish election campaign , which sometimes resembled a carnival , is a sign of Taiwanese enthusiasm for democracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;16	Taipei 's streets and many of its taxis were covered with flags .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;17	In the last few days , campaigners lulled the capital to sleep at night with drums and roused it each morning with firecrackers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;18	Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung even complained that precious resources were wasted and that the campaign flags `` could have clothed 1 million refugees . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;19	But there also were occasions when enthusiasm and heated debate spilled over into violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;20	Riot police were often at campaign rallies and 50,000 officers were to be deployed to keep order Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;21	In a statement Friday , President Lee appealed for calm on polling day so Taiwan can `` welcome a new era of democracy for all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;22	Other officials appealed to voters not to take bribes , a problem in past elections as well as this one .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;23	The DPP filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the Nationalists of earmarking about 150 million Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 5.6 million -RRB- to buy votes for Huang Ta-chou , Taipei 's incumbent Nationalist mayor , who is lagging in opinion polls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;24	The Nationalists denied the allegations and appealed against vote-buying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0420;25	Government-controlled TV ran advertisements showing vote-buyers in handcuffs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;0	Akashi went to Pale for talks with the Bosnian Serb leadership after meetings with Bosnian government leaders in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;1	Shortly before he arrived at the presidency , where the federal government has its offices , Bosnian Serb gunners ringing the capital fired two anti-tank missiles at the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;2	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic moments after he left for the Akashi meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;3	Lazovic is an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;4	A short while later , three more missiles hit nearby buildings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;5	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;6	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and blasted the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , even as fighting continued in that northwest region Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;7	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;8	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , referring to European capitulation to Adolf Hitler before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;9	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic that presumably focused on a proposed new peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;10	Redman , now ambassador to Germany , helped draft the first Contact Group peace plan , which the Serbs have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;11	Although that proposal was presented to the Serbs as a take-it-or-leave-it plan , the lack of Western will to use force has allowed the Serbs to demand , apparently successfully , the right of future confederal links with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;12	The original plan denied Serbs that as punishment for starting the war , though it granted the Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation similar rights to link with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;13	Earlier , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss with Karadzic the continued fighting around Bihac , where the United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;14	There was no immediate indication of any progress on that front .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;15	A number of detonations were reported on the edge of the Bihac `` safe area '' Friday , along with machine-gun and small arms fire , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;16	But the heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;17	The Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave , part of which is a U.N. `` safe area , '' in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;18	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;19	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces against the Serbs , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;20	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;21	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia also had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0421;22	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;1	Yasushi Akashi , speaking at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , told reporters he had won assurances that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;2	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;3	Serbs had detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia for more than a week as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;4	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;5	The U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia also said the Serbs had promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;6	Akashi said he was pleased with the `` willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;7	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;8	Earlier Friday , they once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency building minutes before Akashi arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;9	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic promised his side would normalize relations with the United Nations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;10	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;11	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;12	It was not immediately clear whether Karadzic 's comments hinted at potential stumbling blocks to carrying out the promises announced by Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0422;13	`` More or less , we can say we are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0423;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0424;0	Sweden 's new government wants to retake a central role alongside Norway in the Mideast peace process after a three-year hiatus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;1	The government 's initiative features an unusual trip to Israel this weekend by a former foreign minister to devise an economic assistance plan for Palestinian territories .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;2	The plan will detail immediate improvements in conditions for Gaza and the West Bank , the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;3	Sweden hopes the effort , undertaken at the request of Israel and the PLO , will include `` political '' issues , said the official , Sten Andersson , who was involved in talks leading to the 1991 Madrid peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;4	`` It 's high time for Sweden to do something , '' Andersson told The Associated Press before leaving Sweden Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;5	`` The peace process is in a very critical stage right now .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;6	There must be some signs for the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- population that something will happen . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;7	Administration and economic development in Gaza are priorities for PLO leader Yasser Arafat , who is facing pressure from Islamic radicals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;8	Israeli officials have hinted they want to speed up the process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;9	In Brussels this week , foreign donors released dlrs 125 million pledged earlier for the Palestinians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;10	Among the plans under consideration are job-creation programs and the establishment of an industrial zone along Gaza 's borders to attract investment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;11	Andersson , 71 , declined to detail his initiative , other than saying he had new ideas which could be included in the plan to be discussed in Stockholm Dec. 12 by Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;12	Sweden 's neighbor , Norway , already has been deeply involved in the peace process since the country established its acclaimed `` Oslo Channel '' two years ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;13	That channel led to last year 's peace treaty signed in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;14	In what may be mainly a footnote to history , Sweden 's new initiative arises from a domestic political feud and a friendly rivalry with Norway for the mantle of peacemaker in the Middle East .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;15	Swedish officials , led by Andersson , had been intimately involved in Israeli-Palestinian contacts until 1991 , when the Social Democrats lost elections to a center-conservative coalition led by former Prime Minister Carl Bildt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;16	According to Andersson and other officials , the Social Democrats at the time had close contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization , and Arafat was looking for a third country to foster contacts with Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;17	`` The -LRB- conservative -RRB- Bildt government was very passive , that was a pity , '' said Andersson , a career Social Democrat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;18	`` So then I recommended to the PLO that they go to the Norwegians . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;19	Norway 's government was led by Social Democrats also .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;20	Palestinians then turned to Norwegian diplomats to set up talks which eventually led to the `` Oslo Channel , '' a Scandinavian diplomat involved with the talks said on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;21	The diplomat , however , said the relationship had been established well before the change of power in Sweden .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;22	Andersson , now retired , insisted the new Social Democratic government , which returned to power last September , was not trying to take over Norway 's role in the peace process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;23	`` The Norwegians have done a magnificent job and I 'm not here to compete with them , '' Andersson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0424;24	Bildt 's spokeswoman referred all questions about the period to Bildt or his former aides , none of whom could be reached for comment Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;0	An unemployed maid and mother of seven burned a winning dlrs 60,000 lottery ticket because her minister said she would go to hell if she took the devil 's money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;1	Maria Benoiza Nascimento , 39 , said she was `` confused '' by the warning from her minister at an Assembly of God church in Fortaleza , 1,200 miles -LRB- 1,900 kilometers -RRB- northeast of Brasilia , the Correio Braziliense newspaper reported Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;2	The minister , identified only as Preacher Wagner , reportedly said her plane would crash and Mrs. Nascimento would `` sink in sin in hell '' if she tried to receive the prize of 50,000 reals , worth about dlrs 60,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;3	`` Destroy the ticket -- the devil 's work -- to save yourself from the hellfire , '' the minister was quoted as saying , as the congregation chanted `` Burn , burn , burn . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;4	Mrs. Nascimento went home to her one-room shack and burned the ticket , whose winning number was announced Nov. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;5	Then , for good measure , she burned her identification card and her children 's birth certificates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;6	Her husband , also unemployed , beat her and left home when he found out , the newspaper reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;7	It said three of the Nascimentos ' children have pneumonia , another has a heart ailment and the family survives on handouts from neighbors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0425;8	A contrite Mrs. Nascimento said she would ask the SBT television network , which ran the lottery , to validate the prize anyway .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;0	An express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday and slammed into a station building , killing at least 20 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;1	Between 20 and 40 people were believed injured , according to ambulance crews taking victims to hospitals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;2	The accident occurred at Szajol , about 40 miles southeast of the Hungarian capital , when the second car of an express train derailed and dragged three other cars off the tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;3	The overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;4	`` There was a tremedous explosion , like the end of the world , '' a railway employee who witnessed the accident said in a telephone interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;5	People were still buried in the wreckage more than four hours after the crash , said the employee , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;6	National Police Maj. Imre Olah said 20 deaths had been confirmed `` but that 's not the final count by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;7	Doctors at a hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said they admitted 26 injured people to their hospital alone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;8	Several other hospitals also took in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0426;9	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 100 miles east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;0	Rwanda 's prime minister warned Friday that a proposed U.N. force to restore security in refugee camps will fail unless militiamen in the camps are convinced they can not overthrow the new government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;1	Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu also appealed for international aid to help his government stabilize the chaos in Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;2	U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali last week recommended sending as many as 5,000 peacekeepers to the camps in neighboring Zaire , which shelter hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;3	The Security Council has not yet acted on the proposal and Twagiramungu 's warning is likely to make the council more cautious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;4	Militiamen and soldiers who fled Rwanda with an estimated 1.2 million refugees are in effect controlling camps and there is evidence that they are planning an invasion of Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;5	`` You must convince soldiers there that their aim of coming to Rwanda by violence is no longer possible , '' Twagiramungu said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;6	`` They can not win the war they want to win . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;7	He said the United Nations must also help persuade refugees that they can safely return to Rwanda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;8	`` Otherwise if you go into the camps ... I am afraid that certain conflict is going to break -LRB- out -RRB- and it can take us too far . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;9	Twagiramungu said the Rwandan army could stop any attempted invasion by soldiers of the former government `` unless there is ... outside assistance . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;10	But he said there were fears that the militiamen could carry out a protracted guerrilla war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;11	In an appeal to the refugees , Twagiramungu said that `` those who want to rebuild their nation , they must come back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;12	Rwanda has warned that it will prosecute militiamen responsible for massacres .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;13	Twagiramungu , however , said he believed that `` 90 percent '' of the refugees were innocent of genocide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;14	The Tutsi-led rebels , the Rwandan Patriotic Front , defeated the Hutu government after the death of Rwanda 's president in a plane crash sparked a massacre , mostly of minority Tutsis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0427;15	Between April and June , an estimated 500,000 people were killed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;0	CourmAosta of Italy beat Austria 's Villach 3-1 on Friday in a semifinal of the `` Six Nations '' ice hockey tournament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;1	Gerald Ressmann of Villach opened the scoring at 19:29 of the first period .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;2	Bob Reynolds tied it for CourmAosta at 10:41 of the second .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;3	Sim Camazzola scored the eventual winner at 11:18 of the third .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;4	Alberto Scapinello added an insurance goal at 11:43 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;5	Teams from Austria , Italy , Slovenia , France , Holland and Denmark are playing in the tournament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0428;6	Dave Gagner of the National Hockey League 's Dallas Stars played for CourmAosta .

APW_ENG_19941202.0429;0	The U.S. Postal Service on Friday defended its stamp recalling the atomic bombing of Japan saying that it could not omit such a major event from its World War II history series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;1	The stamp , showing a mushroom-shaped cloud rising from an atomic blast , is one of a set of 10 stamps marking major events of 1945 to be sold on a sheet titled `` 1945 : Victory at Last . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;2	Forty stamps have already been issued in similar sets for the 50th anniversary of the 1941-44 war years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;3	But the atomic bomb stamp is drawing sharp criticism in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;4	Sunao Tsuboi , acting director of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-bomb Survivors Organizations , termed it `` outrageous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;5	Japan surrendered Aug. 15 , 1945 , days after atomic bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;6	`` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 , '' says the caption on the mushroom cloud stamp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;7	Postal Service spokesman Robin Wright said the World War II series was developed in cooperation with the State and Defense departments to assure historical accuracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;8	As far as the atomic bomb stamp , he said , `` we would be remiss in omitting such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic bomb . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;9	`` Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of events of World War II , and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events , '' Wright added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;10	Other stamps in the 1945 set picture U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima , `` Okinawa , the last big battle , '' liberations of Manila and of Holocaust survivors in Europe , Germany 's surrender at Reims , refugees uprooted by war and U.S. celebrations of Japanese surrender .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;11	The 1941 set , titled `` A World at War '' included stamps showing Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill framing the Atlantic Charter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0429;12	The 1944 set , titled `` Road to Victory '' included the allied Normandy landings , the liberation of Rome and the battles of Leyte Gulf in the Pacific and the Bulge in Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;0	Growers , sellers and users of marijuana gathered here Friday at an event that was part drug festival , part trade fair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;1	The second annual Netherweed Festival drew about 2,000 enthusiastic visitors with a mixture of events ranging from a contest to decide the nation 's best Dutch-grown weed to a fashion show and pop music .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;2	But for many it was a chance to meet business contacts and do deals in the growers ' room , although selling the product was not allowed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;3	Giving it away , maybe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;4	Netherweed has become the generic term for high-power marijuana developed and grown in the Netherlands , a nation known for its high-tech agricultural techniques .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;5	`` There are about 20 paying stalls here and a couple of non-commercial stands , '' said Henk van Velthooven , spokesman for the organizer , the Dutch marijuana magazine `` High Life . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;6	He spoke proudly of how the commercial stalls were helping out by sponsoring the event at the Marcanti Plaza , while non-commercials like the Dutch Cannabis Consumers ' Union was there for free , trying to recruit new members .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;7	If anyone could see the stall through the dense smoke .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;8	`` Before we took over , there were a lot of local harvest festivals , but we 've taken this to a national level , '' said Van Velthooven .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;9	One man at the festival for business rather than pleasure was John Campion , 34 , of Hartlepool in northeast England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;10	`` I 've been running a shop selling growing kits for five months and in that time I 've had a turnover of about 150,000 pounds -LRB- dlrs 230,000 -RRB- , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;11	`` I do like a smoke , but this is business .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;12	I regard it solely as business . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;13	Campion said he exploits a loophole in British law that allows him to sell equipment for growing marijuana , but does not allow people to use the equipment after they 've bought it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;14	`` We do n't ask people what they are going to do with it , '' said Campion with a wink .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;15	In the Netherlands , the sale and possession of both hard and soft drugs in small quantities are non-prosecutable offenses , although technically still illegal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;16	Police prefer to concentrate on arresting large-scale traffickers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;17	Ed Rosenthal , a self-proclaimed `` marijuana expert '' from Oakland , Calif. , was invited to the festival to give a speech on growing techniques .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;18	When he arrived , there was no microphone and no projector for his slides , but he did n't seem to mind .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;19	`` Get me a chair to stand on and a joint , pure marijuana with hashish and we 'll be alright , '' he told the organizers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;20	`` If they had an event like this in America , the police would be in here arresting everybody , '' added Rosenthal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;21	Another aspect of the festival was a competition for the best marijuana grown in the Netherlands .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;22	A jury of experts was hoping to give its verdict after weeks of testing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0430;23	`` If there 's anyone still standing , '' said Van Velthooven .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;0	Russian lawmakers negotiating the release of prisoners in Chechnya accused their own government Friday of sending the jets that have attacked the breakaway republic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;1	Four Russian parliament members , allies of President Boris Yeltsin , are trying to get Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev to release about 70 Russians , including Army soldiers , who were captured in fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;2	Dudayev , who declared independence for his Caucasus Mountain republic in 1991 , says Moscow is arming and leading the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;3	Yeltsin 's government has denied providing anything but political support , even as jets have attacked and Russian soldiers have been captured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;4	Jets roared over Grozny , the Chechen capital , for a fourth day Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;5	Raids this week have killed at least four civilians and an airport guard , and destroyed planes at civilian and military airports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;6	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French , but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , a parliament member a member of the delegation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;7	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;8	`` You can rest assured that President Yeltsin has recognized the prisoners as members of the Russian Army , '' delegation leader Sergei Yushenkov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;9	Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has called the captives mercenaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;10	A dozen prisoners , interviewed by The Associated Press while Chechen guards watched , said they were promised money by Russia 's Federal Counterintelligence Service for fighting with the Chechen rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;11	But they said the operations went badly , and that some of their Chechen allies did not know how to use guns and fled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;12	Counterintelligence spokesman Alexander Mikhailov , asked about such reports at a news conference Friday , said only that Chechnya is part of Russia and that the servicemen should be called volunteers , not mercenaries , ITAR-Tass and Interfax said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;13	Dudayev first threatened to kill the prisoners if Russia did not claim them , but later said they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;14	Yeltsin had threatened to send troops if they were not released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;15	Moscow has toned down the threat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;16	But it continued to beef up troops on Chechnya 's borders , news reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;17	Since the air offensive began last week , thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;18	Russia conquered the mainly Muslim Chechens in its imperial drive toward the Black Sea last century .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;19	Suppressed ethnic tensions have boiled over since the 1991 Soviet collapse .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;20	Many Russian nationalists vow never to let Chechnya go .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;21	The opposition accuses Dudayev of running Chechnya 's economy into the ground .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;22	The main industry , oil refining , is operating at 10 percent of capacity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;23	But Chechen pride and age-old enmity with Russia have rallied many people to Dudayev 's side , including volunteers from other Caucasus regions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;24	At a pro-Dudayev camp outside Grozny , 24-year-old Sergei Chicherov , a blue-eyed Cossack , had cast his lot with the Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0431;25	`` If someone comes and attacks your home , are you supposed to just sit and watch ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;0	It was as if someone had turned the already wretched slum into a gas chamber , unleashing a toxic brew that doomed thousands of people in a matter of hours by making them gulp the air that killed them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;1	Tens of thousands of people crawled or ran , panic-stricken , from their homes that miserable night in Bhopal 10 years ago , victims of a lethal gas leak from a subsidiary of U.S.-based Union Carbide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;2	Hazara Bee was one of the survivors of the world 's worst industrial disaster .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;3	`` Everyone was fleeing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;4	I ran and ran and fainted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;5	When I regained consciousness , I remember someone asking me if my husband 's name was Abdul Latif , '' Mrs. Bee , 50 , said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;6	A hospital staffer was trying to identify her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;7	Her husband , Abdul Latif , was already dead -- one of 4,000 who died that night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;8	By official count , about 3,000 others died later from illnesses caused by the disaster at the pesticide plant .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;9	That night , hundreds of corpses lay where they fell , their mouths and eyes covered with a white froth formed by the reaction of the poison gas with the oxygen the victims had tried so desperately to breathe in their last minutes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;10	Most had their mouths open in a last gasp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;11	Street dogs gnawed at the corpses that lay all over the slum , which adjoined the Union Carbide factory that had employed thousands in Bhopal , then killed them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;12	On Friday , police arrested 11,000 people on their way to Bhopal to mark the anniversary with a rally demanding compensation , organizers said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;13	Officials could not confirm the number of arrests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;14	Police arrested the demonstrators on trains at stations outside Bhopal and charged them with traveling without tickets -- a common violation that is rarely enforced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;15	A decade after the tragedy , the visible scars have all but faded from Bhopal , an 11th-century city built around two lakes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;16	A parking lot was built on land outside Hamidia Hospital where , 10 years ago , hundreds of bodies were laid out , cardboard name cards placed at each head .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;17	The potholed roads leading to the Union Carbide pesticide factory , where victims lay struggling for breath or blinded , have been repaved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;18	Once , the plant 's tall smokestacks symbolized opportunity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;19	Today , the smokestacks are rusty and the metal tank that leaked the deadly methyl isocyanate just before midnight on Dec. 2 , 1984 , is smothered with weeds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;20	Union Carbide , whose parent company is based in Danbury , Conn. , sold off the last of its Indian holdings this summer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;21	But though the physical reminders have been erased , pain and poverty still stalk many of the half million survivors in Bhopal , a city of 500,000 in central India .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;22	Many do n't like to talk any more about the tragedy that ruined their lives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;23	For the past 10 years , they have discussed their agony with so many doctors , lawyers , officials and reporters that the exercise of recollection has become an exercise in futility .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;24	The last hope for any redress -- monetary compensation -- is snarled in a tangle of red tape .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;25	As dawn breaks on any given day , men , women and children line up outside the claims court to complete paperwork for receiving compensation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;26	The effects of gas poisoning are still claiming victims , like Savitri Singh .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;27	`` She had been sick off and on since 1984 , often complaining of chest pain and breathlessness , '' said her husband , Daulat Singh , as he prepared the funeral pyre Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;28	`` The doctors said she was sick because of the gas , but she died before getting any compensation and proper medical care . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;29	`` These poor and uneducated people ca n't prove that the death occurred due to long-term aftereffects of the gas , '' said Abdul Jabbar Khan , head of the Bhopal Gas Victims Organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;30	`` Our estimate is that 25,000 people have died until now directly or indirectly due to the gas leak . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;31	In 1989 , Union Carbide paid dlrs 470 million -- one-twelfth of India 's original claim -- in an out-of-court settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0434;32	About 94,000 compensation claims have been settled and dlrs 20 million paid to victims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;0	Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard had his left leg amputated after being attacked by a strain of flesh-eating bacteria , but is out of danger , doctors said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;1	Bouchard , 55 , the most popular leader in Canada 's largest French-speaking province , vowed to continue his political career , dedicated to making Quebec an independent country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;2	`` Mr. Bouchard has greatly improved over the past 12 hours , '' Dr. Patrick d'Amico told a news conference at Montreal 's St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;3	D'Amico said Bouchard had undergone three operations since being admitted to the hospital earlier this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;4	The left leg was amputated at mid-thigh in an operation during which he was conscious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;5	If no further complications occur , Bouchard should recover fully in about three or four months , said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;6	Earlier Friday , rumors circulated that Bouchard was on the verge of death , but hospital officials dismissed them as untrue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;7	News of Bouchard 's illness shook Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;8	Small groups of people , some bearing Quebec flags , kept an all-night vigil outside the hospital under a light snowfall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;9	Bouchard was struck by a rare disease known as necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as the `` flesh-eating disease . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;10	Doctors say the disease is caused by the streptococcus A bacteria and is fatal in 80 percent of the cases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;11	The bacteria is common and usually results in sore throats or tonsilitis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;12	But in about one in a million cases , it turns deadly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;13	Bouchard , a former Conservative Cabinet minister , bolted former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 's government in 1990 and formed his own party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;14	The new party became , effectively , the national arm of the Parti Quebecois , the provincial party dedicated to the secession of Quebec and its 7 million inhabitants from Canada .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;15	In the 1993 federal elections , the Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats to become the official opposition to the ruling Liberals in the House of Commons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;16	Few wanted to speculate on what the absence of Bouchard would have on the political scene or the referendum on independence expected next year in Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;17	Politicians of all political stripes expressed their concern for Bouchard 's health and wished him well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;18	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , on a trip to France , said : `` I speak not only for the government of Canada , but also for the people of Canada when I express to Mr. Bouchard and his family our deep regrets and our sincere wish for a rapid return of his health . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;19	The disease struck Bouchard suddenly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;20	Last weekend he had attended a party congress , though he complained of having the flu .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;21	On Tuesday , he was diagnose with phlebitis , an inflammation of a vein in his leg , and was admitted to St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;22	Dr. Pierre Ghosn , head of cardiovascular surgery , said he operated to relieve pressure in the leg and discovered the disease .
APW_ENG_19941202.0435;23	A third operation was necessary to remove infection found in the abdomen and
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;0	Akashi went to Pale for talks with the Bosnian Serb leadership after meetings with Bosnia 's Muslim-led government in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;1	Shortly before he arrived at the presidency , where the Bosnian government has its offices , Bosnian Serb gunners ringing the capital fired two anti-tank missiles at the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;2	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic moments after he left for the Akashi meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;3	Lazovic is an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;4	A short while later , three more missiles hit nearby buildings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;5	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;6	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and blasted the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , as fighting continued in that northwest region Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;7	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;8	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;9	He was referring to European appeasement of Adolf Hitler at a 1938 meeting in Munich before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;10	Charles Redman , a U.S. diplomat , was also back in Sarajevo , leading talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic that presumably focused on a proposed new peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;11	Redman , now U.S. ambassador to Germany , helped draft the first international peace plan drawn up by the five-nation Contact Group , which the Serbs have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;12	Although that proposal was presented to the Serbs as a take-it-or-leave-it plan , the lack of Western will to use force has allowed the Serbs to demand , apparently successfully , the right of future confederal links with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;13	The original plan denied Serbs that as punishment for starting the war , though it granted the Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation similar rights to link with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;14	Akashi hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;15	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed in even trying to meet the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides might force the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;16	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , Friday after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;17	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , along with hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;18	In New York , Russia and Ukraine issued a statement Friday calling on U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the U.N. command to take `` all appropriate measures ... to facilitate the release of all captured or detained '' U.N. personnel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;19	Earlier in Bosnia , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss with Karadzic the continued fighting around Bihac , where the United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;20	There was no immediate indication of any progress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;21	A number of detonations were reported on the edge of the Bihac `` safe area '' Friday , along with machine-gun and small arms fire , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;22	But the heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;23	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave , part of which is a U.N.-designated `` safe area , '' in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;24	There were also signs that the frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;25	Bosnian Croats , who are allied with the Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;26	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;27	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia also had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0436;28	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;0	Most of the 608 passengers aboard the Cebu City were sleeping when a freighter slammed into the ferry Friday in Manila Bay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;1	The ferry sank a half hour later , a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;2	At least 34 people drowned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;3	Divers discovered more bodies in the ship , lying under 30 meters -LRB- 100 feet -RRB- of water , but could not get to them before the search for the more than 100 people still missing was called off for the night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;4	`` Suddenly we heard a crash , '' Erwin Maravilla said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;5	`` I grabbed my two children , but when the ferry sank we were sucked under the water with it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;6	A piece of metal hit my arm , and I lost hold of my two kids . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;7	His wife also was among the missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;8	Ships in the area plucked 451 people from the sea , many coated with the diesel oil disgorged as the ferry sank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;9	The freighter , the Singapore-registered Kota Suria , joined in the rescue effort , its bow badly bent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;10	Survivors complained the crew did little to save people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;11	The radio room may have been severely damaged because the distress signals came from other ships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;12	Maximo Calamba , who was rescued with his wife and 1-year-old son , said he heard many cries for help .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;13	`` There was no alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;14	We were thrown off our cots and everybody was on their own . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;15	The collision occurred before dawn near the town of Rosario , about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;16	The freighter , five times the ferry 's size , destroyed the bridge and tore a gaping hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;17	The captain and his mates were in the bridge , the control section of the ferry , said one crewman , Jacob Cabatuan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;18	They were among the missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;19	The cause of the accident , which occurred in calm seas under clear night skies , is under investigation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;20	The company that owns the ferry said it was rammed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;21	Danny Dalugdog , a driver and bodyguard , was separated from his wife and 3-month-old son in the confusion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;22	`` I thought they were gone . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;23	But he found his wife on the freighter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;24	Then , as they transferred to a coast guard ship to return to Manila , a passenger called out that he found a baby boy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;25	`` It turned out to be my son , '' Dalugdog said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;26	A coast guard spokesman , Lt. Cmdr. Amado Samante , said 451 passengers had been rescued and 34 bodies recovered , many children and women .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;27	`` There were more bodies inside the cabins , '' said Angel Espidido , a coast guard diver .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;28	Divers could see the dead through the portholes but were unable to open the doors late Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;29	`` Tomorrow we will go back to unlock them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;30	Cargo containers and rubber rafts floated in the sea , but many survivors apparently never got a chance to use them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;31	`` I was jolted by the crash and I woke up , '' said Melissa Selosia , who was on her way to going to Mindanao Island , 780 kilometers -LRB- 485 miles -RRB- south of Manila for Christmas with her four children .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;32	`` I grabbed a life jacket and made for the upper deck and then I jumped into the water . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;33	She said she swam as quickly as possible from the sinking ferry , recalling her seaman husband 's words that a sinking boat will suck down everything around it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;34	The ferry 's owner , the William Lines shipping company , said 608 people were on board .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;35	The accident coincided with the company 's initial public stock offering Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;36	The ferry , which can carry 800 people , was en route to Tagbilaran , capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- southeast of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0438;37	The worst peacetime ferry disaster occurred in the Philippines in December 1987 when 4,341 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;0	Church of England leaders on Friday decided to examine their policy against church remarriage of divorced people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;1	Some vicars now bend the existing guidelines and allow new marriages , others follow the letter of the law and refuse to marry divorcees , while still others seek permission from their bishops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;2	The state church 's ruling General Synod on Friday told members of the House of Bishops to examine the issue and report back .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;3	The church 's second-highest ranking prelate appeared to throw his weight behind change .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;4	Archbishop of York John Habgood said the time had come to clear up the confusion and find common agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;5	But said he believed the situation had changed in recent years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;6	Divorced people could now become priests -- a move that was `` not nearly so difficult as was first feared . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;7	He told the Synod 's 560 members at their London meeting : `` I hope we can reflect on that and how that is viewed in our own dioceses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0439;8	We may find grounds for bringing a more coordinated policy back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;0	In a bizarre raid lasting several hours Friday night , heavily armed police in ski masks blocked off a downtown building that houses city government and the offices of one of Russia 's top bankers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;1	It was not clear who conducted the raid or whether it actually had anything to do with banker Vladimir Gusinsky or his prominent Most Group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;2	But six of the bank 's employees were detained , and company cars and employees were searched as they tried to leave .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;3	Gusinsky called it the latest case of harassment against Russia 's entrepreneurs , and drafted a letter to President Boris Yeltsin demanding an investigation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;4	The banker said the armed men blocked off his offices without explanation at about 5 p.m.
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;5	They left about five hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;6	The Interior Ministry eventually told him the gunmen were part of a task force against organized crime , Gusinsky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;7	The Interfax news agency cited non-official sources saying the action was in response to shots fired near the building , which is across the street from the White House , the Russian government 's headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;8	Two Most Group drivers and four guards were detained , regional prosecutor Alexander Silykhovkin said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;9	He gave no other details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;10	The Most Group has more than 10 different companies , including a bank , newspaper and TV network .
APW_ENG_19941202.0440;11	The Association of Russian Banks issued a protest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;0	In a bizarre raid lasting several hours Friday night , heavily armed police in ski masks blocked off a downtown building that houses city government and the offices of one of Russia 's top bankers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;1	It was not clear who conducted the raid or whether it actually had anything to do with banker Vladimir Gusinsky or his prominent Most Group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;2	But six of the bank 's employees were detained , and company cars and employees were searched as they tried to leave .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;3	Gusinsky called it the latest case of harassment against Russia 's entrepreneurs , and drafted a letter to President Boris Yeltsin demanding an investigation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;4	The banker said the armed men blocked off his offices without explanation at about 5 p.m.
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;5	They left about five hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;6	The Interior Ministry eventually told him the gunmen were part of a task force against organized crime , Gusinsky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;7	The Interfax news agency cited non-official sources saying the action was in response to shots fired near the building , which is across the street from the White House , the Russian government 's headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;8	Two Most Group drivers and four guards were detained , regional prosecutor Alexander Silykhovkin said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;9	He gave no other details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0441;10	The Most Group has more than 10 different companies , including a bank , newspaper and TV network .

APW_ENG_19941202.0442;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;2	NATO Secretary General Willy Claes said he knew of no request from the U.N. to halt or scale-down enforcement of the military flight ban which is designed to protect civilians from bombardment in the 31-month war .

APW_ENG_19941202.0442;5	Christopher told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;6	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them `` and we continue to police the no-fly zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;7	However , a senior U.S. military officer acknowledged in Washington that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to NATO aircraft , although he declined to indicate exactly what they were .
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;8	`` The mission ... continues unabated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;9	It 's not degraded , '' said the senior officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;10	`` We 're doing some work to carry out the mission , but we are flying in as smart a way as we can . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;11	The officer noted that the Serb surface-to-air missile sites present a `` very serious ... threat that 's of great concern to us . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;12	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York also denied reports that the United Nations had formally requested a suspension of the no-fly zone
APW_ENG_19941202.0442;13	`` There is no intention of requesting such a suspension , '' he said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0445;3	The consequences of suddenly pulling UN peacekeepers out of the former Yugoslavia are things that give military planners nightmares .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;4	`` Getting out of there is going to take casualties , there 's no way around it , '' said Jim Dunnigan , a New York-based author and military analyst .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;5	Some politicans say the UN should just withdraw , but it 's easier said than done .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;6	Winter weather , bad roads , potential opposition and the mobs of refugees that might tag along on a retreat could create disaster .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;7	Officials at the UN estimate it would take five months to pull the 23,000 peacekeepers from 20 nations out of Bosnia-Herzegovina under ideal conditions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;8	In the face of opposition , retreat could mean death and destruction .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;9	Gen. John de Chastelain , Canada 's top soldier , says evacuation plans exist , but adds that all contingencies have to be taken into account and that there 's no intention of pulling out Canada 's 2,000 soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;10	He admits a sudden , opposed withdrawal would be difficult .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;11	It likely would be opposed right now .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;12	To the Muslims , the UN is a protector and provider of food , fuel and medicine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;13	Bosnian Serbs see peacekeepers as a handy shield against air attacks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;14	`` The UN 's scattered all over hell 's half acre in penny packets , '' said Martin Shadwick of York University .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;15	`` It 's not as if they 're all in one or two super bases where you could collect them from .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;16	Getting them to collection points would be tricky . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;17	They 'd likely have to destroy tonnes of supplies and equipment to keep them from one side or another .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;18	Would the factions stand idly by and watch food , medicine , ammunition and vehicles burned or ruined ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;19	Once the peacekeepers assembled , how would they escape ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;20	Helicopters and transport planes are big , noisy and slow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;21	`` They make beautiful targets , '' said Dunnigan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;22	Lew MacKenzie , the retired peacekeeping general , said allied air power might try to clear a corridor 20 kilometres wide on either side of the evacuation route to hold off artillery attacks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;23	`` The aircraft will try to maintain combat air patrol over you the entire way to the border and even then -LRB- attackers -RRB- will be able to slip through .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;24	One anti-tank weapon knocking out the leading vehicle will do the job . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;25	Sean Henry , a retired artillery colonel , said a hostile withdrawal in winter conditions `` would quickly degenerate into a very serious situation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;26	`` They would either have to fight their way out and absorb casualties or somehow or other have a force of Americans , Britons and French come ashore and establish a defended corridor or a series of defended corridors and routes . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;27	That would mean extensive clashes in mountainous terrain under winter skies that make flying iffy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;28	Henry 's advice : Do n't leave unless it 's the only choice .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;29	What if thousands of refugees clog the roads ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;30	`` We 're just not the kind of people that drive over kids that are sitting in front of the tracks , '' said MacKenzie .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;31	Dunnigan offers a novel approach : bribe your way out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;32	He admits that `` people back here , safe and sound by their hearth , will say , What ! ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;33	But it could work and save lives , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;34	`` Buy off the local gunsels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0445;35	That 's the sort of thing these guys will listen to . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;0	Bosnian Serb leaders were reported Friday to have promised to release hundreds of detained UN peacekeepers , but Canadian officials in Paris could not confirm the report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;1	There was also no sign of any change in the status of the 55 Canadian peacekeepers facing a second weekend being detained by Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;2	Reuters news agency and the Associated Press quoted UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi as saying Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;3	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi was quoted as saying after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;4	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;5	The Serbs have been holding about 400 UN soldiers as insurance against NATO airstrikes on their siege of the Muslim pocket of Bihac , a UN-declared safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;6	In Paris , senior Canadian officials said the situation was still evolving and they could not confirm any dead had been reached .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;7	`` When the hostages are free , that will be a confirmation , '' one senior official said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;8	The officials are in Paris with Prime Minister Jean Chretien .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;9	A UN spokesman in Zagreb , Croatia said he had heard the news reports about such an agreement `` but we 're not officially confirming that at the moment . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;10	Reuters reported the Serbs apparently rejected a new ceasefire proposal drafted by the United Nations which the Bosnian government accepted hours ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;11	Yet the Serbs also released 70 Dutch peacekeepers taken hostage Saturday near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;12	The soldiers were in good condition , Dutch officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;13	The 55 Canadians have been held for the past 10 days at various sites in Serb-held territory near their peacekeeping camp in Visoko , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;14	About 20 are at a police complex in the village of Illijas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;15	The rest are at checkpoints and observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;16	The soldiers are in radio contact with their camp and those at observation posts carry on their work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;17	Maj. Dean Milner , the senior officer among the detainees , is able to drive around in his vehicle and visit his soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;18	The Serbs are allowing supply vehicles from camp to reach the soldiers with mail , food and other items .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;19	Akashi , the top UN civilian leader in Bosnia set out Friday to hold talks with the Bosnian government in Sarajevo and with Serb leader Karadzic in Pale .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;20	His mission started badly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0446;21	Three missiles hit the Bosnian government building shortly before he arrived .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;0	Growers , sellers and users of marijuana gathered here Friday at an event that was part drug festival , part trade fair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;1	The second annual Netherweed Festival drew about 2,000 enthusiastic visitors with a mixture of events ranging from a contest to decide the nation 's best Dutch-grown weed to a fashion show and pop music .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;2	But for many it was a chance to meet business contacts and do deals in the growers ' room , although selling the product was not allowed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;3	Giving it away , maybe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;4	Netherweed has become the generic term for high-power marijuana developed and grown in the Netherlands , a nation known for its high-tech agricultural techniques .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;5	`` There are about 20 paying stalls here and a couple of non-commercial stands , '' said Henk van Velthooven , spokesman for the organizer , the Dutch marijuana magazine `` High Life . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;6	He spoke proudly of how the commercial stalls were helping out by sponsoring the event at the Marcanti Plaza , while non-commercials like the Dutch Cannabis Consumers ' Union was there for free , trying to recruit new members .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;7	If anyone could see the stall through the dense smoke .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;8	`` Before we took over , there were a lot of local harvest festivals , but we 've taken this to a national level , '' said Van Velthooven .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;9	One man at the festival for business rather than pleasure was John Campion , 34 , of Hartlepool in northeast England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;10	`` I 've been running a shop selling growing kits for five months and in that time I 've had a turnover of about 150,000 pounds -LRB- dlrs 230,000 -RRB- , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;11	`` I do like a smoke , but this is business .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;12	I regard it solely as business . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;13	Campion said he exploits a loophole in British law that allows him to sell equipment for growing marijuana , but does not allow people to use the equipment after they 've bought it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;14	`` We do n't ask people what they are going to do with it , '' said Campion with a wink .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;15	In the Netherlands , the sale and possession of both hard and soft drugs in small quantities are non-prosecutable offenses , although technically still illegal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;16	Police prefer to concentrate on arresting large-scale traffickers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;17	Ed Rosenthal , a self-proclaimed `` marijuana expert '' from Oakland , Calif. , was invited to the festival to give a speech on growing techniques .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;18	When he arrived , there was no microphone and no projector for his slides , but he did n't seem to mind .
APW_ENG_19941202.0447;19	`` Get me a chair to stand on and a joint , pure marijuana with hashish and we 'll be alright , '' he told the organizers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;0	It has been 30-odd years since Gregory Condolucci , an elevator operator , laid eyes on Milton Petrie .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;1	It turns out that neither man forgot .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;2	Petrie left the 85-year-old Condolucci dlrs 9,999.96 a year for life .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;3	Petrie , known in life -- and now , in death -- for his generosity , remembered hundreds of people , a few famous , most unknown , in his dlrs 800 million will .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;4	`` He got a big kick out of me , '' recalls Condolucci , who operated the elevator at a New York City tennis club frequented by Petrie decades ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;5	`` I always kidded him . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;6	Petrie , 92 , the down-to-earth son of a Russian immigrant pawnshop owner , died on Nov. 6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;7	He built his fortune with a chain of women 's clothing stores .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;8	Petrie 's will names 451 beneficiaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;9	They include strangers he 'd been helping since he read about them in the newspapers , and loyal employees whom he 'd promised a more comfortable retirement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;10	He also provided generously for his own family members and for a few celebrities such as former Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek , writer Elie Wiesel and Marla Hanson , the model whose face was slashed on the street .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;11	The value of his estate fluctuates with the stock market .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;12	One of his lawyers , Jerome A. Manning , believes it 's around dlrs 800 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;13	`` He said he never forgot where he came from , '' said Cordelia Fuller , whose son , policeman Robert Venable , was killed five years ago by a car thief .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;14	A dozen times , Petrie asked Mrs. Fuller to bring Venable 's daughter , Januari , now 15 , to his office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;15	`` He would give her teddy bears and a check , '' Mrs. Fuller recalled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;16	`` He wanted to know about her progress in school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;17	She was very crazy about him . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;18	Under the will , Mrs. Fuller , a nursing supervisor in Brooklyn , will receive dlrs 5,000 a year for life .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;19	`` It 's nice what he did but I 'd rather for him to be here , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;20	Condolucci , a widower , said he 'll use his money to help his brothers , nieces and nephews .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;21	And he 'll replace his couch , which was ruined in a flood .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;22	`` He always took care of me , '' Condolucci said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;23	`` I had polio .
APW_ENG_19941202.0448;24	He paid for my two pairs of shoes .

APW_ENG_19941202.0450;0	Boris Yeltsin was bad luck for Russian tennis on Friday , and Sweden 's Davis Cup team hopes to see him again soon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;1	The Russian president and his entourage interrupted play at a critical moment in the tense fifth set of Stefan Edberg 's match against Alexander Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;2	Edberg , energized by the pause , ended Volkov 's come-from-behind drive and led Sweden to a 2-0 singles sweep , winning 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;3	Magnus Larsson , ranked 19th by the ATP Tour , went on to defeat No. 11-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov in another five set thriller , 6-0 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 2-6 , 6-3 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;4	The losses disappointed the whistling , foot-stomping hometown crowd of 12,000 at Olympic Stadium , and likely doomed Russia 's chances of becoming the first unseeded team to win the Davis Cup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;5	On Saturday , Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy upset the top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned ATP Tour doubles champions Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell to keep their hopes alive and send the best-of-five match to Sunday 's reverse singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;6	Kafelnikov accused Yeltsin of ruining Volkov 's concentration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;7	Unlike other fans , a smiling and waving Yeltsin took his seat without waiting for the brief break when the players change sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;8	`` Do you remember what the score was when the president arrived ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;9	`` It was 5-5 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;10	Is there a switch then ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;11	What sensible person in a decisive game like this , with the score 5-5 , would do something like that in such a tense situation ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;12	Volkov , however , did not blame Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;13	`` I could n't have failed to notice when the president arrived , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;14	`` -LRB- But -RRB- I can say it interfered with my game as much as rain outside would have , because I had lost my serve by then . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;15	Edberg said he did n't realize until later that it was Yeltsin who had caused the delay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;16	But considering the outcome , `` maybe I should thank Boris for coming in , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;17	Larsson said he hopes to see more of Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;18	`` I wish him welcome tomorrow for doubles , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;19	`` But maybe he can come in during the changeover next time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;20	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;21	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;22	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;23	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;24	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;25	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared en route to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;26	But buoyed by the flag-waving , cheering crowd , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;27	Volkov , 27 , then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;28	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;29	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;30	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;31	Friday 's loss was Kafelnikov 's first in eight Davis Cup matches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;32	His only other loss was in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;33	Kafelnikov said he felt `` mental and psychological pressure '' after Volkov 's dramatic defeat , and said he said he injured his left wrist in the second game of the last set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;34	He strained the same wrist last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;35	`` It did n't really hurt but I felt very insecure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0450;36	I could n't hit slices , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;0	The government may suspend its case against General Motors pickup trucks alleged to be fire hazards in crashes , sources close to the case said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;1	For its part , GM would spend up to dlrs 60 million on safety and research programs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;2	Transportation Secretary Federico Pena scheduled a news conference for 3:30 p.m. in Washington concerning the trucks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;3	The sources , who spoke on condition they not be identified , said the idea behind the deal would be that the safety and research program GM would fund has the potential to save more lives than a recall of GM 's 1973-87 C-K pickups .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;4	Pena announced Oct. 17 that he had determined the trucks present an unreasonable risk of fire in side-impact collisions because their fuel tanks are mounted outside the vehicle frame .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;5	He scheduled a public meeting , set for Tuesday in Washington , to gather additional information on whether he should order a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;6	The deal described by the sources would cancel the meeting , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Transportation Department would not proceed with further steps toward a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;7	GM has never wavered in its argument that the trucks are among the safest vehicles on the road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;8	NHTSA began investigating them two years ago after consumer groups petitioned for a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;9	The agency asked GM to voluntarily recall the trucks in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;10	Pena acknowledged in October that the trucks meet federal crash safety standards , but he said the law requires that they be safe in real-world conditions as well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;11	GM filed suit last month seeking to block any further action by him in the case .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;12	About 9 million of the trucks were built between model years 1973 and 1987 and sold under Chevrolet and GMC nameplates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0451;13	GM estimates about 5 million still are in use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official denied Friday that the alliance had abandoned its enforcement of the U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said , amid continued confusion between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over how to deal with the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;2	Earlier Friday , Wing Commander Timothy Hewlet , U.N. director for air operations in Bosnia , told reporters in Sarajevo that Bosnian Serbs had activated several surface-to-air missile sites throughout the country , threatening humanitarian flights and NATO jets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;3	Hewlet said NATO had agreed to a `` cooling off '' period to calm tensions , but was able to `` control '' the situation with AWACs planes flying outside Bosnian air space .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;4	`` There are no flights over Bosnia at the moment that I am aware of , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;5	At NATO headquarters , Secretary-General Willy Claes said he was unaware of any request from the United Nations to halt or scale-down Allied patrols enforcing of the military flight ban , designed to protect Bosnian civilians from bombardment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;6	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;7	However , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in former Yugoslavia , acknowledged talks on the issue were underway .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;8	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;9	`` But I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;10	NATO and the United Nations have repeatedly talked of the need to `` show presence '' in the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;11	But NATO sources in Brussels said Allied planes had been fired on nine times in recent days by Serb missiles and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;12	Under current rules of engagement , NATO planes can strike back if targeted without prior approval from the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;13	Thant Myint-U , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , cautioned that such retaliation could lead to an increase in fighting at a time when international negotiators were trying to revive flagging peace efforts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;14	`` There would be massive escalation in the situation on the ground that could spin out of control , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;15	Christopher told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;16	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them , `` and we continue to police the ` no-fly ' zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;17	In Washington however , a senior U.S. military officer acknowledged that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;18	He would not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;19	On Tuesday , officials said the United Nations requested and NATO agreed that planes would not fly over Bosnia for a 48-hour period while U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other peace negotiators visited Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;20	Western military sources said it appeared that request was extended slightly , and it was not clear if NATO planes were back in Bosnian airspace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;21	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , speaking in Pale after his meeting with Akashi , said , `` We would like to see skies clear of ... NATO aircraft . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0453;22	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents , '' Karadzic added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;0	CHICAGO -LRB- AP -RRB- - Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on signs of brisk export demand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;1	Soybeans reversed a three-day slide after the Agriculture Department reported U.S. soybean exports totaled 60,000 metric tons last week , a robust figure according to Victor Lespinasse , assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter , Discover and Co.
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;2	Soybeans also were bolstered by a sharp increase in Malaysian palm oil futures overseas and higher bids for soybean oil in Rotterdam , the main port of entry for U.S. farm goods into Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;3	Wheat futures rose for the third straight day on expectations for new export sales to Egypt or China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;4	Egypt denied rumors it was planning to bid this weekend for up to 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices , but prices refused to fall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;5	`` To me , that suggests some business is right around the corner , '' Lespinasse said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;6	Corn futures gained on news that China has temporarily halted corn exports to preserve grain for domestic use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;7	`` If China stays out of the market , their customers will have to come to us , '' Lespinasse said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0454;8	Wheat for December delivery rose 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.79 1-4 a bushel ; December corn rose 1 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.15 1-2 a bushel ; December oats rose 2 1-4 cents to dlrs 1.10 1-4 a bushel ; January soybeans rose 6 cents to dlrs 5.62 3-4 a bushel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;0	President Clinton on Friday served notice on the next Republican-controlled Congress that he would fight tax cuts that inflate the budget and any attempt to repeal a new ban on assault weapons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;1	`` I hope and believe we can cooperate with the new Congress , '' Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;2	`` But cooperation for me can not mean abandoning principle , abandoning the hard work we have already accomplished together in our fight to restore the economy , our fight against crime . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;3	Addressing a national meeting of mayors and city officiais , he drew the line against relaxing gun controls enacted by the just-ended Congress over opposition from the National Rifle Association .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;4	`` The assault weapons ban that you helped to win stands between the citizens you and I must protect and the gangs and thugs that would terrorize them , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;5	`` I will do all in my power to keep the next Congress from doing anything that will jeopardize the safety of our people . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;6	Clinton spoke before a White House meeting with Congress ' new Republican leaders , incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich , and the next Senate majority leader , Bob Dole .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;7	Separately , Clinton also met in the Cabinet Room with newly named Democratic leaders , who will be in the minority .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;8	`` It 's no secret that the landscape in Washington shifted dramatically last month , '' Clinton said ruefully , referring to the November elections that gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and a majority of U.S. state governorships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;9	The election results gave momentum to calls for middle-class tax cuts , an idea embraced by Republicans and Democrats alike .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;10	Clinton 's administration fears the rival parties might try to outdo each other on tax cuts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;11	He said he would fight any proposal that would `` explode the deficit ... my standard will be : Will it help increase incomes for the middle class , will it promote jobs and growth and can we pay for it ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;12	In his speech broadcast from Washington to the National League of Cities conference in Minneapolis , Clinton said , `` We need to give hard working middle-class people a dividend from the end of the Cold War and the dramatic downsizing of the federal government . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;13	The Republican campaign 's Contract with America called for an array of tax credits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;14	Clinton urged city officials who have been complaining about inadequate funds for essential services `` to make sure that the Congress understands what the consequences are of all these budgetary decisions . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0455;15	In the afterglow of bipartisan support for the new world trade agreement , Clinton said he hoped to work with Republicans on welfare and health-care reform , cost-controls on medical care and easing the financial demands imposed on cities and states by Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;0	Azerbaijan 's parliament passed an unusual law Friday guaranteeing a multibillion-dollar Caspian Sea oil development contract with a consortium of Western companies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;1	The law said simply that Azerbaijan 's parliament and president `` guarantee the implementation '' of the 30-year deal , which involves dlrs 7.4 billion in investments into three of the country 's oilfields .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;2	A consortium of eight Western oil companies and one Russian one signed the contract in September , and parliament ratified it Nov. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;3	But the Western partners wrote parliament last week saying ratification alone was not enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;4	In the absence of legislation regulating oil production , they asked for special guarantees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;5	Western partners have been made nervous partly because Azerbaijan has indicated it will turn to Iran for financing help .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;6	The consortium envisions the start of production about four years after development begins , increasing to a rate of about 86,000 metric tons -LRB- 600,000 barrels -RRB- a day by the end of the decade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0456;7	They expect to extract a total of 511 million metric tons -LRB- 3.5 billion barrels -RRB- of crude oil .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;0	Middle East champion Mohammed bin Sulayem swept to his eighth Dubai International Rally victory in 10 years Friday after his two main challengers found frustration on the second leg .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;1	Michel Saleh , leader for much of the first day and lying third overnight , went out within yards of the morning 's restart after a vain attempt to replace a broken drive shaft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;2	The Victory Rally Team 's Khalifa al-Mataywi , attempting to hold onto a diminishing advantage over Sulayem , lost the lead after being held up by Nasser Khalifa al-Attiya 's ailing Toyota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;3	Mataywi lost two-and-a-half minutes to Sulayem 's Ford Escort and the Arab world 's No. 1 driver went on to the finish with a winning margin of almost four minutes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;4	Sulayem 's triumph gave Ford the Middle East manufacturers ' championship for the first time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;5	The consolation for Mataywi was that his second place gave him his first United Arab Emirates championship and the runner-up spot in the regional series at the first attempt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0457;6	Finishing third in his Toyota , Saudi Arabia 's Middle East Group N champion , Abdullah Bakhashab , completed a hat-trick of production-class wins in Dubai .

APW_ENG_19941202.0457;8	Despite being edged out of the top 10 after her Group N Volkswagen Golf got stuck in soft sand , British ladies champion Stephanie Simmonite underlined her obvious talent by finishing 11th and also winning the ladies prize .

APW_ENG_19941202.0460;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;1	Yasushi Akashi , speaking at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , told reporters he had won assurances that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;2	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;3	Serbs had detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia for more than a week as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;4	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers who arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , after being held for seven days in eastern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;5	The U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia also said the Serbs had promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;6	Akashi said he was pleased with the `` willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;7	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;8	Earlier Friday , they once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency building minutes before Akashi arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;9	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic promised his side would normalize relations with the United Nations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;10	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;11	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;12	It was not immediately clear whether Karadzic 's comments hinted at potential stumbling blocks to carrying out the promises announced by Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;13	`` More or less , we can say we are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;14	Akashi went to Pale for talks with the Bosnian Serb leadership after meetings with Bosnia 's Muslim-led government in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;15	Shortly before he arrived at the presidency , where the Bosnian government has its offices , Bosnian Serb gunners ringing the capital fired two anti-tank missiles at the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;16	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic moments after he left for the Akashi meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;17	Lazovic is an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;18	A short while later , three more missiles hit nearby buildings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;19	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;20	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and blasted the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , as fighting continued in that northwest region Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;21	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;22	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;23	He was referring to European appeasement of Adolf Hitler at a 1938 meeting in Munich before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;24	Charles Redman , a U.S. diplomat , was also back in Sarajevo , leading talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic that presumably focused on a proposed new peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;25	Redman , now U.S. ambassador to Germany , helped draft the first international peace plan drawn up by the five-nation Contact Group , which the Serbs have repeatedly rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;26	Although that proposal was presented to the Serbs as a take-it-or-leave-it plan , the lack of Western will to use force has allowed the Serbs to demand , apparently successfully , the right of future confederal links with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;27	The original plan denied Serbs that as punishment for starting the war , though it granted the Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation similar rights to link with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;28	Akashi hoped to have more success with the Serbs than his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;29	Boutros-Ghali was rebuffed in even trying to meet the Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday , and afterwards said intransigence by the warring sides might force the end of the U.N. mission .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;30	Earlier , U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss with Karadzic the continued fighting around Bihac , where the United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;31	There was no immediate indication of any progress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;32	A number of detonations were reported on the edge of the Bihac `` safe area '' Friday , along with machine-gun and small arms fire , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;33	But the heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;34	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave , part of which is a U.N.-designated `` safe area , '' in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;35	There were also signs that the frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;36	Bosnian Croats , who are allied with the Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;37	A Croat militia and the Bosnian army took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;38	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia also had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0460;39	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;1	Yasushi Akashi , speaking at Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , told reporters he had won assurances that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;2	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;3	Serbs had detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia for more than a week as insurance against further NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;4	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers who arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , after being held for seven days in eastern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;5	The U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia also said the Serbs had promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;6	Akashi said he was pleased with the `` willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;7	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;8	Earlier Friday , they once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency building minutes before Akashi arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;9	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic promised his side would normalize relations with the United Nations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;10	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;11	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;12	It was not immediately clear whether Karadzic 's comments hinted at potential stumbling blocks to carrying out the promises announced by Akashi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0461;13	`` More or less , we can say we are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' Karadzic said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0462;0	Bosnian Serbs , seeing U.S. policy swinging in their favor , said Friday the new U.S. approach to the war in former Yugoslavia is `` a step in the right direction . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;1	But an emissary , Danielle Sremac , rejected some key elements of a peace proposal U.S. officials are now pushing in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;2	`` A U.S. policy change that recognizes the rights of Serbs in Bosnia is a step in the right direction , '' Ms. Sremac said , adding that U.S. policy is key to resolution of the 21\/2 - year war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;3	`` The U.S. policy of siding with the Muslims has been one of the main obstacles to peace , '' she said at a forum sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;4	A Belgrade-born U.S. citizen who is not recognized as an official emissary by the U.S. government , Ms. Sremac has served as a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Bosnian Serb leaders since May .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;5	She recently returned from consultations in Pale , the unofficial Bosnian Serb capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;6	The Clinton administration , rebuffed by Britain and France in its efforts to use more NATO military force to quell Serb aggression , is now working for a diplomatic solution in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;7	The latest U.S. stance provides `` a good sign for peace in Bosnia , '' Ms. Sremac said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;8	But she said Bosnian Serbs still demand a contiguous country of their own , links to other Serbian areas of the former Yugoslavia and control over parts of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities with large Serbian populations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;9	Secretary of State Warren Christopher , at NATO meetings in Brussels , has been promoting a new U.S. plan that calls for an international conference to resolve the crisis and a three - to six-month cease-fire around besieged Bihac , which Serbs are poised to overrun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;10	Ms. Sremac said Bosnian Serbs reject the cease-fire because it would give Bosnia 's outgunned government forces the winter months to regroup and plan new attacks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;11	Bosnian Serbs want permanent ceasefire negotiations , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;12	They also continue to reject the plan drawn up by the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia that would allow them to control about half of the country but still maintain Bosnia 's borders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;13	U.S. officials , however , have expressed a new willingness to discuss a political link between Serbia and Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;14	Christopher said this week that political union between the Serbs in Bosnia with Serbia itself might be possible `` if it would mean reaching a peaceful resolution '' of the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;15	A link among Serbs in former Yugoslav states has been a principle demand of Bosnian Serbs throughout the war that has killed 200,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;16	A Serb union would likely mean the end of Bosnia as a multiethnic state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0462;17	Bosnian Serbs , who hold about 70 percent of Bosnia , would be willing to accept some reduction in the territory they now control , Ms. Sremac said , if they could form a `` fully functioning state '' and establish ties to Serbia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0467;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official denied Friday that the alliance had abandoned its enforcement of the U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said , amid continued confusion between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over how to deal with the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;2	Earlier Friday , Wing Commander Timothy Hewlet , U.N. director for air operations in Bosnia , told reporters in Sarajevo that Bosnian Serbs had activated several surface-to-air missile sites throughout the country , threatening humanitarian flights and NATO jets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;3	Hewlet said NATO had agreed to a `` cooling off '' period to calm tensions , but was able to `` control '' the situation with AWACs radar planes flying outside Bosnian air space .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;4	`` There are no flights over Bosnia at the moment that I am aware of , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;5	At NATO headquarters , Secretary-General Willy Claes said he was unaware of any request from the United Nations to halt or scale-down allied patrols enforcing the military flight ban , designed to protect Bosnian civilians from bombardment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;6	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;7	However , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in former Yugoslavia , acknowledged talks on the issue were under way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;8	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;9	`` But I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR -LRB- the U.N. protection force -RRB- in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;10	NATO and the United Nations have repeatedly talked of the need to `` show presence '' in the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;11	But NATO sources in Brussels said allied planes had been fired on nine times in recent days by Serb missiles and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;12	Under current rules of engagement , NATO planes can strike back if targeted without seeking prior approval from the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;13	Thant Myint-U , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , cautioned that such retaliation could lead to an increase in fighting at a time when international negotiators were trying to revive flagging peace efforts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;14	`` There would be massive escalation in the situation on the ground that could spin out of control , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;15	Christopher told reporters that Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;16	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them , `` and we continue to police the ` no-fly ' zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;17	In Washington however , a senior U.S. military officer , speaking on condition of anonymity , acknowledged that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;18	He would not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;19	On Tuesday , officials said the United Nations requested and NATO agreed that planes would not fly over Bosnia for a 48-hour period while U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other peace negotiators visited Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;20	Western military sources said it appeared that request was extended slightly , and it was not clear if NATO planes were back in Bosnian airspace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;21	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , speaking in Pale after his meeting with Akashi , said , `` We would like to see skies clear of ... NATO aircraft . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0467;22	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents , '' Karadzic added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;0	All of the recognizable names have dropped out of a conference pitched by the Clinton administration as a `` first-ever '' hemispheric gathering on trade and finance at the Summit of the Americas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;1	The accumulated cancellations by top U.S. officials are an embarrassment for the White House , which has been criticized for slighting trade -- the top priority of Latin American and Caribbean leaders -- on the 34-nation summit agenda .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;2	`` The -LRB- public relations staff -RRB- may have a little problem fixing that one , '' said Steve Albee , publisher of Inside Latin America , a Miami newsletter produced for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;3	`` The summit may end up being a great big barbecue , but with little accomplished . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;4	Calls to the White House for comment were not immediately returned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;5	Asked whether the disrupted schedule validated criticism about the U.S. commitment to improved trade in the hemisphere , a U.S. government source speaking on condition of anonymity said Friday , `` sort of makes you wonder , does n't it ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;6	This week 's GATT votes and schedule conflicts were given as explanations for the cancellations , but passage of the world trade agreement would have given U.S. officials bragging rights at the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;7	Vice President Al Gore ca n't make it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;8	Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will send three-minute video greetings instead of giving keynote speeches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;9	Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles canceled Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;10	In their place will be an assortment of undersecretaries , deputies and assistants , but no big wheels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;11	Customs Commissioner George Weise is still committed to the conference sponsored by his agency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;12	Lame-duck Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis will offer luncheon introductions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;13	`` We are still of the opinion that we have an exceedingly high-caliber group of speakers and panelists , '' Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;14	Versions of the much-altered schedule note the times they were written so organizers know they 're dealing with the latest draft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;15	About 1,000 people , including 300 foreigners , signed up for the Customs Service conference on customs , trade and finance by Wednesday 's deadline , said Sheehan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;16	They wo n't get word of the new lineup until they register .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;17	One of the conference attractions promoted in a four-color brochure was `` direct access '' to U.S. and foreign customs , banking and finance officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;18	`` The thrust of our conference from the beginning has been to allow people , ordinary business people involved in international trade , an opportunity to have access to and resolve problems with the actual government officials and private sector experts that they need to deal with , '' Sheehan said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;19	The conference was formulated in November in place of a business roundtable announced by Brown with great fanfare on a special trip to Miami on Oct. 28 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;20	It was the same day an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal complained of a lack of trade emphasis in summit planning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;21	Brown 's roundtable never materialized .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;22	`` I know that the Customs summit was put together in an effort to make the business community feel that the summit had some value , and it 's unfortunate that the big guns have decided not to be there , '' Albee said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0469;23	`` The whole thing was added to try to bring the business community into the event . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official denied Friday that the alliance had abandoned its enforcement of the U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said , amid continued confusion between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over how to deal with the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;2	Earlier Friday , Wing Commander Timothy Hewlet , U.N. director for air operations in Bosnia , told reporters in Sarajevo that Bosnian Serbs had activated several surface-to-air missile sites throughout the country , threatening humanitarian flights and NATO jets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;3	Hewlet said NATO had agreed to a `` cooling off '' period to calm tensions , but was able to `` control '' the situation with AWACs radar planes flying outside Bosnian air space .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;4	`` There are no flights over Bosnia at the moment that I am aware of , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;5	At NATO headquarters , Secretary-General Willy Claes said he was unaware of any request from the United Nations to halt or scale-down allied patrols enforcing the military flight ban , designed to protect Bosnian civilians from bombardment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;6	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;7	However , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in former Yugoslavia , acknowledged talks on the issue were under way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;8	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;9	`` But I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR -LRB- the U.N. protection force -RRB- in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;10	NATO and the United Nations have repeatedly talked of the need to `` show presence '' in the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;11	But NATO sources in Brussels said allied planes had been fired on nine times in recent days by Serb missiles and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;12	Under current rules of engagement , NATO planes can strike back if targeted without seeking prior approval from the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;13	Thant Myint-U , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo , cautioned that such retaliation could lead to an increase in fighting at a time when international negotiators were trying to revive flagging peace efforts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;14	`` There would be massive escalation in the situation on the ground that could spin out of control , '' Thant said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;15	Christopher told reporters that Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;16	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them , `` and we continue to police the ` no-fly ' zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;17	In Washington however , a senior U.S. military officer , speaking on condition of anonymity , acknowledged that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;18	He would not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;19	On Tuesday , officials said the United Nations requested and NATO agreed that planes would not fly over Bosnia for a 48-hour period while U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other peace negotiators visited Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;20	Western military sources said it appeared that request was extended slightly , and it was not clear if NATO planes were back in Bosnian airspace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;21	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , speaking in Pale after his meeting with Akashi , said , `` We would like to see skies clear of ... NATO aircraft . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0470;22	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents , '' Karadzic added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;0	American Hilary Lindh overcame a course that does n't suit her to win the opening women 's World Cup downhill ski race of the season on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;1	Just one day after dismissing herself as a favorite , Lindh flashed to a winning margin of 29-hundredths of a second over Isolde Kostner of Italy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;2	Defending World Cup downhill champion Katja Seizinger of Germany finished third .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;3	Austria 's Stefanie Schuster overcame a late start number to finish a career-best fourth , Switzerland 's Heidi Zurbriggen was fifth , and Sweden 's Pernilla Wiberg took sixth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;4	Lindh , the 1992 Olympic downhill silver medalist , won for only the second time on the World Cup circuit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;5	Her first career victory came last February in a downhill in Sierra Nevada , Spain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;6	The 25-year-old Alaskan , whose best previous finish on this course was sixth place two years ago , was timed in 1 minute , 45.00 seconds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;7	A day earlier , Lindh said , `` Certain people have courses they do well on , and this does n't happen to be one of mine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;8	I 've always had a hard time on the turns at the bottom .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;9	The last 20 seconds is where I lose it all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;10	`` I do n't know if I nailed it -LRB- the bottom -RRB- , but it was very much improved from training , '' Lindh said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;11	`` It felt solid and pretty quick . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;12	Kostner , the last of the top-seeded skiers to complete the run , could n't overtake Lindh , coming across in 1:45.29 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;13	Seizinger was timed in 1:45.44 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;14	Kostner , 19 , who has had six top-three finishes in the last two seasons including two Olympic bronze medals , said , `` This was n't surprising because in training I was skiing well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;15	I always like to go fast . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;16	`` When I saw Hilary 's time , I knew she had had a great run , '' Seizinger said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;17	`` The first two-thirds of this course is very flat , a little problem for me .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;18	But third place is n't bad . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;19	Three other favorites -- Anja Haas of Austria , Melanie Suchet of France and American Picabo Street -- fell and did not finish .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;20	Street made a minor mistake early in her run and , in an effort to make up time , got out of control near the finish , did the splits and crashed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;21	Haas had the fastest intermediate time one-third of the way down the course when she fell .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;22	American Megan Gerety came in eighth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;23	The top Canadian was Kate Pace , who had trouble at the bottom and placed 11th .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;24	Vreni Schneider of Switzerland , the overall standings leader , was 23rd .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;25	For the first time , downhillers in the top seed of 15 were allowed to select starting numbers from 1 through 30 , and most of the favorites chose numbers in the 20s .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;26	The course appeared to speed up slightly during the race as a bright sun glazed the snow , making it slicker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0471;27	A super-G is scheduled here Saturday with a giant slalom on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;0	The United States has elevated Greece to a `` priority watch list '' because of alleged piracy of American motion pictures and recordings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;1	U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Friday a `` large number '' of unlicensed Greek television stations are broadcasting American movies without paying the U.S. motion picture industry for their use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;2	`` We note that the Greek government has very recently moved against one such station , '' Kantor said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;3	`` We hope this is the start of a sustained campaign against these unauthorized broadcasts . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;4	If it were , the United States could re-examine Greece 's status , Kantor said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;5	But continued unauthorized broadcast of copyrighted material could result in a formal investigation leading to retaliation against imports from Greece , he added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;6	Two other nations -- Egypt and the United Arab Emirates -- were kept on a U.S. non-priority watch list .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;7	Kantor urged Egypt to enact a strong patent law that would protect foreign pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals from piracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0472;8	He also said the U.S. government remains concerned about alleged piracy of computer software and other copyrighted material in the UAE .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;0	The estranged wife of President Alberto Fujimori has announced she will run for Congress and head a new political alliance in next year 's elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;1	Susana Higuchi , who previously was disqualified from seeking the presidency , announced her congressional candidacy Thursday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;2	She said she would lead a coalition between her Harmony 21st Century party and the Civilian , Military and Police Front , known by its acronym FREMPOL .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;3	FREMPOL is small party made up mostly of retired police and career military officers whose main interest is increasing their pensions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;4	The alliance gives Higuchi the chance to stand for Congress because FREMPOL is already qualified to take part in the April 9 elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;5	Higuchi 's party was disqualified in October along with her presidential bid for lack of sufficient signatures on its election petition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;6	But the National Elections Board said it would still have to rule on whether Higuchi is eligible to hold national office .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;7	Congress in July passed a law , known locally as the `` Susana Law , '' prohibiting the president 's immediate family members from running for president , vice president or Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;8	The elections board on Friday published a ruling that banned the state-run news media from promoting political candidates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;9	It was aimed at ending the pro-Fujimori publicity in the state-owned newspaper , television channel and radio station .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;10	The board 's ruling came in response to on-going criticism by the opposition that Fujimori is taking advantage of his office to campaign at state expense .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;11	The board said the state media , government officials , the police and the military were prohibited from engaging in political campaigning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;12	But it said the public stations and newspaper could accept paid political advertising .
APW_ENG_19941202.0473;13	It also said the state television and radio stations should , as a traditional public service , run free half-hour spots for candidates once a day during the month before the elections .
APW_ENG_19941202.0474;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia on Friday sought to revive the peace initiative for Bosnia by unveiling new proposals including the suggestion of a confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0474;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations launched a new drive to end the fighting , after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0474;2	After the meeting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters that at the meeting it was agreed `` to devise a constitutional arrangement '' enabling Bosnian Serbs to link up politically with Belgrade without somehow undermining the integrity as a sovereign nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0474;3	Juppe and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd will travel to Belgrade on Sunday to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , on Sunday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;0	When the Rolling Stones began their current concer tour , there were worries that time was no longer on their side .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;1	But despite some heavy competition , the Stones are likely to end 1994 as the year 's top concert draw in North America , according to two concert industry trade publications .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;2	When their U.S. tiour ends on Dec. 18 , the Stones will have earned an estimated dlrs 119.4 million , Performance magazine said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;3	That total does n't count four shows where the band did n't report its earnings because of slow ticket sales .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;4	More than 2 million people have seen the Stones this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;5	`` They 're still incredible performers , '' said Jane Cohen , senior editor of Performance , on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;6	`` They 're still the premiere rock 'n' roll band .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;7	But I do n't think you 're going to see them tour at this level again . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;8	Ticket sales for the Stones ' tour were initially slow , but that was largely because there was so much competition on the road , said Gary Bongiovanni , editor of Pollstar , which will also report the Stones as top earners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;9	Pink Floyd , which lumbers along despite internal strife and poorly-received albums , drew more than 3 million fans and earned dlrs 104.6 million , Performance said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;10	Billy Joel performed before nearly 2 million people and earned dlrs 75.8 million to finish third , followed by the Eagles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;11	Barbra Streisand , criticized for steep ticket prices , took in dlrs 58.9 million while performing before nearly 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;12	More than four times as many people saw Elton John , but his concert gross was only dlrs 56.8 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;13	The Grateful Dead , the Lollapalooza tour , Phil Collins and Michael Bolton rounded out Performance 's list of top earners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;14	`` It 's been a very good year for concerts , '' Bongiovanni said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;15	R.E.M. , Tom Petty and Van Halen are expected to be among the big concert draws next year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;16	Former Led Zeppelin partners Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are heading on tour , Bongiovanni said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0477;17	The Eagles , who had to reschedule concerts because of Glenn Frey 's illness , will also be back on the road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;0	Part of an express train headed from eastern out 70 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;1	The second car of the express train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and the overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;2	`` There was a tremedous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;3	He said in a telephone interview that people remained buried in the wreckage into Friday night , although the crash occured at 4:45 p.m. local time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;4	State television showed horrific pictures of battered and broken railway cars covered in brick torn loose from the building and rescue crews frantically dragging bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;5	Laszlo Garamvoelgyi , a National Police spokesman , said the death toll had risen to 21 by late Friday with 60 others injured , some seriously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;6	With temperatures below freezing and others left in the wreckage the death toll was expected to rise - Garamvoelgyi said the latest count `` was not the final one by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;7	The severity of the accident eclipsed the previous most serious train tragedy of recent years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;8	Ten children died last February , in a bus-train collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;9	Transport ministry officials said the accident occured at a rail switch and suggested that it was possibly caused by the switch not being thrown .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;10	They had no information about the speed of the train when the cars derailed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;11	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said 26 injured , including two critical cases , were admitted to their hospital alone , with several others also taking in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;12	Among senior officials at the scene by late Friday evening was Interior Minister Laszlo Kuncze .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;13	`` We are witnesses to a terrible tragedy , '' Kuncze said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0478;14	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained peacekeepers and allow free movement of certain U.N. convoys , the chief U.N. envoy announced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;1	Yasushi Akashi , speaking after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his headquarters east of Sarajevo , told reporters he had been assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers kidnapped in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British resupply convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;2	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians ... and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;3	Serbs detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia as insurance against further NATO airstrikes after alliance planes struck Serb targets three times last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;4	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers , detained with a convoy bound for the eastern enclave of Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;5	Akashi also said the Serbs promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;6	`` I am very pleased to find willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;7	Whether the promises would be fulfilled remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;8	Karadzic promised normalized relations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;9	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said , without elaborating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;10	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;11	Karadzic also issued a veiled warning against NATO warplanes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;12	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircrafts and of NATO aircrafts , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;13	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;14	NATO sources said allied planes had been fired on by Serb missiles nine times in recent days and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;15	Akashi , addressing conflicting reports over whether NATO warplanes were over Bosnia enforcing the U.N. `` no fly '' zone , said :
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;16	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;17	`` But , I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;18	Under rules of engagement , NATO planes can defend themselves against attack without prior U.N. approval .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;19	U.N. officials fear that could escalate tensions as they try to salvage stalled peace talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;20	`` What may seem as an innocent step ... can be fraught with difficulties , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0479;21	`` For example , this NATO air activity : the NATO flying over the skies may also bring about enhanced air defense system against which then NATO has to bring in more planes to defend itself , so we have to ... break this vicious circle . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0481;0	Stocks posted substantial gains Friday as bond prices rallied on economic data that showed steady but non-inflationary growth in the economy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;1	Traders said the market was also staging a technical rebound from losses earlier this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;2	Bond prices moved sharply higher , with the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond up more than dlrs 10 per dlrs 1,000 face value and yielding 7.91 percent .

APW_ENG_19941202.0481;6	The overall jobs data showed a stronger-than expected growth in the economy , which analysts said might encourage the Federal Reserve to further tighten interest rates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;7	But fears of higher interest rates were softened by the wage and work-week components of the Labor Department report , as well as a drop of 0.1 percent in October in the government 's index of leading indicators , and a 0.4-percentage point drop in factory orders in October , analysts said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;8	Bonds initially dipped on the jobs report but then quickly rallied , pulling stocks higher with them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;9	`` The conclusion , at least for today -- and it 's only tentative -- is that the economy is going to slow to a no-boom , no-bust sustainable , non-inflationary pace , '' said Hugh Johnson , chief market strategist at First Albany Corp.
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;10	But Johnson and others said the market had been technically poised to rally after losing substantial ground earlier in the week , and that technical factors , like program trading , were responsible for some of the market 's gains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;11	`` Stock investors are very very tentative , '' Johnson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;12	`` The level of confidence is not high . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;13	The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stock rose 44.75 to 3,745.62 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;14	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange , with 1,397 up , 899 down and 623 unchanged .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;15	Big Board volume totaled 284.74 million shares as of 4 p.m. -LRB- 2100 GMT -RRB- , against 285.93 million in the previous session .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;16	The NYSE 's composite index rose 1.97 to 248.01 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0481;17	Standard and Poor 's 500-stock index rose 4.38 to 453.30 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0481;19	At the American Stock Exchange , the market value index rose 1.27 to 452.46 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;0	Speaking to reporters after the meeting , Christopher made clear that the current peace initiative , and its territorial division giving Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of the territory , remains intact .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;1	`` The contact group plan with its 51-49 division of territory , must be the basis of a settlement of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;2	Allowing a link up between the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia has been one of the main war aims of the Serbs and will be seen as a step towards the `` Greater Serbia '' which has so far been resisted by the West .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;3	Hurd said the alternative to a negotiated settlement that provides for some form of Serb confederation is `` more dangerous , even disastrous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;4	Earlier , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic suggested that the possible offer of confederal links with Serbia would not be enough to get his side to accept a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;5	He asked for international recognition of the Bosnian Serb sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;6	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;7	Then we can stay in association with Muslims , Croats , Serbia etc , '' Karadzic said at his headquarters in Pale , Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;8	`` We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;9	The idea of a political alliance of Bosnian Serbs with Belgrade is akin to the confederation that the current peace plan -- rejected by the Bosnian Serbs -- allows between Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-led government with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0482;10	The contact group nations also called for an immediate end to all hostilities across Bosnia , especially in the embattled enclave of Bihac , and demanded free passage for U.N. peacekeeping forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0483;0	First-place Borussia Dortmund defeated MSV Duisburg 1-0 Friday to win some distance from pursuers in the Bundesliga , Germany 's first-division soccer league .
APW_ENG_19941202.0483;1	Veteran national player Karlheinz Riedle scored in the 45th minute for Dortmund , which went into the weekend 's round only one point ahead of Werder Bremen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0483;2	On Saturday , Bremen plays away at Karlsruhe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0483;3	In Friday 's only other game , Stefan Kuntz scored in the 81st minute to give Kaiserslautern a tough 1-1 tie at home with 1860 Munich .
APW_ENG_19941202.0483;4	Bernhard Winkler headed in a goal for Munich in the 54th minute .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of peacekeepers and allow aid deliveries as the chief U.N. envoy tried to salvage what was left of the ailing U.N. mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;1	Earlier , Serb gunners surrounding Sarajevo hit the presidency building with anti-tank missiles just minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;2	It was yet another sign of Serb contempt for the peacekeeping effort , which has virtually ground to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;3	The Serb rebels have stopped U.N. aid convoys , attacked a U.N.-declared `` safe area , '' and taken peacekeepers hostage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;4	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with European foreign ministers to discuss a U.S. plan for a cease-fire that would lead to peace talks in the 2 -LCB- - year-old war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;5	The plan would grant the Serbs their main aim in the conflict : the right to ties with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;6	The Serbs on Friday released 70 peacekeepers who had been held a week , but more than 300 peacekeepers remained hostage as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;7	Two wire-guided missiles hit the presidency building minutes before Akashi arrived for talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;8	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic , an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;9	Three missiles hit nearby buildings while Akashi was meeting top government and military officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;10	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;11	`` Until we achieve something tangible , this shuttle diplomacy must continue , '' Akashi told reporters before leaving for Pale , the Bosnian Serb headquarters east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;12	Akashi later said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had promised to release hundreds of detained peacekeepers and allow free movement of aid convoys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;13	`` More or less , we can say we are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;14	But he also called for more talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;15	The Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for not using force to halt fighting at Bihac , the embattled government-held enclave in the northwest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;16	Serb forces have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the `` safe area , '' and fighting continued there Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;17	U.S. Ambassador to Germany Charles Redman held talks in Sarajevo with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the U.S. peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;18	Redman helped draft an earlier plan that the Serbs rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;19	The war began when Serbs rebelled against a vote for independence from Yugoslavia by Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;20	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the war , and the Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;21	Following the secession during the past three years of Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Macedonia , Yugoslavia now is comprised only of Serbia and tiny Montenegro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;22	Serb nationalists in Yugoslavia , Croatia and Bosnia have pressed for a unified `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;23	The rejected peace plan denied Serbs the right to links with Yugoslavia as punishment for starting the war and granted them 49 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;24	It allowed Bosnia 's Croats and Muslims the right to ties with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;25	Akashi hopes to have more success than U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was rebuffed Wednesday when he tried to meet with Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;26	Boutros-Ghali said afterwards that intransigence by the warring sides might force the U.N. mission to withdraw .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;27	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;28	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , plus hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;29	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss the fighting around Bihac with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;30	The United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;31	Machine-gun and small arms fire was reported on the outskirts of Bihac , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;32	The heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;33	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;34	There were also signs that fronts south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;35	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;36	Croat militia and Bosnian army soldiers took Kupres from the Serbs last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;37	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;38	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;39	In Knin , Croatia , the Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0484;40	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;0	Normally , it 's everyday grind and work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;1	But how they miss the essence of it , playing the game of ice hockey .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;2	That is what the NHL stars have been doing almost since toddlers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;3	That became very clear as the Ninety-Nine All Stars arrived in Finland Friday night , with a light workout before an intended six-game tour in the Nordic countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;4	`` I did n't realize how much I missed the game until we got out there and started fooling for a couple of days of practice and then going on to play yesterday in Detroit , '' said Brett Hull of the St. Louis Blues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;5	`` Hockey is just a part of our being , and we want to show the NHL that there is a reason for people to come and watch , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;6	A group of elite NHL players chosen by Wayne Gretzky , many of them his best friends , will play Finnish champion Jokerit of Helsinki Saturday and Ilves in Tampere Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;7	For Gretzky , it is the second time playing in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;8	In 1982 he came to the World Championships in Helsinki and Tampere and emerged as the top scorer after a slow start .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;9	Canada won the bronze medal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;10	Gretzky is joined by some very old friends from the same season 's roster 13 years ago at Edmonton Oilers : goalie Grant Fuhr , defensemen Paul Coffey and Charlie Huddy and forwards Mark Messier and Jari Kurri .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;11	The latter plays for Jokerit during the NHL lockout , but received permission to join Gretzky and Messier for Saturday 's game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;12	Eighteen players arrived in Helsinki three hours late and took the ice immediately in front of some 2,000 teenage fans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;13	`` This group of players is the best you 've seen in a long time , '' said Gretzky .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;14	`` We all had an enjoyable four , five days already .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;15	We 're happy to have had a light skate tonight and we 're excited to play tomorrow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;16	The game is on Hockey Canada back home and people in Canada are going to see some good hockey . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;17	In Saturday 's game , the Ninety-Nine All Stars will meet Finland 's currently best team , featuring Teemu Selanne , the Winnipeg Jets forward who was the NHL top goalscorer and the Rookie of the Year in 1992-93 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;18	Gretzky promised there will be no light showboating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;19	`` I think the players we have together are not quite like an All Star-team , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;20	`` We have players that play some NHL-style hockey , with intensity and force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;21	We expect to hit , we expect to get hit .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;22	`` I think that the game will be more physical than you thought it would be .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;23	Players like -LRB- Rick -RRB- Tocchet and -LRB- Mark -RRB- Messier are going to play their regular game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;24	But it 's not going to be like game 7 of the Stanley Cup either .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;25	We intend to have some fun '' .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;26	Gretzky 's team lost its first game 4-3 Thursday to the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League at Auburn Hills , Mich.
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;27	But the All-Stars were shorthanded , playing with only four defensemen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;28	Three Detroit Red Wings , Steve Yzerman , Sergei Fedorov and Paul Coffey also skipped the game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0485;29	Gretzky 's team will play a Norwegian All-Star team in Oslo on Monday before heading to Sweden and three games against Djurgarden of Stockholm , Vastra Frolunda of Goteborg and Malmo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;0	An express train derailed southeast of Budapest Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station and burying people under the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;1	At least 21 people were killed , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;2	The accident occurred at 4:45 p.m. in Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;3	The second car of the train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and the overturned carriages crashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;4	`` There was a tremendous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;5	He said in a telephone interview that some people remained buried in the wreckage into Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;6	`` We are witnesses to a terrible tragedy , '' said Interior Minister Laszlo Kuncze , who was among the senior officials at the scene late Friday evening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;7	State television showed pictures of battered and broken railway cars covered in bricks torn loose from the building with rescue crews frantically dragging bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;8	National police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi said the death toll had risen to 21 by late Friday with 60 others injured , some seriously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;9	With temperatures below freezing and others still trapped in the wreckage , the death toll was expected to rise , Garamvoelgyi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;10	Transport ministry officials said the accident occurred at a rail switch and suggested it was possibly caused by the switch not being thrown .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;11	They had no information about the speed of the train when the cars derailed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;12	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok said 26 injured people , including two critical cases , had been admitted to their hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;13	Several other hospitals were also taking in the injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0487;14	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest , to the capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;0	Russian lawmakers negotiating the release of prisoners in Chechnya accused their own government Friday of sending the jets that have attacked the breakaway republic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;1	Four Russian legislators , representing parliament 's military committee , are trying to get Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev to release about 70 Russians , including army soldiers , who were captured in fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;2	Dudayev , who declared independence for his Caucasus Mountain republic in 1991 , says Moscow is arming and leading the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;3	President Boris Yeltsin 's government has denied providing anything but political support , even as jets have attacked and Russian soldiers have been captured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;4	Jets roared over Grozny , the Chechen capital , for a fourth day Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;5	Raids this week have killed at least four civilians and an airport guard , and destroyed planes at civilian and military airports .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;6	`` It is clear that these planes are not English or French , but Russian , '' said Ella Pamfilova , a member of the parliament delegation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;7	`` This is against the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;8	`` You can rest assured that President Yeltsin has recognized the prisoners as members of the Russian Army , '' delegation leader Sergei Yushenkov said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;9	Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has called the captives mercenaries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;10	A dozen prisoners , interviewed by The Associated Press while Chechen guards watched , said they were promised money by Russia 's Federal Counterintelligence Service for fighting with the Chechen rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;11	But they said the operations went badly , and that some of their Chechen allies did not know how to use guns and fled .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;12	Counterintelligence spokesman Alexander Mikhailov , asked about such reports at a news conference Friday , said only that Chechnya is part of Russia and that the servicemen should be called volunteers , not mercenaries , ITAR-Tass and Interfax said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;13	Dudayev first threatened to kill the prisoners if Russia did not claim them , but later said they would be tried in court .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;14	Yeltsin had threatened to send troops if they were not released .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;15	Moscow has toned down the threat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;16	But it continued to beef up troops on Chechnya 's borders , news reports said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;17	Since the air offensive began last week , thousands of people have fled Grozny , a city of 300,000 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;18	Russia conquered the mainly Muslim Chechens in its imperial drive toward the Black Sea last century .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;19	Suppressed ethnic tensions have boiled over since the 1991 Soviet collapse .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;20	Many Russian nationalists vow never to let Chechnya go .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;21	The opposition accuses Dudayev of running Chechnya 's economy into the ground .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;22	The main industry , oil refining , is operating at 10 percent of capacity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;23	But Chechen pride and age-old enmity with Russia have rallied many people to Dudayev 's side , including volunteers from other Caucasus regions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;24	At a pro-Dudayev camp outside Grozny , 24-year-old Sergei Chicherov , a blue-eyed Cossack , had cast his lot with the Chechens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0488;25	`` If someone comes and attacks your home , are you supposed to just sit and watch ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0489;0	In a statement , the contact group nations said the 49 percent of land offered to the Serbs and the 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat alliance under the group 's plan , `` can be adjusted by mutual agreement between the parties . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0489;1	The statement said both the Bosnian Serbs and the Croat-Muslim group should be allowed `` equitable and balanced arrangements . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0489;2	The Bosnian Serbs currently control some 70 percent of the territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0490;0	An express train derailed southeast of Budapest Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station and burying people under the rubble .

APW_ENG_19941202.0491;1	Company cars and employees of the prominent Most Group , headed by banker Vladimir Gusinsky , were searched as they tried to leave the building , which houses city government and Most Group offices .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;2	The Interior Ministry told Gusinsky the gunmen were part of a task force against organized crime , Gusinsky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;3	But the banker called it the latest case of harassment of Russia 's entrepreneurs and drafted a letter to President Boris Yeltsin demanding an investigation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;4	He said the armed men blocked off his offices without explanation Friday afternoon and left about five hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;5	Two Most Group drivers and four guards were detained , regional prosecutor Alexander Silykhovkin said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;6	He gave no other details .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;7	The Interfax news agency cited non-official sources as saying the action was in response to shots fired near the building , which is across the street from the White House , the Russian government 's headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;8	The Most Group comprises more than 10 different companies , including a bank , newspaper and TV network .
APW_ENG_19941202.0491;9	The Association of Russian Banks issued a protest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;0	Azerbaijan 's parliament guaranteed Friday a multibillion-dollar Caspian Sea oil development contract with a consortium of foreign companies that had sought greater security for their investment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;1	The unusual law said Azerbaijan 's parliament and president `` guarantee the implementation '' of the 30-year deal , which involves $ 7.4 billion to develop three sites containing an estimated 3.6 billion barrels of oil .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;2	A consortium of eight Western oil companies and one Russian company signed the contract in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;3	Parliament ratified it Nov. 15 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;4	But the Western partners said last week that in the absence of legislation regulating oil production special guarantees were also needed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;5	The companies have been nervous partly because Azerbaijan traded a quarter of its 20 percent stake in the project to Iran in exchange for financing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;6	The consortium expects to start pumping oil in about four years and eventually produce about 600,000 barrels of oil a day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;7	The consortium includes British Petroleum PLC , Amoco Corp. , Pennzoil Co. , Ramco Oil Services Inc. , Unocal Corp. , McDermott International Inc. , Turkish Petroleum Co. and Norway 's Statoil AS .
APW_ENG_19941202.0493;8	The Russian company Lukoil and the Azerbaijani state oil company are also participants .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;0	Riddick Bowe , the odd man out in the heavyweight title picture , tries to fight his way back in Saturday night in a risky bout against undefeated Larry Donald .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;1	Thirteen months after losing his heavyweight titles to Evander Holyfield , there are more questions than answers about a fighter many predicted would dominate the heavyweight ranks for a long time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;2	Injury and weight problems have dogged Bowe , who has been mostly inactive since losing a close decision to Holyfield .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;3	Take away an aborted no contest fight against Buster Mathis Jr. and the best shots Bowe has thrown since his loss were a left-right combination to Donald 's head at a Los Angeles news conference this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;4	`` I 'm still the best heavyweight in the world , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;5	`` As long as I 'm in shape I beat all of them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;6	They can only hope I 'm fat and come in out of condition . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;7	That hope may have been put to rest Thursday when Bowe weighed in at 241 pounds -LRB- 109 kilos -RRB- for the scheduled 12-round fight at Caesars Palace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;8	It was the lightest Bowe has weighed since winning the titles from Holyfield in November 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;9	`` This is the best I 've felt since the first Holyfield fight , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;10	Bowe , who has seen the WBA and IBF titles he once held change hands twice more since his loss , is taking a chance fighting Donald , an up-and-coming 1992 Olympian who is undefeated in 16 professional fights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;11	But he has little choice in a division where the two acknowledged champions , George Foreman and Oliver McCall , have shown no interest in fighting him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;12	`` Foreman will never fight Riddick Bowe and it 's just as well , '' Bowe 's manager , Rock Newman , said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;13	`` He would get massacred .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;14	McCall will never fight Riddick either , but who cares about him . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;15	Bowe instead hopes to tiptoe around the three major boxing organizations by beating Donald to set up a fight against Herbie Hide , who holds the lightly regarded WBO version of the crown .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;16	Newman said negotiations were close to being finalized for a fight against Hide in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;17	`` I believe I can legitimize the WBO the same way Larry Holmes legitimized the IBF , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;18	`` I do n't care what title I have as long as it indicates I 'm heavyweight champion of the world . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;19	First , though , there 's the matter of Donald , who is a slick boxer and has shown flashes of power in scoring 12 knockouts in 16 wins as a pro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;20	Boxers who can move have given Bowe -LRB- 34-1 -RRB- trouble in the past , but he is a 4-1 pick to beat Donald .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;21	`` It 's going to be a great fight if Larry comes to fight , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;22	`` He 's perhaps a little better than Mathis because he 's more my size and he possesses a good left jab .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;23	If he has a chin , he 'll take a beating for 12 rounds . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;24	Donald , who weighed in at 228 pounds -LRB- 103 kilos -RRB- , is 27 , the same age as Bowe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;25	But he did n't take up boxing until he was 19 and developed late as an amateur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;26	Donald 's biggest fights have been a decision win over Jeremy Williams and a knockout of former heavyweight contender Bert Cooper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;27	`` I 'm on my way up , '' Donald said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;28	`` I 'm loaded with confidence for this fight . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;29	By taking the fight , Donald , whose first pro fight was in January 1993 , violated the boxing maxim that a young contender should never be put in a tough fight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;30	But his trainer , Janks Morton , said the fight was one Donald actively sought .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;31	`` Bowe is the best heavyweight out there , that 's why we asked for him , '' Morton said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;32	`` Larry Donald is a better heavyweight than Bowe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0495;33	Bowe will earn dlrs 1 million for the fight , while Donald will get dlrs 490,000 , his biggest payday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia on Friday sought to revive the peace initiative for Bosnia by unveiling new proposals , including a confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations launched a new drive to end the fighting , after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;2	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters that at the meeting it was agreed `` to devise a constitutional arrangement '' enabling Bosnian Serbs to link up politically with Belgrade without undermining the integrity as a sovereign nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;3	Juppe and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd will travel on Sunday to Belgrade , the Serbian capital , for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;4	Speaking to reporters after the meeting , Christopher made clear that the current peace initiative -- and its territorial division giving Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of the territory -- remains intact .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;5	`` The contact group plan with its 51-49 division of territory , must be the basis of a settlement of the conflict . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;6	Allowing a link up between the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia has been one of the main war aims of the Serbs and will be seen as a step toward the `` Greater Serbia '' which has so far been resisted by the West .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;7	Hurd said the alternative to a negotiated settlement that provides for some form of Serb confederation is `` more dangerous , even disastrous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;8	Earlier , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic suggested that the possible offer of confederal links with Serbia would not be enough to get his side to accept a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;9	He asked for international recognition of the Bosnian Serb sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;10	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;11	Then we can stay in association with Muslims , Croats , Serbia etc , '' Karadzic said at his headquarters in Pale , Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;12	`` We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;13	The idea of a political alliance of Bosnian Serbs with Belgrade is akin to the confederation that the current peace plan , rejected by the Bosnian Serbs , allows between Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-led government with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;14	The contact group nations also called for an immediate end to all hostilities across Bosnia , especially in the embattled enclave of Bihac , and demanded free passage for U.N. peacekeeping forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;15	In a statement , the contact group nations said the 49 percent of land offered to the Serbs and the 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat alliance under the group 's plan , `` can be adjusted by mutual agreement between the parties . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0496;16	The Bosnian Serbs currently control about 70 percent of the territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;0	Bosnian Serb promised Friday to release hundreds of detained UN peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;1	Canadian officials confirmed the report but said the Canadians were not yet free to move .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;2	UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;3	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;4	Canadian officials confirmed the UN has negotiated the release of the Canadian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;5	`` But the release has not been effected , '' John Williston , press secretary to Defense Minister David Collenette , said in Ottawa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;6	`` That may happen in the next 24 to 48 hours . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;7	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;8	In Paris , Peter Donolo , a spokesman for Prime Minister Jean Chretien , said : `` Obviously we 're encouraged by the developments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;9	We 're keeping our fingers crossed , but we 're not going to rest until our troops have full freedom of movement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;10	We 've been let down before . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;11	The Serbs have been holding about 400 UN soldiers as insurance against NATO airstrikes on their siege of the Muslim pocket of Bihac , a UN-declared safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;12	The Serbs released 70 Dutch peacekeepers taken hostage Saturday near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;13	The soldiers were in good condition , Dutch officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;14	The Canadians have been held for the past 10 days at various sites in Serb-held territory near their peacekeeping camp in Visoko , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;15	About 20 are at a police complex in the village of Illijas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;16	The rest are at checkpoints and observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;17	The soldiers are in radio contact with their camp and those at observation posts carry on their work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;18	Maj. Dean Milner , the senior officer among the detainees , is able to drive around in his vehicle and visit his soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;19	The Serbs are allowing supply vehicles from camp to reach the soldiers with mail , food and other items .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;20	Akashi , the top UN civilian leader in Bosnia set out Friday to hold talks with the Bosnian government in Sarajevo and with Serb leader Karadzic in Pale .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;21	His mission started badly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0497;22	Three missiles hit the Bosnian government building shortly before he arrived .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official denied Friday that the alliance had abandoned its enforcement of the U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said , amid continued confusion between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over how to deal with the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;2	Earlier Friday , Wing Commander Timothy Hewlet , U.N. director for air operations in Bosnia , told reporters in Sarajevo that Bosnian Serbs had activated several surface-to-air missile sites throughout the country , threatening humanitarian flights and NATO jets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;3	Hewlet said NATO had agreed to a `` cooling off '' period to calm tensions , but was able to `` control '' the situation with AWACs planes flying outside Bosnian air space .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;4	`` There are no flights over Bosnia at the moment that I am aware of , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;5	At NATO headquarters , Secretary-General Willy Claes said he was unaware of any request from the United Nations to halt or scale-down Allied patrols enforcing of the military flight ban , designed to protect Bosnian civilians from bombardment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;6	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;7	However , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in former Yugoslavia , acknowledged talks on the issue were underway .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;8	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;9	`` But I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;10	NATO and the United Nations have repeatedly talked of the need to `` show presence '' in the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;11	But NATO sources in Brussels said Allied planes had been fired on nine times in recent days by Serb missiles and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;12	Under current rules of engagement , NATO planes can strike back if targeted without prior approval from the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;13	Akashi cautioned that NATO air action could threaten delicate negotiations to revive flagging peace efforts and lead to an escalation of fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;14	`` One miscalculation , one misunderstanding and it might become beyond our control , '' he told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;15	Christopher told reporters Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;16	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them , `` and we continue to police the ` no-fly ' zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;17	In Washington however , a senior U.S. military officer acknowledged that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to aircraft .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;18	He would not elaborate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;19	On Tuesday , officials said the United Nations requested and NATO agreed that planes would not fly over Bosnia for a 48-hour period while U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other peace negotiators visited Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;20	Western military sources said it appeared that request was extended slightly , and it was not clear if NATO planes were back in Bosnian airspace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0498;21	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , speaking in Pale after his meeting with Akashi , said , `` We would like to see skies clear of ... NATO aircraft . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;0	Cash registers jingled this week in St. Thomas as 200 sailors from the USS Gallery enjoyed shore leave in the Navy 's first visit in 13 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;1	`` We did an extra $ 5,000 to $ 8,000 during the four days they were here , '' said Guy Revelle , owner of Fat Tuesday 's , a downtown Charlotte Amalie bar and restaurant .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;2	John Chamber of Commerce director Joseph Aubain said it was too soon to total up what the sailors spent Sunday through Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;3	Earlier estimates indicated the territory lost $ 15 million a year in revenue when the Navy stopped its visits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;4	The Navy canceled all shore leave here last October after the number of assaults against sailors began to escalate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;5	One sailor was killed while making a call from a public telephone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;6	The Navy returned this week for a trial visit following a massive campaign by St. Thomas government officials and business people to reduce violent crimes on the island .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;7	Revelle of Fat Tuesday 's said the sailors were well behaved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;8	`` There were zero incidents '' during the shore leave , said Lt. Cmdr. Ed Barker , spokesman for Fleet Air Caribbean at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;9	During the visit , Adm. William J. Flannagan Jr. , commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet , toured downtown Charlotte Amalie to see what measures the government had taken to ensure the sailors ' safety .
APW_ENG_19941202.0499;10	`` It looks extremely promising for another visit , '' Barker said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;0	The jury in the Hollywood Madam case Friday convicted Heidi Fleiss of running a high-priced prostitution ring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;1	In a case that drew the attention of the country , the 28-year-old pediatrician 's daughter was found guilty on three of five pandering charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;2	The seven-man , five-woman jury deadlocked on the two other counts and acquitted her of supplying cocaine to an undercover police officer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;3	The verdict came after four days of deliberations during which the jurors were asked to decide whose conduct was more objectionable , that of Fleiss or that of the undercover officers who the defense claimed had entrapped her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;4	Fleiss was arrested after providing dlrs 1,500 prostitutes for officers posing as businessmen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;5	After the scandal broke last year , there was speculation that Fleiss ' alleged clients included Hollywood stars and moguls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0500;6	But her so-called black book was never made public ; the judge ruled the names of her customers were irrelevant .

APW_ENG_19941202.0503;0	Liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have taken a new settlement plan for the failed bank to a Luxembourg court , court officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;1	Judge Maryse Welter is to rule Jan. 12 on the plan to repay 250,000 creditors and depositors around the world some dlrs 10 billion , said court registrar Maryse Schumacher .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;2	A creditors ' committee approved the plan in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;3	It would provide dlrs 1.8 billion from the bank 's majority shareholders , the government and ruling family of Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;4	Liquidators say the plan could repay creditors 30 to 40 cents on the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;5	But many depositors worry their savings have disappeared in legal costs during the four years it has taken to wind up the bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;6	An earlier settlement plan for BCCI depositors was shot down by a Luxembourg judge last year as too favorable to Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;7	Abu Dhabi was to have paid dlrs 1.7 billion into a fund for creditors in the earlier deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;8	The new deal increases the amount of money and changes the wording to accommodate what technical objections raised by the judges last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;9	Schumacher said no creditors opposed the plan during two days of court hearings Wednesday and Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;10	But a lawyer for Luxembourg 's banking supervisors , the Luxembourg Monetary Institute , argued against what it considers is still too easy a deal for Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;11	Banking regulators closed BCCI branches around the world in July 1991 , leaving claims of about dlrs 10 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0503;12	Officials alleged BCCI was used to launder money for drug dealers and dictators around the globe , but some of the depositors who lost their money blame the troubles on lax regulation by the authorities , including the Bank of England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;0	The standoff between the U.S. PGA Tour and the new World Golf Tour has turned into a contest of credibility with both sides claiming a victory of sorts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;1	The World Golf Tour on Friday issued a statement saying it was `` continuing to move ahead as planned '' with its venture to stage six to eight tournaments in 1995 , some of which would conflict with PGA Tour events .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;2	The statement also said that Greg Norman 's commitment to the World Golf Tour `` is as firm as ever . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;3	This all came one day after PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem released a statement in which he said Norman told him he had had a `` re-evaluation of this situation '' and had told Finchem `` he would not support any venture that would damage the PGA Tour . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;4	Norman , who joined World Golf Tour executive director John Montgomery Jr. and Fox Television in announcing the new tour two weeks ago , has wavered in his support of the venture since Finchem announced that he would suspend any PGA Tour member who played in events that conflict with the tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;5	No American professionals have committed to the world tour , and no dates , sites or sponsors have been announced for the tournaments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;6	`` They are very keen to keep communications open , '' Norman , who is in Australia , said about the PGA Tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;7	`` He -LRB- Finchem -RRB- asked me to see him when I get home , and I will do that .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;8	Right now , the World Tour and the PGA Tour have a chance of working this thing out . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;9	Norman is scheduled to meet with Finchem and Montgomery separately when he returns to the United States next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;10	Fox Sports spokesman Vince Wladika said the network was still interested in broadcasting the tournaments if the world tour went forward as planned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;11	As proposed , the new tour would have a 40-man field , based on the world rankings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0504;12	The prize money would provide dlrs 1 million for player of the year ; dlrs 600,000 to each tournament winner , and dlrs 30,000 to the last-place finisher , as well as dlrs 50,000 to each golfer for expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;0	Earlier Friday , Akashi met with Bosnian government officials in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;1	Minutes before he arrived for those talks , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building where the meeting was to occur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;2	Three more missiles hit nearby buildings during the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;3	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;4	U.N. officials said it appeared to be Serb fire ; the Serbs later accused the Bosnians of attacking themselves to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;5	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' while the United Nations failed to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , a U.N. `` safe area . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;6	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;7	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , referring to European capitulation to Adolf Hitler before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;8	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group and now ambassador to Germany , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on new efforts to reach a peace settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;9	Those new efforts , unveiled Friday night in Brussels by the five-nation Contact Group , include allowing Bosnian Serbs to have some form of political ties to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they had long sought .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;10	Critics of that new plan said it amounted to appeasement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;11	But Karadzic suggested even that might not now be enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;12	He said the Bosnians Serbs must first be guaranteed sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;13	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;14	... We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;15	In a letter to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , carried by his news service SRNA , Karadzic warned the United Nations to drop its `` illusion that Bosnia exists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;16	... This illusion has cost us hundreds of thousands of human lives . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;17	Akashi also discussed a possible cease-fire for Bihac and beyond .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;18	But the Serbs maintained their rejection of a temporary cease-fire , saying they would accept only an end to the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;19	The Bosnian government fears that would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;20	U.N. officials said fighting continued Friday around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;21	But the heaviest action was around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;22	The Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;23	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;24	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;25	Those allied forces took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;26	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;27	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0505;28	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out , saying , `` otherwise we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;0	Quotes on the prospects of a sudden UN withdrawal from the former Yugoslavia :
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;1	`` Even without winter it 's grim .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;2	The winter brings the fogs and mist , terrible weather , clouds all the time and you ca n't get the aircraft in there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;3	Most of the aircraft available ca n't operate at night , so what do you do when the sun goes down ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;4	-- Jim Dunnigan , New York military analyst on the problems of trying to secure air cover for a retreat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;5	`` Europe and NATO in general have always had thousands of helicopters , but they make beautiful targets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;6	They 're nice and slow , they make a lot of noise . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;7	-- Dunnigan on using helicopters to evacuate peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;8	`` The equipment and other gear that they 've amassed ... you conceivably would have to destroy tonnes of it because you do n't want anybody to lay their hands on that gear . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;9	-- Martin Shadwick of York University commenting on keeping UN equipment out of the hands of warring factions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;10	`` There 's no way you should be contemplating pulling out until it 's an absolute necessity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;11	No matter how well you have planned it , it 's going to be a vary messy business . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;12	-- Retired colonel Sean Henry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;13	`` If any of the three sides do n't want you to leave then you do n't leave .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;14	They wo n't use artillery and they wo n't use blowing the roads .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;15	They 'll use women and children .
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;16	It 's the most effective way to keep the UN . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0506;17	-- Lew MacKenzie , retired major-general .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia Friday sought to restart the drive for a peace deal in Bosnia by endorsing , for the first time , a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations met after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;2	`` The road will be very difficult , '' Christopher told reporters after the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;3	`` But we do not see any other responsible road to take other than to redouble our efforts '' to find a political settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;4	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said it was agreed `` to devise a constitutional arrangement '' enabling Bosnian Serbs to link up politically with Belgrade without somehow undermining Bosnia 's sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;5	Such an alliance has been a key aim of Serbs throughout the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;6	The endorsement of it is bound to be seen as acquiescing in a `` Greater Serbia '' which has so far been resisted by the Contact Group members .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;7	The immediate reaction to the latest peace plan version from Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was not encouranging .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;8	He asked for international recognition of the Bosnian Serb sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;9	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;10	Then we can stay in association with Muslims , Croats , Serbia etc , '' Karadzic said at his headquarters in Pale , Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;11	`` We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;12	Juppe and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd are to visit the Serbian capital of Belgrade Sunday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;13	`` We shall keep trying '' to find a negotiated settlement , Juppe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;14	Christopher said the core of a Bosnian peace plan remained a strict territorial division giving Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;15	`` The Contact Group plan with its 51-49 division of territory , must be the basis of a settlement of the conflict , '' Christopher said
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;16	Hurd said the alternative to a negotiated settlement that provides for some form of Serb confederation is `` more dangerous , even disastrous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;17	The idea of a political alliance of Bosnian Serbs with Belgrade is akin to the confederation that the current peace plan -- rejected by the Bosnian Serbs -- allows between Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-led government with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;18	The contact group nations also called for an immediate end to all hostilities across Bosnia , especially in the embattled enclave of Bihac , and demanded free passage for U.N. peacekeeping forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;19	In a statement , the contact group nations said the 49 percent of land offered to the Serbs and the 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat alliance under the group 's plan , `` can be adjusted by mutual agreement between the parties . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;20	The statement said both the Bosnian Serbs and the Croat-Muslim group should be allowed `` equitable and balanced arrangements . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0507;21	The Bosnian Serbs currently control some 70 percent of the territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;0	An anti-abortion activist who killed a doctor and his escort in a shotgun attack was sentenced by a federal judge on Friday to life in prison .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;1	The judge sentenced Paul Hill to two life terms for violating the new federal clinic protection law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;2	Next week , a judge will decide whether Hill should get the electric chair on state murder charges in the slayings .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;3	Hill , 40 , of Pensacola was the first person in the nation prosecuted under the federal law against using violence or otherwise interfering with those entering abortion clinics .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;4	The life-without-parole sentences will run concurrently .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;5	Hill , a former Presbyterian minister , killed Dr. John Bayard Britton , 69 , and his volunteer bodyguard , retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett , 74 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;6	Barrett 's wife , 69-year-old June Barrett , was wounded in the attack July 29 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;7	`` The rationale , your honor , is simply I was trying to prevent Dr. Britton from killing the 30 people he was going to kill that day , '' Hill told U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;8	Vinson said he did not doubt Hill 's sincerity about believing he had a higher motive , but added : `` God does not look with favor on the taking of any human life . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;9	The sentence `` shows that extreme anti-abortion zealots are not above the law and will be punished to the full measure of the law , '' Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation , said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;10	Hill also received 10 years under the new law for shooting Mrs. Barrett and five years for a weapons violation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;11	He was ordered to pay Mrs. Barrett $ 480 for medical expenses and counseling and $ 1,815 for her husband 's funeral expenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;12	Hill acted as his own lawyer at both trials but offered no defense after the two judges refused to let him argue that the slayings were a justifiable attempt to save lives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;13	The state jury that convicted Hill a month ago recommended the death penalty , but Circuit Judge Frank Bell is not bound by the recommendation at sentencing on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;14	Assistant U.S. Attorney David McGee said a key purpose of the dual prosecution in state and federal court was to let people know federal resources will be brought to bear against those who commit anti-abortion violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;15	`` History teaches few lessons as clearly as the dangers inherent in those who kill in the name of God , '' McGee said after Hill 's sentencing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;16	`` Paul Hill is one of those men .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;17	He commits coldblooded murder and invokes the name of God to defend his acts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;18	It 's sacrilege . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;19	Barrett 's son , Bruce Barrett of Pensacola , attended the hearing and praised the sentence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;20	`` That 's the way the law goes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0508;21	That 's what my father died for -- the law , the Constitution , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of detained UN peacekeepers , but there was no confirmation that Canadians were free to move .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;1	Defense Minister David Collenette said in Ottawa that Canadian officers in the former Yugoslavia could n't confirm the reports of agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;2	UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;3	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;4	`` We have no confirmed reports concerning Canadian detainess , '' Collenette said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;5	`` You ca n't be definitive until you know what is happening . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;6	He said Canadian military officers are monitoring the negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;7	`` We had understood that negotiations were becoming more hopeful and fruitful , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0509;8	`` You 're dealing with a conflict where there are a lot of turns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;0	National Hockey League labor talks ended abruptly Friday , even though a collective bargaining agreement probably needs to be in place by mid-December to save the season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;1	`` You 're saying we have two more weeks , but I 'm not quite sure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;2	And even if we did , it goes by awfully quickly , '' said Cliff Fletcher , the Toronto Maple Leafs ' general manager .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;3	`` It 's like driving a car 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- an hour , racing toward a cliff .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;4	You 'd better make sure you know how to put the brakes on in time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;5	So far , the sides only know how to put the brakes on negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;6	The latest delay guarantees that the owners ' lockout will carry into a 10th week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;7	An eight-hour meeting Thursday had produced hope that an accord could be reached in time to salvage a 50-game season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;8	But the sides met for only an hour Friday before agreeing to postpone talks until Monday in Chicago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;9	`` What you hope will happen after a break like this is that people come back to the table with new ideas or new concepts or new proposals and the thing moves forward quickly , '' NHL senior vice president Brian Burke said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;10	`` But the calendar is coming toward us like a freight train .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;11	At some point , it 's not going to be possible to have a season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;12	Hopefully , that 's going to add some pressure to the talks from both sides . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;13	The players , however , insist they 've been operating with a sense of urgency and say they 've been making all the concessions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;14	`` It is getting a little tiresome in the sense that this has been characterized so far as a negotiation of concession , '' NHL Players Association president Mike Gartner said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;15	`` That 's what happens , I guess , in a lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;16	I guess if we would have given enough , there would be hockey right now . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;17	The latest union concessions came Thursday , when the NHLPA agreed to allow each team to designate a `` franchise player '' who could be kept from becoming a free agent if he is paid a certain salary .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;18	Gartner and union head Bob Goodenow contacted several potential franchise players , including some who are skating for the all-star team Wayne Gretzky has assembled to play in Europe during the lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;19	`` Their reaction was that they were n't too happy about it , '' Gartner said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;20	`` But they did say , ` If this is going to get a deal , we understand . ' ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;21	The union on Thursday also agreed to drop its desired salary ceiling for first-round draft picks from dlrs 1.5 million to dlrs 1.25 million , but the owners refused to budge from their dlrs 700,000 figure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;22	The main sticking points in negotiations continued to be salary arbitration , free agency and other ways the owners can fix costs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;23	`` We have a situation where revenues have been greatly outstripped by the increase in salaries , '' said NHL commissioner Gary Bettman , the front man in negotiations for the owners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;24	For now , the sides are n't discussing the owners ' contentious salary tax proposal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;25	Players consider it a form of salary cap and say they wo n't agree to it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;26	Each team already has had 24 games canceled from its 84-game schedule because of the lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;27	More cuts are likely .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;28	Bettman , who said he was `` getting a little frustrated , '' agreed that time has become a major factor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;29	`` And the longer this goes on , the more of a factor time becomes , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;30	`` I hope both sides are cognizant of what the downside of this is .
APW_ENG_19941202.0510;31	I told the owners early on when they decided to go down this road that one of the possibilities they had to prepare for was the possibility of no season . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;0	The American dollar surged against the Japanese yen Friday , closing above the key 100-yen level for the first time in seven weeks , in a move that many analysts said signaled the U.S. currency 's long-awaited recovery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;1	Data released in Tokyo and Washington pointed to changes in economic fundamentals that according to currency market participants should shift the global flow of capital back toward U.S. assets and drive up demand for the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;2	`` We 're seeing a fundamental reappraisal of the dollar , '' said Robert Brusca , chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co.
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;3	International Inc. `` It 's turned a pretty important corner . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;4	In late New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 100.61 yen , up from 99.34 late Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;5	It was the currency 's first close above 100 yen since Oct. 11 and the highest since Oct. 7 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;6	In London , the dollar rose to 100.36 yen from 99.35 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;7	In Tokyo , where the trading day begins , the U.S. currency finished the week at 99.58 yen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;8	The dollar also surged to a three-month high against the German mark and advanced vs. most other major currencies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;9	But dealers said trading centered on the yen , which weakened broadly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;10	The dollar rose in Asian dealings after the Japanese government reported the country 's trade surplus fell sharply in October , the third-consecutive monthly decline , while the economy grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the third quarter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;11	Those numbers suggested a reduction of the huge stockpiles of dollars Japan earns by exporting goods to the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;12	Constant selling of dollars for yen by Japanese companies had helped to push the U.S. currency to record lows this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;13	In addition , a strong Japanese economy should absorb more imports , which must be paid for in foreign currencies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;14	`` Some of the reasons for the stronger yen may no longer be as valid , '' said Ezra Zask , president of Norfolk , Conn.-based money-management firm Ezra Zask Associates Inc.
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;15	The dollar was further bolstered in European and American trading by a stronger-than-expected report on U.S. employment in November .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;16	The Labor Department said the economy created 350,000 jobs last month , pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 5.6 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;17	That combined with other recent evidence of economic strength increases the liklihood that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates again , perhaps as soon as this month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;18	The central bank has boosted rates six times this year in an effort to head off inflation , which reduces the value of many investments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;19	Receding inflation fears and the higher returns offered on shorter-term U.S. investments vs. those in Europe and Japan are providing a powerful draw , particularly at a time when Tokyo stock prices seem to have peaked .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;20	`` There is a realization in the foreign exchange market of a shifting out of yen-denominated assets and into dollar assets , '' said Bob Near , a vice president at the Bank of New York .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;21	Brusca added that the Japanese had been hesitant this year to buy into American financial markets for fear that their investments would decline in value as the dollar dropped .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;22	That 's likely to change now that the dollar has breached 100 yen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;23	`` A dollar below 100 yen reflected a currency that was too weak and deterred people from bringing money into the country , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;24	The stronger dollar `` inspires more confidence from investors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;25	The United States now stands a better chance of attracting Japanese capital . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;26	The dollar was changing hands late in New York at 1.5802 marks -- the best finish against that currency since Aug. 31 -- up from 1.5733 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;27	In London , the dollar advanced to 1.5763 marks from 1.5743 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;28	Other late dollar rates in New York , compared with late Thursday : 1.3338 Swiss francs , up from 1.3295 ; 5.4190 French francs , up from 5.3915 ; 1,618 Italian lire , up from 1,614 ; and 1.3712 Canadian dollars , down from 1.3776 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;29	The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.5603 , down from dlrs 1.5669 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0511;30	In London , the pound dropped to dlrs 1.5605 from dlrs 1.5655 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;0	Lacking a witness to testify billions of dollars in Japanese bonds are really fakes , federal prosecutors dropped charges against two St. Petersburg men and a South Korean .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;1	The three were accused of trying to parlay dlrs 4.1 billion worth of purportedly counterfeit Japanese government bonds into multimillion-dollar lines of credit at four Tampa Bay-area financial institutions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;2	Charges of bank and wire fraud , conspiracy and counterfeiting were dropped Thursday after a federal judge denied the government 's request to delay the trial until a witness could be brought from Japan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;3	U.S. District Judge H. Dale Cook said he would decide early next year whether the government can refile the charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;4	Prosecutors had hoped Cook would allow the witness , a Japanese government official , to testify via a videocassette tape made when he was in town to testify in another case in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;5	But the tape ran out after two hours of testimony and defense attorneys never got a chance to cross-examine the witness .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;6	The witness , Hideo Inoue of the Japanese Ministry of Finance , then announced he would be leaving for Japan the next day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;7	`` It was a hoot , '' defense attorney John Swisher said Thursday of the abortive taping session .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;8	Swisher said prosecutors searched for a fresh tape and came up empty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;9	Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Page said Inoue apparently did not enjoy testifying in court -- and then coming under hours of cross-examination -- during a similar bond case earlier the day of the taping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;10	Inoue testified in the trial of former Assistant U.S. Attorney General Norbert Schlei and three others .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;11	The group was charged with attempting to sell up to dlrs 16 billion in forged Japanese bonds .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;12	Inoue 's testimony is key to both cases because without him prosecutors have no Japanese government witness to say the bonds are fake .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;13	The bonds in the two cases are nearly identical , but the cases share no other connection .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;14	Page said the government hopes to refile charges against William Woo Am Choi , 59 , of St. Petersburg ; his son Samuel Choi , 25 ; and Joung Joon An , 56 , of South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;15	Joung and William Choi were to be released after the charges were dropped .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;16	Samuel Choi already was free on bail .
APW_ENG_19941202.0513;17	The trial of Schlei and the three others continues next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia on Friday sought to restart the drive for a peace deal in Bosnia by endorsing a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;1	The foreign ministers of the Bosnia ` Contact Group ' nations met after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsed the European view that diplomacy is the best way to deal with the conflict that has dragged on for 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;2	`` The road will be very difficult , '' Christopher told reporters after the meeting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;3	`` But we do not see any other responsible road to take other than to redouble our efforts '' to find a political settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;4	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said it was agreed `` to devise a constitutional arrangement '' enabling Bosnian Serbs to link up politically with Belgrade without undermining Bosnia 's sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;5	Such an alliance has been a key aim of Serbs throughout the Bosnian crisis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;6	The endorsement of it is bound to be seen as acquiescing in a `` Greater Serbia '' which has so far been resisted by the Contact Group members .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;7	The immediate reaction to the latest peace plan version from Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was not encouraging .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;8	He asked for international recognition of the Bosnian Serb sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;9	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;10	Then we can stay in association with Muslims , Croats , Serbia etc , '' Karadzic said at his headquarters in Pale , Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;11	`` We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;12	Juppe and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd are to visit the Serbian capital of Belgrade Sunday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;13	`` We shall keep trying '' to find a negotiated settlement , Juppe said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;14	Christopher said the core of a Bosnian peace plan remained a strict territorial division giving Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;15	`` The Contact Group plan with its 51-49 division of territory , must be the basis of a settlement of the conflict , '' Christopher said
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;16	Hurd said the alternative to a negotiated settlement that provides for some form of Serb confederation is `` more dangerous , even disastrous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;17	The idea of a political alliance of Bosnian Serbs with Belgrade is akin to the confederation that the current peace plan , rejected by the Bosnian Serbs , allows between Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-led government with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;18	The contact group nations also called for an immediate end to all hostilities across Bosnia , especially in the embattled enclave of Bihac , and demanded free passage for U.N. peacekeeping forces .
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;19	In a statement , the contact group nations said the 49 percent of land offered to the Serbs and the 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat alliance under the group 's plan , `` can be adjusted by mutual agreement between the parties . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0515;20	The Bosnian Serbs currently control about 70 percent of the territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;0	World Boxing Association cruiserweight champion Anaclet Wamba of France will defend his crown Saturday against Marcelo Dominguez of Argentina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;1	The bout , Wamba 's seventh defense , was scheduled for 6:10 p.m. -LRB- 2110 GMT -RRB- in Salta , a provincial capital 1,010 miles -LRB- 1,625 kilometers -RRB- northwest of Buenos Aires .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;2	Wamba , 32 , has a record of 44-1-2 with 22 knockouts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;3	Dominguez 's record stands at 14-0-1 with seven knockouts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;4	The referee is Vinnie Delgado of the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0516;5	Judges are Roberto Barrovecchio of Italy , Micky Hanny of Britain and Harry Croes of Aruba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;0	No one is quite sure how long the man sat in the patio chair in his darkened basement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;1	When a gas meter reader finally found him Thursday , he was still comfortably dressed in a woolly blue and white sweater , sweatpants and slippers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;2	Except that his head was missing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;3	The seated , skeletal remains were so decomposed that the skull had apparently toppled away , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;4	Authorities tentatively identified the body Friday as Long Lu Lee , 69 , a mechanical engineer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;5	When Lee died -- and how -- remained a mystery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;6	A woman who investigators believe was Lee 's wife , Thuc Khoanh Lu , 62 , was providing few answers , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;7	Lu told police she had not seen her husband for several months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;8	But police could not find a missing-person report , said Sgt. Edward Caro , a police spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;9	The results of an autopsy Friday were inconclusive and doctors will conduct more tests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;10	Brooklyn Union Gas Co. had been trying , unsuccessfully , to read the meter at the home in the New York borough of Queens for more than a year , said spokesman Ed Yutkowitz .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;11	Armed with a court order , a meter reader went to the home along with a city marshal and a locksmith .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;12	Lu tried to discourage them from going into the basement , Caro said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;13	They pushed their way through a huge , sticky cobweb and found the headless skeleton sitting in the white plastic chair near a boiler , Caro said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0517;14	Lee 's wallet was found in a pants pocket , his head under the chair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;0	The government agreed Friday to drop its case against General Motors pickup trucks , accepting a deal in which GM will spend more than dlrs 51 million on safety and research programs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;1	Transportation Secretary Federico Pena announced the agreement at a news conference in Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;2	He said the idea behind the deal is that the safety and research programs GM will finance will begin saving lives immediately .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;3	`` Proceeding with the recall process would have taken years in court , '' Pena said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;4	`` During all that time , the trucks subject to this investigation would have remained on our highways . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;5	He described the agreement as `` a common sense outcome and a victory for safety and saving lives . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;6	GM released a statement describing the company 's agreement to collaborate with the government on safety programs as `` clearly in the public interest . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;7	Pena announced Oct. 17 that he had determined the trucks present an unreasonable risk of fire in side-impact collisions because their fuel tanks are mounted outside the vehicle frame .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;8	He scheduled a public meeting , set for Tuesday in Washington , to gather more information on whether he should order a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;9	The deal cancels the meeting , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Transportation Department will not proceed with further steps toward a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;10	About 9 million of the trucks were built between model years 1973 and 1987 and sold under Chevrolet and GMC nameplates .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;11	GM estimates about 5 million still are in use .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;12	The agreement also calls for the Department of Transportation to add dlrs 27 million to the dlrs 51 million GM is putting into the program .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;13	`` Our position has never wavered that these trucks are not unsafe and do not pose an unreasonable risk to owners who continue to operate them , '' the GM statement said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;14	NHTSA began investigating the trucks two years ago after consumer groups petitioned for a recall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;15	The agency asked GM to voluntarily recall the trucks in 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;16	Pena acknowledged in October that the trucks meet federal crash safety standards , but he said the law requires that they be safe in real-world conditions as well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;17	GM filed suit last month seeking to block any further action by him in the case .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;18	Pena said that case would be dismissed as part of the settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;19	In February 1993 , a jury in Atlanta found General Motors negligent in the death of a teen-ager in a fiery crash involving a GM pickup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;20	The jury awarded the parents of 17-year-old Shannon Mosley , who died in a crash in 1989 , dlrs 105 million in damages .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;21	The verdict and the damage award were later thrown out by a state appeals court and a retrial is pending .
APW_ENG_19941202.0518;22	The appeals court said the jury should not have been told about other suits pending against GM .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of certain U.N. convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;1	Earlier Friday , the Serbs once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency building minutes before Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy for the former Yugoslavia , arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;2	Akashi later met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;3	After the meeting , Akashi told reporters he had been assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British resupply convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;4	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians ... and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;5	Serbs detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia as insurance against further NATO airstrikes after alliance planes struck Serb targets three times last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;6	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers , detained a week ago with a convoy bound for the eastern enclave of Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;7	The Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;8	Akashi also said the Serbs promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;9	`` I am very pleased to find willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;10	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;11	Karadzic promised normalized relations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;12	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said , without elaborating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;13	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;14	Karadzic also issued a veiled warning against NATO warplanes enforcing a U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;15	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircrafts and of NATO aircrafts , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;16	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;17	NATO sources said allied planes had been fired on by Serb missiles nine times in recent days and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;18	Earlier Friday , Akashi met with Bosnian government officials in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;19	Minutes before he arrived for those talks , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building where the meeting was to occur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;20	Three more missiles hit nearby buildings during the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;21	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;22	U.N. officials said it appeared to be Serb fire ; the Serbs later accused the Bosnians of attacking themselves to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;23	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and criticized the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , a U.N.-designated `` safe area . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;24	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;25	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;26	He was referring to the European appeasement of Adolf Hitler at the 1938 Munich meeting before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;27	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group and now ambassador to Germany , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on new efforts to reach a peace settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;28	Those new efforts , unveiled Friday night in Brussels by the five-nation Contact Group , include allowing Bosnian Serbs to have some form of political ties to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they had long sought .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;29	Critics of that new plan said it amounted to appeasement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;30	But Karadzic suggested even that might not now be enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;31	He said the Bosnians Serbs must first be guaranteed sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;32	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;33	... We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;34	In a letter to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , carried by his news service SRNA , Karadzic warned the United Nations to drop its `` illusion that Bosnia exists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;35	... This illusion has cost us hundreds of thousands of human lives . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;36	Akashi also discussed a possible cease-fire for Bihac and beyond .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;37	But the Serbs maintained their rejection of a temporary cease-fire , saying they would accept only an end to the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;38	The Bosnian government fears that would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;39	U.N. officials said fighting continued Friday around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;40	But the heaviest action was around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;41	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;42	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;43	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;44	Those allied forces took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;45	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;46	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0519;47	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out , saying , `` otherwise we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0520;0	The United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia Friday sought to restart the drive for a peace deal in Bosnia by endorsing , for the first time , a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0524;1	Earlier Friday , the Serbs once again made clear their contempt for the U.N. mission , firing anti-armor missiles at the Bosnian presidency building minutes before Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy for the former Yugoslavia , arrived there for talks with government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;2	Akashi later met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;3	After the meeting , Akashi told reporters he had been assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British resupply convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;4	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians ... and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;5	Serbs detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia as insurance against further NATO airstrikes after alliance planes struck Serb targets three times last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;6	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers , detained a week ago with a convoy bound for the eastern enclave of Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;7	The Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;8	Akashi also said the Serbs promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;9	`` I am very pleased to find willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;10	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;11	Karadzic promised normalized relations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;12	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said , without elaborating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;13	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;14	Karadzic also issued a veiled warning against NATO warplanes enforcing a U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;15	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircrafts and of NATO aircrafts , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;16	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;17	NATO sources said allied planes had been fired on by Serb missiles nine times in recent days and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;18	Earlier Friday , Akashi met with Bosnian government officials in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;19	Minutes before he arrived for those talks , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building where the meeting was to occur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;20	Three more missiles hit nearby buildings during the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;21	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;22	U.N. officials said it appeared to be Serb fire ; the Serbs later accused the Bosnians of attacking themselves to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;23	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and criticized the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , a U.N.-designated `` safe area . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;24	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;25	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;26	He was referring to the European appeasement of Adolf Hitler at the 1938 Munich meeting before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;27	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group and now ambassador to Germany , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on new efforts to reach a peace settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;28	Those new efforts , unveiled Friday night in Brussels by the five-nation Contact Group , include allowing Bosnian Serbs to have some form of political ties to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they had long sought .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;29	Critics of that new plan said it amounted to appeasement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;30	But Karadzic suggested even that might not now be enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;31	He said the Bosnians Serbs must first be guaranteed sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;32	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;33	... We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;34	In a letter to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , carried by his news service SRNA , Karadzic warned the United Nations to drop its `` illusion that Bosnia exists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;35	... This illusion has cost us hundreds of thousands of human lives . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;36	Akashi also discussed a possible cease-fire for Bihac and beyond .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;37	But the Serbs maintained their rejection of a temporary cease-fire , saying they would accept only an end to the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;38	The Bosnian government fears that would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;39	U.N. officials said fighting continued Friday around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;40	But the heaviest action was around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;41	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;42	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;43	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;44	Those allied forces took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;45	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;46	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0524;47	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out , saying , `` otherwise we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;0	National Hockey League labor talks ended abruptly Friday , even though a collective bargaining agreement probably needs to be in place by mid-December to save the season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;1	`` You 're saying we have two more weeks , but I 'm not quite sure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;2	And even if we did , it goes by awfully quickly , '' said Cliff Fletcher , the Toronto Maple Leafs ' general manager .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;3	`` It 's like driving a car 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- an hour , racing toward a cliff .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;4	You 'd better make sure you know how to put the brakes on in time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;5	So far , the sides only know how to put the brakes on negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;6	The latest delay guarantees that the owners ' lockout will carry into a 10th week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;7	An eight-hour meeting Thursday had produced hope that an accord could be reached in time to salvage a 50-game season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;8	But the sides met for only an hour Friday before agreeing to postpone talks until Monday in Chicago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;9	`` What you hope will happen after a break like this is that people come back to the table with new ideas or new concepts or new proposals and the thing moves forward quickly , '' NHL senior vice president Brian Burke said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;10	`` But the calendar is coming toward us like a freight train .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;11	At some point , it 's not going to be possible to have a season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;12	Hopefully , that 's going to add some pressure to the talks from both sides . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;13	The players , however , insist they 've been operating with a sense of urgency and say they 've been making all the concessions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;14	`` It is getting a little tiresome in the sense that this has been characterized so far as a negotiation of concession , '' NHL Players Association president Mike Gartner said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;15	`` That 's what happens , I guess , in a lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;16	I guess if we would have given enough , there would be hockey right now . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;17	The latest union concessions came Thursday , when the NHLPA agreed to allow each team to designate a `` franchise player '' who could be kept from becoming a free agent if he is paid a certain salary .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;18	Gartner and union head Bob Goodenow contacted several potential franchise players , including some who are skating for the all-star team Wayne Gretzky has assembled to play in Europe during the lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;19	`` Their reaction was that they were n't too happy about it , '' Gartner said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;20	`` But they did say , ` If this is going to get a deal , we understand . ' ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;21	The union on Thursday also agreed to drop its desired salary ceiling for first-round draft picks from dlrs 1.5 million to dlrs 1.25 million , but the owners refused to budge from their dlrs 700,000 figure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;22	The main sticking points in negotiations continued to be salary arbitration , free agency and other ways the owners can fix costs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;23	`` We have a situation where revenues have been greatly outstripped by the increase in salaries , '' said NHL commissioner Gary Bettman , the front man in negotiations for the owners .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;24	For now , the sides are n't discussing the owners ' contentious salary tax proposal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;25	Players consider it a form of salary cap and say they wo n't agree to it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;26	Each team already has had 24 games canceled from its 84-game schedule because of the lockout .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;27	More cuts are likely .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;28	Bettman , who said he was `` getting a little frustrated , '' agreed that time has become a major factor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;29	`` And the longer this goes on , the more of a factor time becomes , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;30	`` I hope both sides are cognizant of what the downside of this is .
APW_ENG_19941202.0526;31	I told the owners early on when they decided to go down this road that one of the possibilities they had to prepare for was the possibility of no season . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;0	An express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday and slammed into a station building , killing at least 21 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;1	At least 60 people were injured , said National Police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;2	The accident occurred at Szajol , about 40 miles southeast of the Hungarian capital , when the second car of an express train derailed and dragged three other cars off the tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;3	The overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;4	`` There was a tremendous explosion , like the end of the world , '' a railway employee who witnessed the accident said in a telephone interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;5	People were still buried in the wreckage more than four hours after the crash , said the employee , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;6	State television showed pictures of battered and broken railway cars covered in bricks and rescue crews dragging bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;7	The death toll reached 21 by late Friday and was expected to go higher , with temperatures below freezing and some people still trapped in the wreckage , said Garamvoelgyi , the police spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;8	Doctors at a hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said they admitted 26 injured people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;9	Other hospitals also took in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0527;10	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 100 miles east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;0	Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard had his left leg amputated after being attacked by a strain of flesh-eating bacteria , but is out of danger , doctors said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;1	Bouchard , 55 , the most popular leader in Canada 's largest French-speaking province , vowed to continue his political career , dedicated to making Quebec an independent country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;2	`` Mr. Bouchard has greatly improved over the past 12 hours , '' Dr. Patrick d'Amico told a news conference at Montreal 's St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;3	D'Amico said Bouchard had undergone three operations since being admitted to the hospital earlier this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;4	The left leg was amputated at mid-thigh in an operation during which he was conscious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;5	If no further complications occur , Bouchard should recover fully in about three or four months , said D'Amico .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;6	Earlier Friday , rumors circulated that Bouchard was on the verge of death , but hospital officials dismissed them as untrue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;7	News of Bouchard 's illness shook Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;8	Small groups of people , some bearing Quebec flags , kept an all-night vigil outside the hospital under a light snowfall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;9	Bouchard was struck by a rare disease known as necrotizing myositis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;10	It is similar to necrotizing fasciitis , the `` flesh-eating disease '' that caused alarm in Britain this year , but attacks muscle rather than connective tissue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;11	Dr. Francois Lamothe , a specialist in microbiology who also appeared at the news conference , said the disease is caused by the streptococcus A bacterium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;12	It is fatal in 80 percent of the cases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;13	The bacteria is common and usually results in sore throats or tonsilitis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;14	But in about one in a million cases , it turns deadly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;15	Bouchard , a former Conservative Cabinet minister , bolted former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 's government in 1990 and formed his own party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;16	The new party became , effectively , the national arm of the Parti Quebecois , the provincial party dedicated to the secession of Quebec and its 7 million inhabitants from Canada .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;17	In the 1993 federal elections , the Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats to become the official opposition to the ruling Liberals in the House of Commons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;18	Few wanted to speculate on what the absence of Bouchard would have on the political scene or the referendum on independence expected next year in Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;19	Politicians of all political stripes expressed their concern for Bouchard 's health and wished him well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;20	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , on a trip to France , said : `` I speak not only for the government of Canada , but also for the people of Canada when I express to Mr. Bouchard and his family our deep regrets and our sincere wish for a rapid return of his health . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;21	The disease struck Bouchard suddenly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;22	Last weekend he had attended a party congress , though he complained of having the flu .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;23	On Tuesday , he was diagnose with phlebitis , an inflammation of a vein in his leg , and was admitted to St. Luc Hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0528;24	Dr. Pierre Ghosn , head of cardiovascular surgery , said he operated to relieve pressure in the leg and discovered the disease .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;0	The Energy Ministry announced Friday that 140 national and international companies have applied to bid for the rights to 10 oil fields that need new investment to improve low production .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;1	Wilson Pastor , the ministry 's coordinator for the project , said the 10 fields need dlrs 151 million of additional investment to raise the extractable oil reserves from 47.96 million barrels to 154.26 million barrels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;2	`` We expect to finish the bidding on these fields between June and July 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;3	The winning companies will have concessions for 20 years , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;4	Sixty national companies and consortiums and 80 international companies have qualified to bid , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;5	The lots produce less than 1 percent of the national production of 385,000 barrels of crude a day , and measure between 20,000 and 149,000 acres -LRB- 8,000 to 60,000 hectares -RRB- each , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0529;6	Pastor said that in the first stage of the project the winning companies will have to invest between dlrs 30 million and dlrs 45 million for environmental protection and recovery in the Amazon jungle region where the well are located .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;0	Liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have taken a new settlement plan for the failed bank to a Luxembourg court , court officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;1	Judge Maryse Welter is to rule Jan. 12 on the plan to repay 250,000 creditors and depositors around the world some dlrs 10 billion , said court registrar Maryse Schumacher .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;2	A creditors ' committee approved the plan in September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;3	It would provide dlrs 1.8 billion from the bank 's majority shareholders , the government and ruling family of Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;4	Liquidators say the plan could repay creditors 30 to 40 cents on the dollar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;5	But many depositors worry their savings have disappeared in legal costs during the four years it has taken to wind up the bank .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;6	An earlier settlement plan for BCCI depositors was shot down by a Luxembourg judge last year as too favorable to Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;7	Abu Dhabi was to have paid dlrs 1.7 billion into a fund for creditors in the earlier deal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;8	The new deal increases the amount of money and changes the wording to accommodate what technical objections raised by the judges last year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;9	Schumacher said no creditors opposed the plan during two days of court hearings Wednesday and Thursday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;10	But a lawyer for Luxembourg 's banking supervisors , the Luxembourg Monetary Institute , argued against what it considers is still too easy a deal for Abu Dhabi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;11	Banking regulators closed BCCI branches around the world in July 1991 , leaving claims of about dlrs 10 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0530;12	Officials alleged BCCI was used to launder money for drug dealers and dictators around the globe , but some of the depositors who lost their money blame the troubles on lax regulation by the authorities , including the Bank of England .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;0	Here are excerpts of a statement issued by the Contact Group foreign ministers after their meeting here Friday :
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;1	`` Ministers expressed very deep concern about the recent intensification of hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina , particularly around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;2	They were unanimous that the solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia can only be reached at the negotiating table , not on the battlefield .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;3	`` Ministers stressed that there must be a cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina , including an immediate ceasefire in and around the safe area of Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;4	`` Ministers supported UNPROFOR efforts to pursue demilitarization , particular of the Bihac safe area and Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;5	They demanded immediate freedom of movement for UNPROFOR and for humanitarian supplies throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;6	`` Ministers agreed that UNPROFOR is performing a mission of great importance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;7	It should continue , provided that the risks do not become unacceptable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;8	`` Ministers instructed the Contact Group to seek resumption of negotiations on this basis , to commence immediately after a ceasefire , particularly in and around the Bihac safe area , and a withdrawal of Bosnian and Krajina Serb forces from this safe area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;9	`` Ministers called for early and mutual recognition between all states of the former Yugoslavia within their internationally recognized borders which is key to the future stability of the region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;10	`` The territorial proposal of the Contact Group with its 51-049 parameter and its commitment to the integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina , remains the basis for a settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;11	`` This territorial proposal can be adjusted by mutual agreement between the parties .
APW_ENG_19941202.0531;12	Constitutional arrangements agreeable to the parties will need to be drawn up which preserve the integrity of Bosnia Herzegovina and allow equitable and balanced arrangements for the Bosnia-Croat and Bosnian Serb entities . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;0	Part of an express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday , its cars sliding into a station building and burying passengers , rail workers and their family members underneath the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;1	Police said at least 24 people died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;2	The accident occurred at Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;3	The second car of the express train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and some of the overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;4	`` There was a tremedous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;5	People remained buried in the wreckage into Friday night , although the crash occured at 4:45 p.m. local time .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;6	Battered and broken railway cars were covered in brick torn loose from the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;7	Rescue crews frantically dragged bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;8	One car , partially twisted beyond recognition , remained skewering the building as a huge crane was positioned shortly before midnight to pluck it from the crumbling brick and mortar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;9	About 200 soldiers and 100 police officers worked into the night looking for survivors and keeping away the curious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;10	Rescue workers said the destroyed building was sleeping quarters for railway personnel and their families , including small children who were likely victims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;11	and that they continued to hear voices from within the wreck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;12	Laszlo Garamvoelgyi , a National Police spokesman , said the death toll had risen to 24 by late Friday with 60 others injured , some seriously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;13	With temperatures below freezing and others left in the wreckage the death toll was expected to rise - Garamvoelgyi said the latest count `` was not the final one by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;14	The severity of the accident eclipsed the previous most serious train tragedy of recent years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;15	Ten children died last February , in a bus-train collision .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;16	Transport ministry officials said the accident occured at a rail switch and suggested that it was possibly caused by the switch not being completely thrown - the car that skewered the building jumped four tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;17	Local Police Chief Gyoergy Lengyel said the train was traveling at about 110 kilometers -LRB- 66 miles -RRB- and hour , normal speed past a station that was not a stop .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;18	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok said 26 injured , including two critical cases , were admitted to their hospital alone , with three others also taking in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;19	Among senior officials at the scene by late Friday evening was Interior Minister Laszlo Kuncze .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;20	`` We are witnesses to a terrible tragedy , '' Kuncze said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0532;21	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;0	Aamir Sohail scored a century and captain Salim Malik made an unbeaten 65 Friday to lead Pakistan to a comfortable victory over Sri Lanka in the first match of the Benson and Hedges quadrangular cricket series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;1	Needing to top Sri Lanka 's 238 for five in its 50 overs , Pakistan reached the target of 239 with 13 balls to spare for the loss of four wickets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;2	Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga scored 101 , his first century in 152 one-day internationals , and was named man of the match .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;3	But Pakistan appeared in control and only faced danger when Sri Lankan outfielders Aravinda de Silva and Roshan Mahanama each made brilliant catches to dismiss Sohail and Ejaz Ahmad .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;4	Malik then steadied the batting , with the benefit of a ruling in his favor by third umpire Barry Lambson after it appeared he had been stumped by offspinner Ruhan Kalpage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;5	The two sides play again Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;6	South Africa and New Zealand are the other two nations in the round-robin tournament for the Mandela Cup , named for new South African President Nelson Mandela .
APW_ENG_19941202.0533;7	All three visiting sides are making their first trips since South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991 after being banned two decades because of apartheid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained U.N. peacekeepers and allow free movement of certain U.N. convoys , the chief U.N. envoy said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;1	Earlier Friday , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the Bosnian presidency building in Sarajevo minutes before Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy for the former Yugoslavia , was to meet with the Muslim-led government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;2	Three more missiles hit nearby buildings during the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;3	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;4	U.N. officials said it appeared to be Serb fire ; the Serbs later accused the Bosnians of attacking themselves to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;5	Akashi later met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;6	After the meeting , Akashi told reporters he had been assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British resupply convoys detained since Saturday , would be freed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;7	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians ... and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;8	Serbs detained more than 400 U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia as insurance against further NATO airstrikes after alliance planes struck Serb targets three times last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;9	Earlier Friday , they released 70 Dutch peacekeepers , detained a week ago with a convoy bound for the eastern enclave of Srebrenica .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;10	The Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;11	Akashi also said the Serbs promised to allow Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in the besieged Bihac enclave to be resupplied .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;12	`` I am very pleased to find willingness of the Bosnian Serb leadership to respond to our urgent appeal , '' Akashi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;13	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;14	Karadzic promised normalized relations , but also called for another meeting first .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;15	`` We certainly need some meeting of the military people of the U.N. and the Serb army , '' Karadzic said , without elaborating .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;16	`` Some issues do not have to wait for the meeting , but some of them require that kind of meeting because of the technical issues . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;17	Karadzic also issued a veiled warning against NATO warplanes enforcing a U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;18	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircrafts and of NATO aircrafts , '' Karadzic said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;19	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;20	NATO sources said allied planes had been fired on by Serb missiles nine times in recent days and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;21	Earlier Friday , Akashi met with Bosnian government officials in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;22	The Bosnian government complained about Akashi 's `` shuttle diplomacy '' and criticized the United Nations for failing to use force to halt the Serb attack on Bihac , a U.N.-designated `` safe area . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;23	`` Instead of doing what they have to do , the U.N. is driving back and forth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;24	... This Munich policy is a humiliation of the international community , '' said Kemal Muftic , chief adviser to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;25	He was referring to the European appeasement of Adolf Hitler at the 1938 Munich meeting before World War II .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;26	Charles Redman , the former U.S. member of the Contact Group and now ambassador to Germany , was also back in Sarajevo , leading bilateral talks with Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on new efforts to reach a peace settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;27	Those new efforts , unveiled Friday night in Brussels by the five-nation Contact Group , include allowing Bosnian Serbs to have some form of political ties to Serb-led Yugoslavia , which they had long sought .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;28	Critics of that new plan said it amounted to appeasement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;29	But Karadzic suggested even that might not now be enough .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;30	He said the Bosnians Serbs must first be guaranteed sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;31	`` Everything can be solved by recognition of our sovereignty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;32	... We have to be either recognized or destroyed . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;33	In a letter to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , carried by his news service SRNA , Karadzic warned the United Nations to drop its `` illusion that Bosnia exists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;34	... This illusion has cost us hundreds of thousands of human lives . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;35	Akashi also discussed a possible cease-fire for Bihac and beyond .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;36	But the Serbs maintained their rejection of a temporary cease-fire , saying they would accept only an end to the war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;37	The Bosnian government fears that would cement Serb territorial gains of 70 percent of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;38	U.N. officials said fighting continued Friday around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;39	But the heaviest action was around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;40	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;41	There were also signs that frontlines south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;42	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;43	Those allied forces took Kupres from the Serbs in a joint attack last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;44	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;45	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0534;46	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out , saying , `` otherwise we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;0	Excerpts of selected editorials carried by Asia-Pacific newspapers in the latest week :
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;1	New battle cry -LRB- Business Times , Kuala Lumpur -RRB- :
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;2	The latest battle cry around the world is '' free trade . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;3	If things go according to plan , there will be a free trade area from Yukon to Tierra del Fuego covering the United States , Canada , Latin America and Caribbean nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;4	The European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- and MERCOSUR -LRB- Southern Common Market -RRB- -- the South American trade grouping of Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay -- have also announced plans to negotiate a free trade zone between them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;5	But other countries in Asia and the Eastern Hemisphere are not as united , nor do they have a plan to develop a trade area in the region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;6	With the rest of the world 's regions joining hands , countries in the Far East may find themselves isolated and too weak to fend for themselves .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;7	They may even be locked out of their major trading partners and regions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;8	In the light of the latest developments , even a major economic power like Japan may not be able to remain unaffected and be able to fend for itself alone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;9	The answer to developments in the rest of the world must be the establishment of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus -LRB- EAEC -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;10	The need is even greater for it now than ever before .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;11	As a caucus , it will enable like-minded people to make a united stand on common issues and concerns and prepare themselves to face the new challenges and battles that may be fought in the world economic arena with the setting up of free trade zones .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;12	Russia 's move on nuclear reactors -LRB- Korea Times , Seoul -RRB- :
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;13	It is dismaying to note that Russia is still seeking to provide its own type of nuclear reactors to North Korea , despite the fact that South Korea , the United States and Japan have already agreed to provide South Korean-type reactors through the international consortium tentatively called the Korea Energy Development Organization -LRB- KEDO -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;14	According to reports , Moscow plans to send a government delegation to Pyongyang within this month to convince the North to accept the Russian-type nuclear reactors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;15	The Russians reportedly reasoned that Russian reactors are the best choice for the North because the nuclear facilities in North Korea had been constructed with the former Soviet Union 's technological aid .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;16	Undeniably , there are some points in Moscow 's assertion , and to resolve the problems , advice and some assistance from Russia may be necessary .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;17	However , the Russian interference in what type of reactor to provide is quite unreasonable and therefore unacceptable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;18	In the first place , the reported Russian overture runs counter to the Geneva nuclear agreement between Washington and Pyongyang , which virtually calls for the South Korean-type reactor to be used with the acquiescence of North Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;19	We worry in this context that the ongoing U.S.-North Korea talks on the reactor issue in Beijing would be hampered or complicated by Moscow 's inappropriate and untimely interference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;20	Unless Moscow is ready to take Seoul 's role in this regard , it is in no position to push for changes in the accord for its own interests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;21	Rather , Russia should remember that it was Soviet nuclear technology and manpower that gave birth to Pyongyang 's nuclear weapons program in the first place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;22	Cosmetic changes in Burma do not justify coddling SLORC -LRB- Nation , Bangkok -RRB- :
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;23	Are we denying reality by duping ourselves that things are getting better in Burma ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;24	Clearly , the two meetings between the military junta , which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council -LRB- SLORC -RRB- , and prodemocracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , currently in her sixth year of house arrest , have been nothing more than stage-managed events .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;25	Certainly , United Nations special rapporteur Yozo Yokota 's report to the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly was cause for alarm .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;26	It states that '' many restrictions on fundamental freedoms and various violations of human rights continue in Myanmar . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;27	As claimed , the SLORC has implemented a number of '' development '' projects in the border areas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;28	It has been argued that economic engagement can make repressive regimes less monstrous , as open markets create a burgeoning meddle class aware of their political rights and freedoms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;29	This middle class , it is argued further , are in turn able to press for liberal reforms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;30	In the case of Burma , however , the economy is held captive by key military establishments , with people being used as forced labor in the name of capitalism .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;31	If one interprets Yokota 's report , there is a strong indication that Burma is on the path to becoming a feudalistic state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;32	The SLORC must take clear and specific steps to ease repression in Burma , and unless this can be verified by the United Nations , there is no business being conciliatory towards the junta .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;33	Diplomatic engagement with a repressive regime will only work if demands are forced down the throats of the tyrants ruling the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0535;34	The West would be practicing double standards if their tough talk is soon dissipated by cosmetic changes made by the SLORC .
APW_ENG_19941202.0536;0	Prince Charles switched on the Christmas lights in the small town near his estate Friday night , as hundreds of his rural neighbors followed him on a stroll around the shops .
APW_ENG_19941202.0536;1	The 45-year-old heir to the throne , wrapped against the December damp in a tweed overcoat , pulled the switch that lit up the center of Tetbury , in the Cotswold region , near his Highbury country estate , 85 miles -LRB- 135 km -RRB- west of London .
APW_ENG_19941202.0536;2	Staff in the Tetbury Catering Company -- selling takeout food -- had a surprise when the prince wandered into their premises unannounced .
APW_ENG_19941202.0536;3	`` He said he could n't resist the smell and just followed his nose into the shop , '' said co-owner Karen Pegler .
APW_ENG_19941202.0536;4	`` He said all the food looked really nice and we were quite a find . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;0	After a slow start , Haiti is moving swiftly to solidify its democratic institutions , appointing a new 11-member Supreme Court and formally placing the army-controlled police under civilian command .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;1	In another supportive step , 250 former Haitian boat people returned home Friday to become members of the internationally supervised interim police force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;2	`` Democracy has returned ; it 's natural for me to return and help my country progress , '' said Jean-Louis Valiere , 31 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;3	He spoke after stepping off a U.S. Coast Guard cutter from the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where 1,000 Haitian refugees have been recruited and trained to serve as interim police .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;4	The separation of the police and military , stipulated in the 1987 Constitution , was approved by the Senate on Wednesday night but only announced on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;5	It will become law when it appears in the official government gazette , Le Moniteur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;6	`` The armed forces reform law is a historic break with our repressive political past , '' Sen. Jean-Robert Martinez told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;7	The appointment of new Supreme Court is another building block to establishing civil justice in a land that has been ruled by the gun for most of its history .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;8	The new chief justice , Clauzel Debrosse , had been an existing member of the Supreme Court but an opponent of the military overthrow in 1991 of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who returned to power in October after U.S. military intervention .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;9	`` We wanted to reward Debrosse for his opposition to de facto rule , '' said Martinez , an Aristide supporter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;10	Aristide , in conformity with the constitution , chose the judges from a Senate list of three for each seat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;11	The array of judicial moves reflects the desire by Aristide to strengthen civilian authority as rapidly as possible .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;12	Thousands of American and other foreign troops are guaranteeing the peace now , but U.S. Republican leaders are urging the Clinton administration to hasten the pullout of GIs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;13	The widely popular Aristide , wary of those who overthrew him three years ago , is quickly reassigning senior military officers to overseas posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;14	U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager confirmed Friday that former Haitian military chief Jean-Claude Duperval was being transferred to a diplomatic post in Brazil and Brig. Gen. Max Mayard was heading to a similar military attache position in Ecuador .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;15	The other two generals during the 1991-4 military rule , Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby , quit and fled to self-imposed exile in Panama two days before Aristide 's return .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;16	Aristide has pledged to slice the size of the army from 7,500 to 1,500 and to create a 4,000-member civilian police force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;17	The 250 Haitians joining the interim police force Friday were recruited and trained in the refugee tent camp at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;18	They were among tens of thousands of Haitians who fled their nation under military rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;19	Another 750 refugees-turned-police will arrive in Haiti in the next three weeks , Schrager , the U.S. spokesman , told the AP .
APW_ENG_19941202.0537;20	`` In coming weeks , they will be used in police support positions by both the Haitian government and the I.P.M. , '' said Paul Browne , spokesman for the 800-member 20-nation International Police Monitor corps that is supervising police work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;0	The U.S. government said Friday it will continue to impound some 36 million pounds -LRB- 16.2 million kilograms -RRB- of frozen Australian beef until tests confirm the meat is free of a pesticide not used in the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;1	Australian tests have already shown the dlrs 65 million worth of beef free of chlorfluazuron , the U.S. Agriculture Department said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;2	But the department 's Food Safety and Inspection Service wants to confirm those results .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;3	Because the pesticide is n't used in the United States , U.S. laboratories do n't have an established way to test the meat , meaning a process will have to be devised .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;4	The meat has been held in warehouses since Nov. 18 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;5	The U.S. Agriculture department says the pesticide poses little human health threat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0539;6	Australian officials said the pesticide showed up in some meat after producers fed cattle with roughage from cotton crops that had been treated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;0	Chiapas residents under the gun of a smoldering Indian rebellion want to believe President Ernesto Zedillo is serious about his inaugural pledge to resume peace talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;1	But people of the southern state , the heart of an uprising rooted in poverty and injustice , said they are skeptical that the daunting hardships can be solved as Zedillo promised .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;2	Zedillo , in an inaugural address Thursday , said his most important challenge would be to provide dignified living conditions for every Mexican .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;3	`` Economic progress only makes sense if it reaches every household , '' said Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;4	`` Many millions of Mexicans lack the bare essentials . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;5	Nowhere is that more apparent than in Chiapas , Mexico 's poorest state , where poverty among Mayan Indians bereft of jobs , housing and basic health care has led to a rebellion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;6	Half of the state 's homes have dirt floors and no running water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;7	Ragamuffin children begging in tattered clothes and gaunt Indian women peddling trinkets are a common sight .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;8	`` We must see deeds , not words , '' said Emilio Morales Lievano , a 21-year-old shoeshine boy in the plaza of San Cristobal de Las Casas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;9	`` The problems stay the same , '' scoffed Jose Francisco Aranda Tinajera , a leader of farmworkers in the southern Chiapas city of Tapachula .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;10	Zedillo promised to seek renewed peace talks with the Zapatista rebels , whose shooting war with the army cost more than 145 lives in January .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;11	A tenuous cease-fire has held since Jan. 12 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;12	`` I am convinced that it is possible to achieve a new negotiation in Chiapas that will lead us to a just , honorable and definitive peace , '' Zedillo said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;13	But the rebels severed all contacts with the government in October and have threatened to resume fighting if demands for full democracy and help for poor Indians are not met .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;14	`` If the earlier president could n't achieve peace , it will be even harder for Zedillo , '' said Morales Lievano , referring to failed peace efforts by former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;15	Now a potentially explosive election dispute in Chiapas is heading for a showdown next week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;16	Eduardo Robledo Rinco , candidate of Mexico 's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , is vowing to take office as Chiapas governor on Thursday , despite charges he won through fraud .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;17	Amado Avendano Figueroa , a journalist-lawyer of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party , suggested Friday that could provoke the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;18	`` We are committed to civil resistance , '' Avendano told supporters Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;19	`` If this civil resistance does n't work , and if the government tries to impose the imposter , no option remains . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;20	Supporters of Avendano launched a series of marches and highway blockades Friday and vowed to storm the government palace in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez to block Robledo 's swearing-in .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;21	Rebellion , political disputes , land clashes and feuding by local bosses all overshadow the problem of poverty in a state where about a fourth of the 3.2 million residents speak an Indian language .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;22	`` We have seen promises made many times before , but what they promise they never fulfill , '' said Pedro Giron Gomez , a 38-year-old Tzeltal Indian .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;23	`` These are all pure lies of the government . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;24	Elia Medina Urbe , a Chiapas sociologist , said Zedillo must break a government pattern of neglect of the state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;25	`` It 's as if the indigenous people did n't exist in the political realm , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;26	But she called Zedillo 's words `` promising , even encouraging . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;27	Zedillo said the Mexican army would continue to abide by the government cease-fire that cut short a shooting war with the rebels .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;28	He said he would also strengthen the legislative and judiciary arms of government while waging his war on poverty and battling corruption .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;29	Laura Clemente , 23 , a schoolteacher in a community of rebel sympathizers near the town of Ocosingo , said the government would first have to change a decades-old style of heavy-handed rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0540;30	`` If the government changes and they give us the help we need , yes there can be peace , '' Clemente concluded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;0	U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 's top civilian official denied Friday that the alliance had abandoned its enforcement of the U.N. `` no-fly '' zone over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;1	`` NATO is continuing to enforce the no-fly zone , '' Christopher said , amid continued confusion between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over how to deal with the crisis in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;2	Earlier Friday , Wing Commander Timothy Hewlet , U.N. director for air operations in Bosnia , told reporters in Sarajevo that Bosnian Serbs had activated several surface-to-air missile sites throughout the country , threatening humanitarian flights and NATO jets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;3	Hewlet said NATO had agreed to a `` cooling off '' period to calm tensions , but was able to `` control '' the situation with AWACs radar planes flying outside Bosnian air space .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;4	`` There are no flights over Bosnia at the moment that I am aware of , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;5	At NATO headquarters , Secretary-General Willy Claes said he was unaware of any request from the United Nations to halt or scale-down allied patrols enforcing the military flight ban , designed to protect Bosnian civilians from bombardment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;6	`` We have never received any request , can I be any clearer than that ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;7	However , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in former Yugoslavia , acknowledged talks on the issue were under way .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;8	`` I can not comment on internal discussions which we are conducting with NATO , '' Akashi told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale , their stronghold east of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;9	`` But I am glad that NATO is adopting an attitude that they are essentially at the service of UNPROFOR -LRB- the U.N. protection force -RRB- in the peacekeeping mission . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;10	NATO and the United Nations have repeatedly talked of the need to `` show presence '' in the skies over Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;11	But NATO sources in Brussels said allied planes had been fired on nine times in recent days by Serb missiles and fixed by targeting radar some 15 times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;12	Under current rules of engagement , NATO planes can strike back if targeted without seeking prior approval from the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;13	Akashi cautioned that NATO air action could threaten delicate negotiations to revive flagging peace efforts and lead to an escalation of fighting .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;14	`` One miscalculation , one misunderstanding and it might become beyond our control , '' he told reporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;15	Christopher told reporters that Serb anti-missile batteries posed a problem .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;16	But , he said , NATO was capable of dealing with them , `` and we continue to police the ` no-fly ' zone in the effective way we have in the past . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;17	In Washington however , a senior U.S. military officer , speaking on condition of anonymity , acknowledged that pilots and other NATO forces were taking steps to lessen the threat to aircraft .

APW_ENG_19941202.0541;20	Western military sources said it appeared that request was extended slightly , and it was not clear if NATO planes were back in Bosnian airspace .
APW_ENG_19941202.0541;21	Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , speaking in Pale after his meeting with Akashi , said , `` We would like to see skies clear of ... NATO aircraft . ''

APW_ENG_19941202.0543;0	Part of an express train headed west for Budapest derailed Friday , its cars sliding into a station building and burying passengers , rail workers and their family members underneath the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;1	Police said at least 24 people died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;2	The accident occurred at Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;3	The second car of the express train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and some of the overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0543;8	One car , partially twisted beyond recognition , remained skewering the collapsed building as a huge crane was positioned shortly before midnight to pluck it from the crumbling brick and mortar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;9	About 100 soldiers and 100 police officers worked into the night looking for survivors and keeping away the curious , as the ministers of defense , interior and transport converged on the accident site .

APW_ENG_19941202.0543;13	With temperatures below freezing and others left in the wreckage , the death toll was expected to rise - Garamvoelgyi said the latest count `` was not the final one by any means . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;14	The severity of the accident eclipsed the previous most serious train tragedy of recent years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;15	Te car that skewered the building jumped four tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;16	Transport Minister Mihaly Lotz said human error seemed to have caused the accident but investigations continued .
APW_ENG_19941202.0543;17	Local Police Chief Gyoergy Lengyel said the train was traveling at about 110 kilometers -LRB- 66 miles -RRB- and hour , normal speed past a station that was not a stop .

APW_ENG_19941202.0544;16	Transport ministry officials said the accident occurred at a rail switch and suggested it was possibly caused by the switch not being completely thrown .

APW_ENG_19941202.0545;0	Author Robin Moore says he was surprised at how he easily obtained information in the former Soviet Union for his book about the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;1	Moore , 69 , the author of the `` French Connection '' and `` The Green Berets , '' spoke Thursday at the Litchfield-Morris Rotary about his latest novel , `` The Moscow Connection , '' which grew out of a 1991 visit to Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;2	`` I was fascinated to find a new era of free speech , '' Moore told the group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;3	`` It seemed everything could be bought and sold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;4	You could even buy the KGB -- I did . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;5	The latest book is a thinly disguised work of fiction chronicling the rise of the Russian mafia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0545;6	Moore hopes his book will expose the burgeoning Russian mafia and what he says is its vigorous trade in the nuclear weaponry of the former Soviet Union .

APW_ENG_19941202.0547;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of peacekeepers and allow aid deliveries as the chief U.N. envoy tried to salvage what was left of the ailing U.N. mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;1	Earlier , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building just minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;2	U.N. officials said the missiles appeared to come from Serb positions , but the Serbs said the government attacked itself to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;3	It was yet another sign of Serb contempt for the peacekeeping effort , which has virtually ground to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;4	The Serb rebels have stopped U.N. aid convoys , attacked a U.N.-declared `` safe area , '' and taken peacekeepers hostage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;5	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher and European foreign ministers endorsed a U.S. plan for a cease-fire that would lead to peace talks in the 2 -LCB- - year-old war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;6	The plan would also grant the Serbs their main aim in the conflict : the right to ties with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;7	The Serbs on Friday released 70 peacekeepers who had been held a week , but more than 300 peacekeepers remained hostage as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;8	Akashi , who met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , said he was assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia would be released , Dutch and British supply convoys detained since Saturday would be freed , and Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in Bihac would be allowed to receive supplies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;9	Karadzic said the Serbs and the U.N. `` are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' but he issued a veiled warning against NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;10	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircraft and of NATO aircraft , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;11	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;12	Under current rules of engagement , the U.N. must request the NATO airstrikes , although NATO planes can defend themselves against attack without U.N. approval .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;13	U.N. officials fear that could escalate tensions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;14	Akashi had met earlier with Bosnian government and military leaders in Sarevejo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;15	Two wire-guided missiles hit the presidency building minutes before he arrived for the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;16	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic , an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;17	Three missiles hit nearby buildings while the meeting went on .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;18	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;19	The Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for not using force to halt fighting at Bihac , the embattled government-held enclave in the northwest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;20	Serb forces have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the `` safe area , '' and fighting continued there Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;21	U.S. Ambassador to Germany Charles Redman held talks in Sarajevo with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the U.S. peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;22	Redman helped draft an earlier plan that the Serbs rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;23	The war began when Serbs rebelled against a vote for independence from Yugoslavia by Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;24	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the war , and the Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;25	Following the secession since 1991 of Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Macedonia , Yugoslavia now comprises Serbia and Montenegro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;26	Serb nationalists in Yugoslavia , Croatia and Bosnia have pressed for a unified `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;27	The rejected peace plan denied Serbs the right to links with Yugoslavia as punishment for starting the war , but allowed Bosnia 's Croats and Muslims the right to ties with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;28	The old plan also granted the Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia -- a condition the new plan also contains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;29	Akashi had more success than U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was rebuffed Wednesday when he tried to meet with Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;30	Boutros-Ghali said afterwards that intransigence by the warring sides might force the U.N. mission to withdraw .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;31	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;32	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , plus hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;33	U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said Akashi also wanted to discuss the fighting around Bihac with Karadzic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;34	The United Nations is trying to broker a cease-fire there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;35	Machine-gun and small arms fire was reported on the outskirts of Bihac , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;36	The heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;37	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;38	There were also signs that fronts south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;39	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;40	Croat militia and Bosnian army soldiers took Kupres from the Serbs last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;41	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;42	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;43	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out or `` we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;44	In Knin , Croatia , the Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0547;45	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;0	Hundreds of angry people descended on a neighborhood gunmen when multinational soldiers freed him Friday , prompting the foreign soldiers to return to save him two hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;1	Samuel Chery , who had terrorized a neighborhood in this Port-au-Prince suburb during military coup rule from 1991 to October , had been held for nearly two months after U.S. soldiers arrested him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;2	Chery , known as `` Ti Samuel , '' was an `` attache , '' one of thousands of thugs who had Haitian military support to beat or kill supporters of democracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;3	He was freed by foreign troops at 2 p.m. , prompting uncomprehending screams by neighbors , many of whom feared their lives if the attaches returned to the streets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;4	Hundreds of people gathered , grabbing sticks or carrying machetes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;5	They surrounded Chery 's home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;6	He had thrown rocks out at them and locked his door .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;7	Another Humvee carrying foreign soldiers arrived two hours later and took away Chery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;8	Telephones were not functioning at the U.S. military 's Joint Information Bureau late Friday , and it was not clear why Chery was freed or where he was being held .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;9	Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark accused the United States Friday of protecting members of the right-wing terror group FRAPH even after intervening to return exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;10	The Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti says its converting into a political organization , and a leader , Emmanuel Constant , renounced violence at a U.S.-arranged news conference two months ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;11	`` The same forces that planned the coup '' are maintaining the level of violence , Clark told reporters after a five-day fact-finding mission of his Haiti Commission human rights group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;12	`` The longer the criminals go unpunished , the more likely it is that the people will take justice into their own hands , '' said lawyer Michael Ratner , another commission member and director of the New York-based Center for Constititonal Rights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;13	The U.N. civilian mission in a Nov. 22 communique said `` a certain degree of violence prevailed until the end of October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;14	Since then , without having entirely disappeared , violent incidents are much rarer . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0548;15	The mission reported , however , that many people believe `` that the disarmament and dismantlement of groups which were part of the former repressive apparatus have been insufficient . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;0	The United States and four other governments on Friday tried to restart the drive for peace in Bosnia with a plea for support of a plan designed to lure advancing Serbs with a prospect of political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;1	Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the group rejected the options of `` carpet bombing '' or surrender , agreeing to resubmit a plan whose basic terms the Serbs rejected in the past .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;2	`` The road will be very difficult , '' Christopher said , referring to the new attempt to draw the Serbs into peace talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;3	The hint of a step toward a Greater Serbia was contained in a one-page text of the agreement distributed after Christopher met with the foreign ministers of Britain , France , Germany and Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;4	It said the idea was to `` allow equitable and balanced arrangements for the Bosniac-Croat and Bosnian Serb entities . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;5	This proclaims that since the Muslim-led Bosnian government and Bosnian Croats have formed a federation linked to Croatia , the Bosnian Serbs have the same right to seek cross-border political ties to Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;6	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , who led a successful European campaign to move the Clinton administration from its support for NATO bombing raids on Serb positions , called this assurance a matter of giving all parties `` an equal opportunity . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;7	He and the other ministers stressed , however , that the Serbs must recognize the legitimacy of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;8	The ministers emphasized they had reached unity after lengthy wrangling on how to deal with the war over the last 31 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;9	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , who chaired the meeting of the five-nation `` contact group , '' said the fighting in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia had reached an awful state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;10	He said the war can not be solved with external military force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;11	Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will go to Belgrade on Sunday in pursuit of a diplomatic solution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;12	Both stressed that while they would carry the joint decision with them , they would be meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as representatives of their governments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;13	Michael McCurry , the State Department spokesman , said U.S. envoy Charles E. Redman went to Sarajevo on Thursday for meetings with Bosnian Muslim leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;14	He also told reporters the proposal Christopher had prepared for an international peace conference was being held `` in abeyance '' until the various consultations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;15	The meeting of the U.S.-allied contact group came as the Bosnian Serbs tightened their grip on the mostly Muslim Bihac enclave and as the conflict threatened to spread into Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;16	Christopher wants Milosevic to threaten to seal Serbia 's border to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;17	Despite a promise to halt weapons deliveries , Clinton administration officials said , arms were still getting through to fuel the Bosnian Serbs ' drive to gain more territory and to terrorize Muslim civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;18	The war has taken an estimated 200,000 lives and left many times that number homeless .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;19	Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs , contributing to the decision by the U.N. commander , Sir Michael Rose , not to conduct heavy bombing raids against the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;20	Meanwhile , a senior U.S. military officer , briefing reporters at the Pentagon , reported that NATO has begun planning to prepare for its role in the possible evacuation of U.N. peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;21	`` We are doing planning at the NATO level for a withdrawal -- when and if that ever comes about , '' said the officer , who spoke on condition his name not be used .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;22	The officer emphasized that no request to help in such a move had come from the United Nations , but that it was `` prudent '' to prepare for such a move , even though a U.N. withdrawal did not appear imminent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;23	Christopher 's plan , which was adopted by President Clinton 's senior foreign policy advisers Monday at a White House meeting , calls for a cease-fire in the Bihac area , a cessation of hostilities for three to six months throughout Bosnia and a peace conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;24	There , the Bosnian Serbs would be able to promote their aspirations for a Greater Serbia , initially with political links to Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;25	They hope also to establish cross-border ties to ethnic Serbs in Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;26	Elements of the plan are similar to one rejected repeatedly by the Bosnian Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;27	It called for them to accept Bosnia as a legitimate country and to shrink the territory under their control to 49 percent from about 70 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;28	A federation of Muslims and Croats would be in charge of 51 percent of the war-torn country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0549;29	Even that division is negotiable once peace talks are resumed , U.S. officials said , hoping to induce the Serbs to halt their attacks and to negotiate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;0	Zachariah Toungate has spent a third of his life fighting for the right to wear a ponytail to school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;1	About the only thing that 's changed in those four years is the length of his hair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;2	State District Judge Norman Lanford ruled this week that the Bastrop school district 's above-the-bottom-of-the-collar hair rule for boys violates the Texas Constitution 's Equal Rights Amendment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;3	But he said the courts have given administrators broad authority in running schools , and refused to revoke the rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;4	Though Zach wo n't be returning to school -- and may appeal -- the 12-year-old said he feels good about the ruling .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;5	`` The judge said it was unconstitutional , and he said that he thought that was wrong , '' said the boy , whose ponytail is now about 15 inches -LRB- 38 centimeters -RRB- long .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;6	Ray Long , president of the School Board , said there is no sentiment on the board to change the rule .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;7	`` I think that hair , dress and grooming standards are good , '' Long said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;8	The fight started in 1990 when Zach refused to cut his hair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;9	He was separated from other third-graders and taught alone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;10	He was prohibited from participating in extracurricular activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;11	In 1991 , Zach 's parents withdrew him from school and taught him at home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;12	They sued to abolish the rule so he could return to class .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;13	The case finally went to trial in October in Bastrop , a town of 4,000 people about 35 miles -LRB- 56 kilometers -RRB- east of Austin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;14	The jury ruled in the school district 's favor , but the judge indicated jurors may have been confused , and he issued his own ruling .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;15	School officials had argued that if the hair-length rule were repealed , it would lead to gangs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;16	But Lanford , in his ruling Tuesday , said that argument was `` solely designed to frighten the jury . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;17	He said the district had failed to prove that students ' schooling would be disrupted .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;18	Zach continues to receive schooling at home , studying reading , math and history through correspondence courses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;19	The seventh-grader said it 's difficult to make new friends since he does n't go to school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;20	Zach 's mother , September , and father , Stanley , are backing their son .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;21	`` It has been worth it .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;22	Discrimination is wrong , '' said his mother , a 33-year-old nurse at an adolescent psychological center .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;23	The boy 's father , a 44-year-old auto mechanic and electrician , had long hair when Zach decided to grow his long , too , said the boy 's lawyer , Charles Beall .
APW_ENG_19941202.0550;24	Later , the elder Toungate cut his hair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;0	Skirting differences over tax cuts , welfare and health insurance , President Clinton and leaders of the incoming Republican Congress agreed at a White House summit Friday to work together on a batch of less-divisive issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;1	Emerging from their first talks with Clinton since November elections gave the Republicans control of Congress , incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said , `` certainly it 's in our interest , where possible , to be together . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;2	Rep. Newt Gingrich , the incoming House of Representatives speaker , said , `` We agreed as a principle that there would be areas in which we would disagree but I do n't think we actually spent much time on them . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;3	The Republicans said the meeting was positive ; Gingrich called it `` superb . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;4	But it was clear they avoided areas of likely disagreement such as taxes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;5	`` We did n't cover everything , we did n't get down to the T 's , '' Dole said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;6	Hours before the meeting , Clinton served notice in a speech that he would fight tax cuts that inflate the budget deficit and any attempt to repeal the new ban on assault weapons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;7	Gingrich said Clinton agreed to work with Republicans on easing costly requirements imposed on the states by Washington and enacting a line-item veto allowing the president to delete some projects from legislation without killing it altogether .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;8	Dole said he suggested that Clinton consult with Republicans more on foreign policy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;9	As for further talks with Clinton , Dole said , `` I assume anytime we want to meet , the president 's going to be accessible . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;10	`` I hope and believe we can cooperate with the new Congress , '' Clinton said earlier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;11	`` But cooperation for me can not mean abandoning principle , abandoning the hard work we have already accomplished together in our fight to restore the economy , our fight against crime . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;12	Addressing a national meeting of mayors and city officiais , he drew the line against relaxing gun controls enacted by the just-ended Congress over opposition from the National Rifle Association .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;13	`` The assault weapons ban that you helped to win stands between the citizens you and I must protect and the gangs and thugs that would terrorize them , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;14	`` I will do all in my power to keep the next Congress from doing anything that will jeopardize the safety of our people . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;15	Separately , Clinton also met in the Cabinet Room with newly named Congressional leaders of his Democratic Party , now in the minority .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;16	Afterwards , Sen. Tom Daschle , the new Democratic leader , said Democrats will work with the White House but that , `` Clearly , we have our own agenda as well . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;17	`` It 's no secret that the landscape in Washington shifted dramatically last month , '' Clinton said ruefully , referring to the November elections that gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and a majority of U.S. state governorships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;18	Clinton 's administration fears the rival parties might try to outdo each other on tax cuts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;19	He said he would fight any proposal that would `` explode the deficit ... my standard will be : Will it help increase incomes for the middle class , will it promote jobs and growth and can we pay for it ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;20	In his speech broadcast from Washington to the National League of Cities conference in Minneapolis , Clinton said , `` We need to give hard working middle-class people a dividend from the end of the Cold War and the dramatic downsizing of the federal government . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;21	The Republican campaign 's Contract with America called for an array of tax credits .
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;22	Clinton urged city officials who have been complaining about inadequate funds for essential services `` to make sure that the Congress understands what the consequences are of all these budgetary decisions . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0551;23	In the afterglow of bipartisan support for the new world trade agreement , Clinton said he hoped to work with Republicans on welfare and health-care reform , cost-controls on medical care and easing the financial demands imposed on cities and states by Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;0	An express train derailed southeast of Budapest Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station building and burying passengers , railroad workers and their family under the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;1	At least 24 people were killed , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;2	The accident occurred at 4:45 p.m. in Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;3	The second car of the train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and the overturned carriages crashed into a station building used as sleeping quarters by railway personnel and their families , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;4	`` There was a tremendous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;5	He said in a telephone interview that some people remained buried in the wreckage into Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;6	`` We are witnesses to a terrible tragedy , '' said Interior Minister Laszlo Kuncze , who joined other senior officials at the scene late Friday evening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;7	Battered and broken railway cars were covered by bricks torn loose from the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;8	Rescue crews frantically dragged bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;9	One car , partially twisted beyond recognition , remained skewering the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;10	A huge crane was positioned shortly before midnight to pluck it from the crumbling brick and mortar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;11	About 100 soldiers and 100 police officers worked into the night looking for survivors and keeping away onlookers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;12	Rescue workers said they continued to hear voices from within the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;13	Defense Minister Gyoergy Keleti said dogs normally used to locate victims of mining disasters had found three children who were dug out from the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;14	National police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi said the death toll had risen to 24 by late Friday with 60 others injured , some seriously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;15	With temperatures below freezing and others still trapped in the wreckage , the death toll was expected to rise , Garamvoelgyi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;16	There were fears the victims could include the children of the railway workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;17	Transport ministry officials said the accident occurred at a rail switch and suggested it was possibly caused by the switch not being completely thrown .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;18	The car that skewered the building jumped four tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;19	Transport Minister Mihaly Lotz said human error appeared to have caused the accident but the investigation continued .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;20	Local police Chief Gyoergy Lengyel said the train was traveling at about 110 kilometers -LRB- 66 miles -RRB- an hour , the normal speed for passing a station that was not a stop .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;21	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok said 26 injured people , including two critical cases , had been admitted to their hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;22	Several other hospitals were also taking in the injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0553;23	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest , to the capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;0	The chief drug enforcement official of the U.S. government Friday congratulated Thailand for arresting 10 people believed to be top lieutenants of one of the world 's biggest heroin traffickers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;1	The arrests came after two years of internatioanl cooperation and a months-long pursuit of the 10 suspects , said DEA Administrator Thomas A. Constantine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;2	Police of Thailand 's Narcotics Suppression Bureau carried out the arrests this past week in Bangkok and northern Thailand .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;3	Those arrested are said to be close aides of the notorious drug warlord Khun Sa , who is based in the Burmese jungle in the `` Golden Triangle '' region where the borders of Thailand , Burma and Laos meet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;4	`` That 's like going into Sicily and grabbing the 10 biggest Mafia figures
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;5	and taking them away , '' said Constantine , who is on a tour of the region .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;6	Most of the heroin that comes to the United States originates in the Golden Triangle , and U.S. authorities say Khun Sa is the trade 's kingpin there .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;7	He has an estimated 10,000 men in his Shan United Army , whose main purpose Khun Sa claims is to press Burma 's central government for autonomy for the Shan ethnic minority .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;8	Speaking at a news conference , Constantine described heroin trafficking and addiction as a growing social problem for the United States and much of the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;9	He said that heroin sold in major cities in the United States is now 100 times as pure as it was in the early 1970s -- jumping from 7 percent to 70 percent -- while its price has been cut by half .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;10	Violent crime , as well as the spread of AIDS through the sharing of needles by addicts , are only two of its consequences , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;11	`` The individual primarily responsible for this worldwide devastation of drug addiction is Khun Sa and his Shan United Army , '' said Constantine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;12	`` He has delivered as much evil to this world as any Mafia don has ever done in our history . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;13	Constantine revealed details behind the recent arrests , which were carried out by police of Thailand 's Narcotics Suppression Bureau , with little fanfare .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;14	He said that for the past two years a combined group of Thai police and military , narcotics units , and border police , along with American DEA , State Department , immigration and customs officials have targeted Khun Sa as `` the kingpin Mafia druglord most important in the entire globe . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;15	As a result of their investigations , a U.S. federal court in New York City had issued indictments against major figures in Khun Sa 's drug trafficking ring , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;16	The same task force that conducted the investigations has been tracking `` for months '' the people arrested this week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;17	`` When these druglords are brought to the justice that I think they so richly deserve , and the appropriate punishment is given to them for the evil they have produced , then the whole world can properly thank Thailand and these dedicated public servants for their contributions to making this a better world , '' Constantine said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;18	Constantine came to Thailand from Hong Kong , and will next visit Malaysia and Singapore .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;19	The purpose of his tour , a DEA spokeswoman said , is `` to see firsthand the extent of heroin production and trafficking and to ask the governments with which we deal about how we can help cooperate for greater progress in this area . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;20	Constantine said he hopes some way could be found to more effectively tackle drug production in Burma , where the United States maintains a minimal drug enforcement presence because of concerns over human rights abuses by that country 's ruling military junta .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;21	`` My position is that this is a country which produces between 60 and 70 percent of the world 's heroin ; they are inflicting , that group of people on the border area , ... great damage on the world .
APW_ENG_19941202.0554;22	And I think we have to find some resolution to the problem so we can address it . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;0	An express train derailed southeast of Budapest Friday sending cars smashing into a railroad station building and burying passengers , railroad workers and their family under the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;1	At least 24 people were killed , police said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;2	The accident occurred at 4:45 p.m. in Szajol , a station near Szolnok about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- southeast of the Hungarian capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;3	The second car of the train derailed , dragging three other cars with it , and the overturned carriages crashed into a station building used as sleeping quarters by railway personnel and their families , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;4	`` There was a tremendous explosion , like the end of the world , '' said a railway employee who witnessed the accident and asked not to be identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;5	He said in a telephone interview that some people remained buried in the wreckage into Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;6	`` We are witnesses to a terrible tragedy , '' said Interior Minister Laszlo Kuncze , who joined other senior officials at the scene late Friday evening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;7	Battered and broken railway cars were covered by bricks torn loose from the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;8	Rescue crews frantically dragged bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;9	One car , partially twisted beyond recognition , remained skewering the building .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;10	A huge crane was positioned shortly before midnight to pluck it from the crumbling brick and mortar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;11	About 100 soldiers and 100 police officers worked into the night looking for survivors and keeping away onlookers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;12	Rescue workers said they continued to hear voices from within the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;13	Defense Minister Gyoergy Keleti said dogs normally used to locate victims of mining disasters had found three children who were dug out from the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;14	National police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi said the death toll had risen to 24 by late Friday with 60 others injured , some seriously .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;15	With temperatures below freezing and others still trapped in the wreckage , the death toll was expected to rise , Garamvoelgyi said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;16	There were fears the victims could include the children of the railway workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;17	Transport ministry officials said the accident occurred at a rail switch and suggested it was possibly caused by the switch not being completely thrown .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;18	The car that skewered the building jumped four tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;19	Transport Minister Mihaly Lotz said human error appeared to have caused the accident but the investigation continued .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;20	Local police Chief Gyoergy Lengyel said the train was traveling at about 110 kilometers -LRB- 66 miles -RRB- an hour , the normal speed for passing a station that was not a stop .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;21	Doctors at one hospital near Szolnok said 26 injured people , including two critical cases , had been admitted to their hospital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;22	Several other hospitals were also taking in the injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0555;23	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Budapest , to the capital .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;0	A U.S. lawyer who is in Guatemala searching for her guerrilla husband was banned Friday from leaving the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;1	Jennifer Harbury had said she intended to file charges against the government in the disappearance of her husband , Efrain Bamaca .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;2	She was barred from leaving under a complex law that requires a person to file charges against the state after saying that they intend to do so .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;3	`` Any person who has stated their intention to press charges against the state ... can in turn be legally forced by the state to pursue the accusation , '' said her lawyer , Antonio Argueta .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;4	`` In Jennifer 's case we do not see it as a purely legal measure but as a ... way to debilitate the search for her husband , '' Argueta added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;5	Harbury , based in Washington , D.C. , contends the government illegally detained and tortured Bamaca , who has not been seen since 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;6	`` I was always going to press charges against those military officials ... who saw my husband being tortured inside a military base but now the Guatemalan government is forcing me to do it sooner , '' Harbury told The Associated Press .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;7	Guatemala gives a person 15 days to file charges after announcing an intent to do so .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;8	Harbury returned to Guatemala to cooperate with investigations by the Supreme Court of Justice and a government human rights office into her husband 's whereabouts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;9	Both the military and the government deny Bamaca was ever captured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;10	President Ramiro de Leon Carpio repeatedly claims Bamaca died in combat and says clandestine jails do not exist in Guatemala .
APW_ENG_19941202.0556;11	However , evidence made public by the U.S. State Department in November indicates that Bamaca was captured alive by the Guatemalan army with slight injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;0	The U.S. Postal Service on Friday defended its stamp recalling the atomic bombing of Japan saying that it could not omit such a major event from its World War II history series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;1	The stamp , showing a mushroom-shaped cloud rising from an atomic blast , is one of a set of 10 stamps marking major events of 1945 to be sold on a sheet titled `` 1945 : Victory at Last . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;2	Forty stamps have already been issued in similar sets for the 50th anniversary of the 1941-44 war years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;3	But the atomic bomb stamp is drawing sharp criticism in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;4	Sunao Tsuboi , acting director of the 30,000-member Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-bomb Survivors Organizations , termed it `` outrageous . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;5	Japan surrendered Aug. 15 , 1945 , days after atomic bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;6	`` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , August 1945 , '' says the caption on the mushroom cloud stamp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;7	Postal Service spokesman Robin Wright said the World War II series was developed in cooperation with the State and Defense departments to assure historical accuracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;8	As far as the atomic bomb stamp , he said , `` we would be remiss in omitting such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic bomb . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;9	`` Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of events of World War II , and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events , '' Wright added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;10	Asked for comment on the issue , the State Department said in a statement late Friday it has been in contact with the Postal Service , and understands that `` the stamps are not intended for the general public but rather for philatelists . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;11	`` We understand the matter is still under consideration , '' the statement added .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;12	It did not reply to a question whether there had been discussions with the Japanese government explaining the matter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;13	Other stamps in the 1945 set picture U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima , `` Okinawa , the last big battle , '' liberations of Manila and of Holocaust survivors in Europe , Germany 's surrender at Reims , refugees uprooted by war and U.S. celebrations of Japanese surrender .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;14	The 1941 set , titled `` A World at War '' included stamps showing Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill framing the Atlantic Charter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0557;15	The 1944 set , titled `` Road to Victory '' included the allied Normandy landings , the liberation of Rome and the battles of Leyte Gulf in the Pacific and the Bulge in Belgium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;0	The United States has offered shelter in its refugee camps to up to 900 of the Cubans who have fled to this tiny British territory , Cayman officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;1	If the Cubans accept the offer , they would go to camps at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Panama , Gerry Maguire , the territory 's chief immigration officer , told the refugees in a meeting at their tented camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;2	The U.S. camps already hold thousands of refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;3	The Cayman refugees probably would n't be transferred until early next year , government spokeswoman Pat Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;4	`` It will be a significant weight off our shoulders , '' Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;5	The announcement came after months of talks with U.S. officials and the day after more than 300 Cuban women and children marched peacefully through George Town calling on the United States to let them in .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;6	Also Friday , the United States announced new immigration rules that will allow more Cuban families now sheltered in refugee camps to enter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;7	Hundreds of Cubans fled here after riots in Havana in early August prompted Cuban President Fidel Castro to say he would not prevent people from leaving .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;8	The approximately 1,150 Cubans now sheltered here represent about 4 percent of the 30,000 residents of this tourist resort and offshore banking center just 70 miles -LRB- 110 kilometers -RRB- south of Cuba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;9	But the Caymans ' Cuban problem is far from resolved , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;10	Many Cubans have said they do n't want to go to Guantanamo because it 's too close to the home they want to escape and because a larger camp does n't appeal to them , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;11	Even if all 900 accept , that still leaves 250 refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;12	The Cayman government has decided to grant asylum to a small , as-yet-undetermined number of Cubans who fled political persecution , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;13	Twenty-four refugees have asked to return to their homeland and will be flown back , probably within two weeks , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;14	As a last resort , the Cayman government could repatriate those who remain , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;15	`` We 're really not heaving a sigh of relief .
APW_ENG_19941202.0560;16	Not for ourselves and not for the Cubans , '' Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;0	President Clinton on Friday ordered that no U.S. government funds be spent on human embryo research , rejecting a recommendation made just hours earlier by a federal advisory committee .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;1	`` I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes , '' Clinton said , continuing the ban imposed by Presidents Reagan and Bush before him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;2	`` I have directed that the National Institutes of Health not allocate any resources for such research , '' Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;3	He said research on fertilized human eggs `` raises profound ethical and moral questions as well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of federal funds . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;4	The report of the NIH 's human embryo committee said the research had the potential of finding new ways to correct infertility , prevent or correct birth defects , and learn fundamental cell biology that might help combat cancer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;5	After studying the issue for nine months , the committee delivered its recommendations this week to another panel that advises NIH Director Harold Varmus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;6	That panel endorsed the recommendations , leaving the final decision up to Varmus on if , when and how the NIH would proceed with research grants -- until Clinton took it out of Varmus ' hands later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;7	Clinton praised the work of the committees and said he understood how the research could make advances in in vitro fertilization , the so-called test tube baby technique .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;8	He also said he planned to establish a bioethics advisory commission to further deliberate such issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;9	The advisory committee acknowledged that many people had ethical and moral reservations about its recommendation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;10	Under the recommendation , embryo research would have been subject to strict controls , including limiting it to the first 14 days after fertilization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;11	At that point , a fertilized human egg has grown to hundreds of cells but has not yet developed a nervous system , specific tissues or a human form .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;12	The White House announcement came as opponents of human embryo research , mostly groups that also oppose abortion , were gathering forces for a showdown in Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;13	A coalition of the opponents planned a news conference on Monday and one congressman already had pledged to support their efforts with legislation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;14	`` Regardless of any potential medical advancements , human dignity must not be degraded by having life created in a laboratory dish just to have it thrown out with the trash when scientists are finished with their Frankenstein-type experiments , '' said Rep. Robert Dornan , R-Calif. , who promised to carry the fight to Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;15	Richard Doerfinger of the U.S. Catholic Conference said his organization would support efforts to block any federal funding for the embryo research .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;16	Guidelines for embryo research were first recommended by an NIH committee in 1979 , but Presidents Reagan and Bush opposed it and the process withered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;17	Varmus , who was appointed by President Clinton , revived the effort by naming the embryo research committee earlier this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;18	Despite the lack of federal funds , clinics and universities that provide in vitro fertilization services -- the so-called test-tube-baby technique of assisting reproduction for infertile couples -- have privately financed extensive research for more than a decade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;19	Dr. Steven Muller , president emeritus of Johns Hopkins University and chairman of the embryo advisory panel that studied the issue for months , said members of that committee received more than 50,000 pieces of mail , most of it protesting government support for the research .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;20	`` The public has no idea what human embryo research means , but to most people it does seem terrible , '' Muller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0563;21	`` The extreme high level of public ignorance invites exploitation '' by opponents to the research .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;0	This year 's drop in the stock market may accomplish what six interest-rate tightenings by the Federal Reserve have apparently failed to do : Slow the economy down .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;1	So argues inveterate market bear Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co. , in a recent research report .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;2	Despite the fact that blue-chip stocks have held up well , many investors have experienced a 5 to 10 percent drop in the value of their stock portfolios this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;3	Stock investors `` feel poorer and they are poorer '' than they were last Jan. 1 , Metz said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;4	They will assess their losses for the year and , alarmed about the erosion of their net worth , put a tight lid on discretionary spending .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;5	That in turn will finally put the brakes on a seemingly unstoppable economy , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;6	`` The decline in stock values -- and the drop already seen in the bond market this year -- is expected to have a tangible wealth effect on householders who now have their highest exposure in decades to stocks and bonds as a percentage of their assets , '' Metz writes in a Nov. 23 report entitled , `` Will the Stock Market do the Fed 's Work ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;7	`` The result ... '' Metz writes , `` is a slowdown in personal consumption spending generally in 1995 , and a growth recession by the second quarter of 1995 . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;8	Metz turns on its head the conventional wisdom that Federal Reserve credit tightenings should , by themselves , slow the economy down .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;9	He got some support from economic reports this past week that show the economy continues to chug along , despite a better than 2 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates since last February .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;10	The most recent of these was a report Friday that the nation 's nonfarm payrolls added an impressive 350,000 jobs in November , pushing the unemployment rate down by 0.2 percentage points to 5.6 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;11	Stocks initially stalled on the news but then posted some respectable gains as bond prices surged , pushing inerest rates lower .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;12	The Dow Jones industrial average finished Friday 's session at 3,745.62 , up 44.75 for the day and up 37.35 for the week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;13	Analysts said Friday 's rally occurred for largely technical reasons , however , and they remained cautious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;14	`` We have gotten through a week of news and the market has , for whatever it 's worth , held together , '' said Hugh Johnson , market strategist at First Albany Corp.
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;15	Metz argues that , whether interest rates move higher or not , the drop in the stock market itself will arrest economic growth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;16	But Johnson said , `` I think it 's not that easy . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;17	This year 's Fed tightenings , as aggressive as they have been , have not had enough time to work , Johnson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;18	Interest rate changes typically do not affect the economy for 12 to 18 months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;19	And exports , government spending and business investments , all of which have a big impact on the economy , are likely to ebb and flow independently of the stock market , Johnson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;20	Still , Metz pointed out that when the stock market crashed in 1987 , many investors watched from the sidelines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;21	A large portion of their investments were in bonds , because interest rates were relatively high at the time , Metz said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;22	Now , households have more than a third of their financial assets in stocks , according to industry studies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;23	That compares with an average of about 26 percent since 1945 and means that individual investors -- and the economy -- are especially vulnerable to market downturns , Metz said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0565;24	On Friday , the New York Stock Exchange 's composite index rose 1.97 to 248.01 , up 0.41 for the week .

APW_ENG_19941202.0567;0	Bosnian Serb leaders promised Friday to release hundreds of detained United Nations peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;1	But there was no confirmation that 55 detained Canadians peacekeepers were free to move .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;2	Here are some key dates surrounding their detention :
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;3	Nov. 19 -- UN Security Council extends NATO air authority to Croatia after Serb warplanes flying from an air base in Udbina , in Serb-controlled Croatia , launch air strikes on the UN-declared safe haven of Bihac in northwest Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0567;8	Bosnian Muslim-led government troops block attempt to transfer 150 non-essential personnel from the Canadian base at Visoko to Kiseljak , some 15 kilometres away .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;9	Nov. 25 -- NATO jets fly over Serb positions near Bihac but due to darkness drop no bombs as Serb forces advance into the enclave , controlled by the Muslim-led government army .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;10	Serbs allow some of the detained Canadians to carry out work at their observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;11	Muslims lift blockade of Canadian camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;12	Nov. 26 -- Canadian troops come under fire three times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;13	No one is injured : a convoy of buses carrying Canadians to Visoko from Split , Croatia , is hit by five mortars ; two rifle grenades hit Canadian headquarters in Knin in Serb-controlled Croatia ; mortar round lands near Canadian vehicle in Knin area .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;14	Nov. 27 -- Between six and 10 rockets fired by Bosnian Serbs land near the Canadian camp in Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;15	Shrapnel from two rockets damages a camp building where Canadian soldiers are sleeping .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;16	No one is injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;17	Negotiations to free the detained Canadians continue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;18	Nov. 28 -- The UN commander in Bosnia , Lt.-Gen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;19	Sir Michael Rose , and Col. Bill Brough , commander of the Canadian battalion in Visoko , fail to win release of the Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;20	A Serb offer to let the Canadians return to base if they 're replaced by another 55 Canadians is rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;21	Nov. 30 -- a Bosnian Serb threat to shell the Canadian camp within 48 hours passed without incident .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;22	However , the peacekeepers increased security and placed sandbags around sleeping quarters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;23	Dec. 2 -- UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Bosnian-Serb leaders agreed to allow the detained peacekeepers to go about their normal activities .
APW_ENG_19941202.0567;24	Canadian officers could n't confirm the reports of agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;0	Next week 's talks between Britain and the IRA 's political allies will be delayed by two days at the party 's request , the government announced Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;1	There was no immediate explanation from Sinn Fein for the delay of the long-sought talks that are the next big step in the search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland following the Irish Republican Army 's 3-month-old cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;2	Prime Minister John Major on Thursday invited Sinn Fein to meet government officials in Belfast on Wednesday , Dec. 7 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;3	The government 's Northern Ireland Office said Friday that the first exploratory dialogue will now take place Friday , Dec. 9 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;4	Government officials said the Northern Ireland Office had no problem with opening the talks 48 hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;5	Officials said there had been contact between the two sides on Friday and that Sinn Fein had said they could not manage to make the meeting on Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;6	The talks will be the first publicly acknowledged meeting between the two sides since the conflict over British rule of Northern Ireland ignited in 1969 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;7	The meeting evolved from the peace process begun last December when the British and Irish governments offered Sinn Fein a place in talks if the IRA laid down its arms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;8	The outlawed group began an open-ended truce Sept. 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;9	News reports , meanwhile , reported that suspects arrested in a West Belfast robbery were known republicans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;10	Police would not confirm that , saying they did not know who those being questioned were .
APW_ENG_19941202.0570;11	They said that after the robbery of a filling station Friday morning , police made `` a number of arrests '' and found an imitation firearm , masks and a sum of money .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;0	Heidi Fleiss , who once boasted that her prostitution ring catered to the `` top 1 percent '' of Hollywood 's elite , was convicted Friday of providing high-price call girls to undercover police officers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;1	After four days of deliberations , a jury found the 28-year-old pediatrician 's daughter guilty on three of five pandering charges .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;2	The seven-man , five-woman jury deadlocked on the two other counts , and acquitted her of supplying cocaine to an undercover police officer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;3	Fleiss was visibly unhappy with the outcome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;4	She slammed her hands on the defense table and laid down her head as the guilty verdicts were read .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;5	Her father , seated behind her in the front row of the courtroom , hung his head .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;6	Fleiss faces a minimum of three years , and up to eight years and eight months in prison .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;7	A sentencing hearing was set for Jan. 20 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;8	Fleiss and her father , Paul , await a second trial in January on federal charges they laundered profits from the call-girl ring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;9	Prosecutor Alan Carter said he was pleased with the verdict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;10	The district attorney 's office had n't immediately decided whether to retry Fleiss on the two deadlocked counts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;11	Fleiss posted the dlrs 75,000 bail set by Superior Court Judge Judith L. Champagne .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;12	Much of the six-day trial focused on police conduct , with Fleiss ' attorneys insisting she was entrapped .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;13	Juror Nancy Reyes , 24 , said Fleiss was acquitted on the cocaine charge and two of the pandering counts because the jury felt the police acted unethically .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;14	`` I personally feel the police went beyond reasonable conduct , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;15	`` They 're supposed to follow restrained steps . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;16	Juror Sheila Mitrowski criticized the broad scope of the investigation and said she felt police `` were fishing for a whale and came up very short . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;17	After the scandal broke last year , there was speculation that Fleiss ' clients included Hollywood stars and moguls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;18	But her so-called `` black book '' of clients was never made public ; the judge ruled the names of her customers were irrelevant .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;19	Fleiss was captured on video and audiotapes during a Beverly Hills sting last year and charged with offering undercover police officers four women for prostitution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;20	Two of the women testified under immunity that they were to give Fleiss 40 percent of their dlrs 1,500 fees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;21	One woman also testified she charged up to dlrs 10,000 for a night of sex .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;22	On the tapes Fleiss was heard boasting that her call girl ring catered to `` the top 1 percent '' of entertainment , corporate and political circles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;23	During the sting , Beverly Hills Detective Sammy Lee posed as a Hawaiian millionaire and spoke gibberish meant to pass as Japanese .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;24	Videotapes show him arranging to purchase four women for himself and three colleagues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;25	The women are shown in a luxurious hotel suite accepting money , discussing what sex acts they would do and disrobing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0571;26	At that point , they were arrested .
APW_ENG_19941202.0572;0	Maj. Rita LePage , UN military spokeswoman in Zagreb , Croatia , said that while promises have been made , no timetable has been given for the possible release of the Canadian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0572;1	Bosnian Serbs said details would be provided as soon as possible , said LePage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;0	As the scorched Achille Lauro has sunk into the Indian Ocean , a surviving passenger blamed the crew for dropping inflatable rafts on top of a crowded lifeboat , injuring one man who later died .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;1	The victim was one of two elderly passengers who died as a result of the fire on the Italian luxury liner .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;2	The 979 passengers and crew who survived were headed for three African and Middle Eastern ports aboard 10 rescue vessels , including freighters and U.S. warships .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;3	They abandoned the blazing ship Wednesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;4	The Achille Lauro was once a gleaming blue-and-white luxury liner that sailed around the world in 80 days .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;5	But it was best known for the 1985 hijacking by Palestinian terrorists , who killed an elderly Jewish American passenger , Leon Klinghoffer , and dumped his body overboard in his wheelchair .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;6	The terrorists escaped aboard a jet , but U.S. fighter planes forced the plane down in Italy and the hijackers were arrested and later tried .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;7	Eight people were injured in the fire , which began in the engine room before dawn .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;8	Lifeboats and rafts were launched and the ship was abandoned .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;9	According to passenger Geoffrey Wall , interviewed Friday by Britain 's Sky TV , one man was injured when crew members released inflatable rafts onto the lifeboat , which held about 35 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;10	`` It was tilting at an angle , '' said Wall , a Briton , describing attempts to lower a lifeboat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;11	`` They got it near the water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;12	They could n't lower it properly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;13	Then somebody hit the wrong -- I do n't know what it is that they release them with -- but they dropped two of these inflatable life boats on top of us , resulting in injury to one man . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;14	He said people gave the ailing man mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before a rescue ship arrived about four hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;15	`` We were in 100 yards -LRB- meters -RRB- or so of the rescue ship when he started to go ... Unfortunately , he died , '' Wall said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;16	It was not immediately clear if the man died of his injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;17	The ship 's owner , Naples , Italy-based Starlauro , had no immediate comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;18	Passenger Dennis Bassett , also told Sky TV that crew members did not alert all the passengers until only minutes before the order sounded to abandon ship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;19	`` Some passengers at 7 o'clock in the morning were still in bed , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;20	The ship 's captain , Giuseppe Orsi , was the last to abandon the ship , which sank Friday evening about 125 miles -LRB- 200 kms -RRB- off the coast of Somalia in about 14,700 feet -LRB- 4,450 meters -RRB- of water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;21	The liner fell to its left side and sank as an Italian tug began to pull it , StarLauro President Nicola Coccia told the Italian news agency ANSA .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;22	`` There probably was a movement of a mass of water inside , '' causing it to sink , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;23	`` She was hooked up to the -LRB- tug -RRB- Solano and in 10 minutes , she collapsed -- pfft , she disappeared , '' said Antonio de Rosa , marketing director for Starlauro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;24	He put the loss at dlrs 25 million .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;25	Starlauro had hired the seagoing tugs to bring the vessel home to try to save her .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;26	Italian coast guard Lt. Francesco D'Amico said the ship was unrecoverable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;27	Eight cargo vessels and two American warships , the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton , were carrying the surviving passengers and crew members to Djibouti , Mombasa in Kenya and Muskat in Oman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;28	Most were heading for Mombasa .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;29	The first ship was expected to dock in Djibouti on Saturday ; the rest were scheduled to make port on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;30	Alitalia said Starlauro had chartered two 747s to pick up passengers from Djibouti and Mombasa and take them to Rome , for travel to their homes in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0573;31	The planes leave Sunday and return Monday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;0	The United States and four European governments dusted off a rejected , five-month old Bosnia peace plan Friday , hoping the prospect of political ties to Serbia might lure advancing Bosnian Serbs into negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;1	Secretary of State Warren Christopher said it would have been useless to approve `` carpet bombing '' by NATO aircraft on Serb positions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;2	That , he said , would have meant a `` reign of terror '' and required hundreds of thousands of allied troops to force a settlement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;3	And to `` walk away '' from the 31-month war that has taken some 200,000 lives is unacceptable , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;4	`` The road will be very difficult , '' Christopher said of the renewed effort to stop the bloodshed through a diplomatic attempt to effectively divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into areas dominated by the Serbs and by a Muslim-Croat federation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;5	The hint that the Serbs might take a step toward a Greater Serbia was in the text of a one-page agreement adopted in a four-hour meeting with the foreign ministers of Britain , France , Germany and Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;6	It said that while preserving the `` integrity '' of Bosnia as a legitimate country , the Bosnian Serbs were entitled to seek the kind of `` balanced and equitable arrangements '' worked out by the Muslims and Croats when they formed a federation in March linked to Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;7	French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , who led a successful European campaign to persuade the Clinton administration to forgo heavy bombing as a strategy to stop the Serbs , called this assurance a matter of giving parties `` an equal opportunity . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;8	The text does not specifically call for a confederation between Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;9	A senior U.S. official said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev had argued for endorsing confederation but Christopher `` beat that back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;10	The agreement also carried a hint that the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in Bosnia , some 500 of whom were being held by the Serbs , might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;11	Their mission should continue `` provided that the risks do not become unacceptable , '' the agreement said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;12	The plan rejected repeatedly by the Serbs would give them control of 49 percent of the country , about two-thirds of the 70 percent they now occupy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;13	The Muslim-Croat area covered the other 51 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;14	This division `` can be adjusted by mutual arrangement , '' the ministers said , again suggesting the Serbs might do better at the bargaining table .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;15	However , Juppe and the other ministers stressed in a joint news conference that the Serbs must recognize the legitimacy of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;16	They emphasized they were now united in promoting diplomacy as the only possible key to a ceasefire and a peace accord .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;17	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , who chaired the meeting of the five-nation `` contact group , '' said the fighting in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia had reached an awful state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;18	He said the war could not be terminated through external military force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;19	Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will go to Belgrade on Sunday in pursuit of a diplomatic solution .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;20	Both stressed that while they would carry the joint decision with them , they would meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as representatives of their governments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;21	Michael McCurry , the State Department spokesman , said U.S. envoy Charles E. Redman went to Sarajevo on Thursday for meetings with President Alija Izetbegovic and other Bosnian government leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;22	He also told reporters the proposal Christopher had prepared for an international peace conference was being held `` in abeyance '' until the various consultations were concluded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;23	The meeting was held against the backdrop of a Bosnian Serb hammerlock on the mostly Muslim Bihac enclave and its 60,000 terrified civilians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;24	The prospect of the war spreading into Croatia also exists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;25	Christopher wants Milosevic to persuade Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to accept a ceasefire and negotiations with the Muslims and Croats by threatening to seal Serbia 's border to Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;26	Despite a promise by Milosevic to halt weapons deliveries , Clinton administration officials said arms were still getting through to fuel the Bosnian Serbs ' drive to gain more territory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;27	Meanwhile , a senior U.S. military officer , briefing reporters at the Pentagon in Washington , reported that NATO has begun planning for the possible evacuation of U.N. peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0574;28	`` We are doing planning at the NATO level for a withdrawal -- when and if that ever comes about , '' said the officer , who spoke on condition his name not be used .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;0	Led by Wayne Gretzky , the Ninety-Nine All-Stars arrived in Finland Friday night , ready to kick off a six-game tour of the Nordic countries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;1	`` I did n't realize how much I missed the game until we got out there and started fooling for a couple of days of practice and then going on to play yesterday in Detroit , '' said Brett Hull of the St. Louis Blues as the touring team went through a light workout prior to Saturday 's game in Helsinki .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;2	`` Hockey is just a part of our being , and we want to show the NHL that there is a reason for people to come and watch . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;3	A group of elite National Hockey League players chosen by Gretzky , many of them his best friends , will play Finnish champion Jokerit of Helsinki on Saturday and Ilves in Tampere on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;4	For Gretzky , it is the second time playing in Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;5	In 1982 he came to the World Championships in Helsinki and Tampere and emerged as the top scorer after a slow start .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;6	Canada won the bronze medal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;7	Gretzky is joined by some very old friends from the same season 's roster 13 years ago with the Edmonton Oilers : goaltender Grant Fuhr , defensemen Paul Coffey and Charlie Huddy and forwards Mark Messier and Jari Kurri .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;8	The latter has been playing for Jokerit during the NHL lockout , but received permission to join Gretzky and Messier for Saturday 's game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;9	Eighteen players arrived in Helsinki three hours late and took the ice immediately in front of some 2,000 teenage fans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;10	`` This group of players is the best you 've seen in a long time , '' Gretzky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;11	`` We all had an enjoyable four , five days already .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;12	We 're happy to have had a light skate tonight and we 're excited to play tomorrow . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;13	In Saturday 's game , the Ninety-Nine All-Stars will meet Finland 's top team , featuring Teemu Selanne , the Winnipeg Jets ' forward who was the NHL goal-scoring co-leader and rookie of the year in 1992-93 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;14	Gretzky promised a good show .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;15	`` I think the players we have together are not quite like an all-star team , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;16	`` We have players that play some NHL-style hockey , with intensity and force .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;17	We expect to hit , we expect to get hit . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;18	Gretzky 's team lost its first game 4-3 Thursday to the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League at Auburn Hills , Mich.
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;19	But the All-Stars were shorthanded , playing with only four defensemen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;20	Three Detroit Red Wings , Steve Yzerman , Sergei Fedorov and Paul Coffey also skipped the game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0577;21	Gretzky 's team will play a Norwegian All-Star team in Oslo on Monday before heading to Sweden and three games against Djurgarden of Stockholm , Vastra Frolunda of Goteborg and Malmo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;0	Marking a milestone in Taiwan 's shift to democracy , Taiwanese voters went to the polls Saturday in the toughest electoral test for the island 's Nationalist rulers in 45 years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;1	The elections are part of the reforms initiated by the Nationalists , who ruled by martial law until unleashing a bloodless democratic revolution in 1987 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;2	Voters were electing a Taiwan governor , mayors for Taipei and Kaohsiung -- the island 's two largest cities -- local councilors and provincial assemblymen .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;3	Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- , and results are expected about eight hours after the planned close of 11,825 polling stations islandwide at 4 p.m. -LRB- 0800 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;4	Newspapers predicted up to 70 percent of Taiwan 's 13.8 million eligible voters would turn out .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;5	The polls are a prelude to Taiwan 's first direct presidential election in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;6	President Lee Teng-hui 's prospects for another term will be measured by his Nationalists ' performance Saturday against the main opposition , the Democratic Progressive Party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;7	The Nationalists fled to Taiwan to escape the 1949 Communist takeover of mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;8	They still say they hope one day to reunite Taiwan with the Chinese motherland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;9	But the DPP advocates Taiwanese independence , something China has vowed to resist by force , and DPP successes Saturday could bring warnings from Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;10	The campaigning has focused largely on `` Tong-Du '' -- reunification vs. independence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;11	To the annoyance of the DPP , business leaders placed newspaper ads days before the poll warning that Taiwan 's dollar and the island 's standing with investors could plummet if pro-independence forces gain power .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;12	But the DPP may profit from a split in the Nationalist vote caused by the recently formed New Party , which quit the Nationalists last year after accusing them of abandoning the commitment to reunification .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;13	The DPP 's Chen Shui-bian is thought to be a frontrunner in the race fo Taipei mayor , while Nationalist James Soong has a 50-40 lead over the DPP 's Chen Ting-nan in the gubernatorial race , according to latest surveys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;14	Candidates held final rallies Friday night , including tens of thousands of cheering New Party supporters who packed Taipei 's municipal stadium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;15	The feverish election campaign , which sometimes resembled a carnival , is a sign of Taiwanese enthusiasm for democracy .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;16	Taipei 's streets and many of its taxis were covered with flags .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;17	In the last few days , campaigners lulled the capital to sleep at night with drums and roused it each morning with firecrackers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;18	Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung even complained that precious resources were wasted and that the campaign flags `` could have clothed 1 million refugees . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;19	Enthusiasm and heated debate sometimes spilled over into violence .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;20	Riot police were often at campaign rallies and 70,000 officers were keeping order Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;21	In a statement Friday , President Lee appealed for calm on polling day so Taiwan can `` welcome a new era of democracy for all . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;22	Other officials appealed to voters not to take bribes , a problem in past elections as well as this one .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;23	The DPP filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the Nationalists of earmarking about 150 million Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 5.6 million -RRB- to buy votes for Huang Ta-chou , Taipei 's incumbent Nationalist mayor , who is lagging in opinion polls .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;24	The Nationalists denied the allegations and appealed against vote-buying .
APW_ENG_19941202.0578;25	Government-controlled TV ran advertisements showing vote-buyers in handcuffs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;0	In a small , windowless room in public school No. 728 lies what 14-year-old Anton calls Russia 's `` future '' -- the school 's only computer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;1	At School 728 , after spending hours in poorly heated classrooms where they have to share tattered Soviet-era textbooks , students come to the `` computer closet '' to work on the school 's innovative on-line newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;2	Or to send e-mail to students in Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;3	Or to practice their French on an electronic conference with European schoolchildren .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;4	Like most of Russia 's roads , its information highway is still ridden with potholes and Soviet-style dead-end alleys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;5	Nevertheless , the next generation of Russian leaders is building its own onramps and starting to cruise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;6	`` The kids may not understand yet what this access , this communication , means for them , '' said Volodya Pilipchuk , the school 's computer adviser and a former 728 student .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;7	`` But 10 years from now , they will . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;8	Pilipchuk 's students have joined the millions of people -- from New York businessmen to human rights activists in East Timor -- who communicate via a worldwide web of tens of thousands of interconnected computer networks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;9	For Anton and his classmates , it does n't seem to matter that they were born in a society famous for restricting such free information flows .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;10	Or that some of their parents built careers on imposing those restrictions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;11	What matters to these kids is the computer itself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;12	Dozens of students huddle around its single screen during breaks , as Pilipchuk struggles to ration out computer time to eager users .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;13	The well-worn machine is especially popular among the students here , most of whom , unlike many of their U.S. counterparts , had never seen a computer before this project began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;14	Olga Galkina , the founder of the school 's on-line newspaper , says the project is aimed at `` helping kids understand their global importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;15	And ultimately , she hopes , these children may be the ones to guide the rest of the former Soviet Union into the information age .

APW_ENG_19941202.0579;20	The latest issue of `` Southern Zone , '' the on-line version of the school paper , included articles on topics from a nature reserve in Russia 's Far North to the music of David Lee Roth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;21	The issue was posted on the local network Glasnet , which is connected to the worldwide Internet meganetwork , allowing computers around the world access to the newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;22	The latest publication has evoked responses from users from Holland to Minnesota .

APW_ENG_19941202.0579;25	These kids are also proving that the information highway does not have to remain a limited access tollroad , affordable for only an elite few .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;26	The school 's computer , a standard IBM-compatible 386 with an internal modem , is on long-term loan from John Whitely , a sociology professor at the University of California at Irvine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;27	Whitely loaned the machine to Galkina for the on-line newspaper project in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;28	And Glasnet , a non-profit Russian computer network , donated an e-mail account to the school , bringing the total cost of the project to just a few dollars per year -- less than the budget for the on-paper version of the school newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;29	The project is a bargain even for public schools like this one .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;30	Russia 's cash-strapped public education system is struggling to support its 65,000 schools , where teachers earn about 120,000 rubles -LRB- dlrs 40 -RRB- a month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;31	School 728 is just one of several seeds of hope .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;32	At least 300 Russian schools have access to e-mail accounts , at least 250 of which are outside of Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;33	`` The numbers are still not high , for a country this size , '' said Galkina , who is now working on a project to connect disabled children in Russia to on-line services .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;34	`` But Russia , like the United States , wo n't become computer literate overnight . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;35	Computer literacy is still not a top priority for School 728 's administrators , who pay little attention to the cramped computer closet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;36	`` Yes , I know there 's something going on over there , '' said Nina Mikhailova , head of the student relations department , in the opposite wing of the school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;37	`` But it does n't concern us .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;38	We do n't use computers over here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;39	The administration may be wary , but its pupils are already making plans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0579;40	`` I want to be a programmer , '' Anton said , `` because the world ca n't survive without computers . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0580;0	Share prices rose slightly over the week on the British stock exchange .
APW_ENG_19941202.0580;1	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 16.2 points up over the week at 3,017.3 on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;0	In a small , windowless room in public school No. 728 lies what 14-year-old Anton calls Russia 's `` future '' -- the school 's only computer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;1	At School 728 , after spending hours in poorly heated classrooms where they have to share tattered Soviet-era textbooks , students come to the `` computer closet '' to work on the school 's innovative on-line newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;2	Or to send e-mail to students in Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;3	Or to practice their French on an electronic conference with European schoolchildren .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;4	Like most of Russia 's roads , its information highway is still ridden with potholes and Soviet-style dead-end alleys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;5	Nevertheless , the next generation of Russian leaders is building its own onramps and starting to cruise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;6	`` The kids may not understand yet what this access , this communication , means for them , '' said Volodya Pilipchuk , the school 's computer adviser and a former 728 student .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;7	`` But 10 years from now , they will . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;8	Pilipchuk 's students have joined the millions of people -- from New York businessmen to human rights activists in East Timor -- who communicate via a worldwide web of tens of thousands of interconnected computer networks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;9	For Anton and his classmates , it does n't seem to matter that they were born in a society famous for restricting such free information flows .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;10	Or that some of their parents built careers on imposing those restrictions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;11	What matters to these kids is the computer itself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;12	Dozens of students huddle around its single screen during breaks , as Pilipchuk struggles to ration out computer time to eager users .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;13	The well-worn machine is especially popular among the students here , most of whom , unlike many of their U.S. counterparts , had never seen a computer before this project began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;14	Olga Galkina , the founder of the school 's on-line newspaper , says the project is aimed at `` helping kids understand their global importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;15	And ultimately , she hopes , these children may be the ones to guide the rest of the former Soviet Union into the information age .
APW_ENG_19941202.0581;16	Much of Russia 's wealth of computer expertise has been lured to the West , leaving a relatively small cadre of dedicated but underfunded programmers to bring new technologies to this vast nation .

APW_ENG_19941202.0582;0	The United States has offered shelter in its refugee camps to up to 900 of the Cubans who have fled to this tiny British territory , Cayman officials said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;1	If the Cubans accept the offer , they would go to camps at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Panama , Gerry Maguire , the territory 's chief immigration officer , told the refugees in a meeting at their tent camp .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;2	The U.S. camps already hold thousands of refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;3	The Cayman refugees probably would n't be transferred until early next year , government spokeswoman Pat Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;4	`` It will be a significant weight off our shoulders , '' Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;5	The announcement came after months of talks with U.S. officials and a day after more than 300 Cuban women and children marched peacefully through George Town calling on the United States to let them in .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;6	Also Friday , the United States announced new immigration rules that will allow more Cuban families now sheltered in refugee camps to enter .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;7	Hundreds of Cubans fled here after an outbreak of hijackings and riots in early August prompted Cuban President Fidel Castro to allow people to leave by boat .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;8	President Clinton then barred the new wave of Cuban boat people from entering the United States .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;9	The approximately 1,150 Cubans now sheltered here represent about 4 percent of the 30,000 residents of this tourist resort and offshore banking center just 70 miles -LRB- 110 kilometers -RRB- south of Cuba .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;10	But the Caymans ' Cuban problem is far from resolved , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;11	Many Cubans have said they do n't want to go to Guantanamo because it 's too close to the homeland they want to escape and because a larger camp does n't appeal to them , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;12	Even if all 900 accept , that still would leave about 250 refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;13	The Cayman government has decided to grant asylum to a small , as-yet-undetermined number of Cubans who fled political persecution , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;14	Twenty-four refugees have asked to return to Cuba and will be flown back , probably within two weeks , Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;15	As a last resort , the Cayman government could repatriate those who remain , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;16	`` We 're really not heaving a sigh of relief .
APW_ENG_19941202.0582;17	Not for ourselves and not for the Cubans , '' Ebanks said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;0	A collector paid 6,325 pounds -LRB- dlrs 9,687 -RRB- on Friday for the only known letter from French author Alain Fournier to the woman on whom he based the heroine of his novel `` Le Grand Meaulnes . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;1	The 10-page love letter , written in 1905 when Fournier was 19 , was sold anonymously and bought by Roy Davids , a British-based dealer and private collector .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;2	`` Le Grand Meaulnes '' was the only novel by Fournier , who was killed in action during World War I -- September 1914 , a year after the book 's publication .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;3	The letter , with an envelope marked Y. H. , is addressed to `` Yvonne '' -- and her identity remains a mystery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;4	The seller of the letter was not identified .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;5	Fournier referred to her as `` my first Yvonne '' -- one of two Yvonnes whom he admired from afar , fell in love with and followed at a distance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0583;6	Both women provided aspects of his heroine Yvonne de Galais .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;0	Lucien Bouchard , the charismatic Quebec separatist who leads the opposition in Canada 's House of Commons , lost his leg to a flesh-eating disease but doctors said his life was not in danger .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;1	Bouchard , 55 , vowed to continue his political career , dedicated to making Quebec an independent country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;2	`` Mr. Bouchard has greatly improved over the past 12 hours , '' Dr. Patrick d'Amico told a news conference at Montreal 's St. Luc Hospital on Friday , a day after Bouchard 's leg was amputated .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;3	D'Amico said Bouchard underwent three operations since being admitted to the hospital Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;4	If no further complications occur , the doctor said , Bouchard should recover fully in about three or four months .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;5	Bouchard was struck by a rare disease known as necrotizing myositis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;6	It is similar to necrotizing fasciitis , the `` flesh-eating disease '' that caused alarm in Britain this year , but attacks muscle rather than connective tissue .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;7	Dr. Francois Lamothe , a specialist in microbiology who also appeared at the news conference , said the disease is caused by the streptococcus A bacterium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;8	It is fatal in 80 percent of the cases .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;9	The bacteria are common and infection usually results in sore throats or tonsillitis .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;10	But in about one case in a million , the bacterium turns deadly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;11	Bouchard , a former Conservative Cabinet minister , bolted former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 's government in 1990 and formed his own party .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;12	The new party became , effectively , the national arm of the Parti Quebecois , the provincial party dedicated to the secession of Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;13	In the 1993 federal elections , the Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats to become the official opposition to the ruling Liberals in the House of Commons .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;14	Few wanted to speculate on what the absence of Bouchard would have on the political scene or a referendum on independence expected next year in Quebec .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;15	`` Next week we 'll work with a great sense of solidarity , '' said Gilles Duceppe , the Bloc Quebecois whip .
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;16	`` We 'll just wait for Mr. Bouchard to come back . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0584;17	Prime Minister Jean Chretien , on a trip to France , expressed a `` sincere wish for a rapid return of his health . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0585;0	A collector paid 6,325 pounds -LRB- dlrs 9,687 -RRB- on Friday for the only known letter from French author Alain Fournier to a woman on whom he based the heroine of his novel `` Le Grand Meaulnes . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0585;1	The 10-page love letter , written in 1905 when Fournier was 19 , was sold anonymously and bought by Roy Davids , a British-based dealer and private collector at Sotheby 's auction house .
APW_ENG_19941202.0585;2	`` Le Grand Meaulnes '' was the only novel by Fournier , who was killed in action during World War I -- September 1914 , a year after the book 's publication .

APW_ENG_19941202.0585;6	Both women provided aspects of his heroine Yvonne de Galais .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;0	The Muslim call to prayer drifted into Hanna Hashab 's garden cottage as Yever Rainesch surveyed the living room decorated with crocheted doilies and plastic red roses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;1	`` How much does it cost to buy a house in the village ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;2	asked Mrs. Rainesch , who immigrated from Russia to this Arab village in northern Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;3	Rainesch was interested in property , but she was invited to visit Hashab 's home with more grand visions in mind .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;4	She was introduced to Hashab , an Israeli Arab , as part wide-ranging Labor Party attempt to change attitudes toward Arabs and shore up support for its peace policies , especially among young voters and immigrants from the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;5	Russian immigrants voted 2-to-1 for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's ruling Labor Party in 1992 , when it won a narrow victory over the right-wing Likud bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;6	With the next elections less than two years away , Likud has pulled even with Labor in recent polls and Labor leaders fear that one of Israel 's most powerful constituencies will swing the balance of power to the right in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;7	By then , the immigrants will make up 10 percent of Israel 's population of 5.4 million and could theoretically control 12 swing seats in the 120-member Parliament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;8	Aware of that possible electoral clout , immigrant leader Natan Sharansky says he may form a party to run in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;9	`` The immigrants in general feel frustrated and disappointed by the government 's treatment of their absorption , '' Sharansky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;10	`` More and more immigrants feel alienated and like a second class in Israel . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;11	Past elections indicate Russians almost automatically vote against the establishment and carry anti-Muslim sentiment from ethnic conflicts at home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;12	They are also generally suspicious of land-for-peace deals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;13	In an effort to change those attitudes , The Golda Meir Association , an educational institute close to the Labor Party , is taking immigrants such as Rainesch and introducing them to Israeli Arabs in their daily lives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;14	Earlier this month , 15 immigrants toured Kalansua 's mosque and flower hothouses , attended an Arab-style lunch and met with villagers in their homes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;15	Addressing the visitors at a trade union clubhouse , union secretary Asad Hadiga said : `` We are all Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;16	We support peace as the way of Islam . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;17	However , the Russians were not so easily reassured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;18	One woman said that since the bloody October bus bombing in Tel Aviv by a Muslim militant , she feels afraid whenever she sees an Arab .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;19	`` We Arabs are not terrorists , '' responded one middle-aged Arab in a checkered shirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;20	Another troublesome group for Labor are the 400,000 younger , first-time voters for whom Israeli control over the West Bank , the Golan Heights and Arab east Jerusalem is a fact of life .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;21	Israel captured the lands in the 1967 Mideast war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;22	`` They are vulnerable to right-wing principles of having political and historical , if not religious , rights to the land , '' said Stanley Ringler , a Labor official .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;23	In an effort to sway those voters , Labor started sending reserve generals and lawmakers to schools to explain land-for-peace policies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;24	Labor legislator Ori Orr , a reserve major general , kicked off the campaign this month by fielding questions at an Israeli high school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;25	One student questioned Rabin 's credibility , noting that during the 1992 campaign the prime minister spoke of holding onto the Golan Heights , but has since proposed a significant withdrawal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;26	Orr said Syria would first have to make concessions on water rights and its military presence in Lebanon before Israel would even consider giving back land .
APW_ENG_19941202.0587;27	`` If there are no answers to these questions , there wo n't be a peace treaty , '' Orr reassured the students .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;0	The Toronto Blue Jays said Friday they intend to honor Ontario law and wo n't use replacement players in the SkyDome if owners start the season without striking Major League players .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;1	Ontario Labor Minister Shirley Coppen said this week the province 's law barring replacement workers applies to the baseball team .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;2	`` As far as she can determine , the Blue Jays fall under this legislation , '' Blue Jays chairman Peter Widdrington said Friday by telephone .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;3	`` If it 's the law , we 're not going to try to obviate the law .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;4	We will follow the law . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;5	The Montreal Expos would be able to use replacement players because Quebec law applies only to unions certified in that province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;6	`` This is not a certified union and we have very right to do so , '' Expos president Claude Brochu said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;7	Major League players , upset over proposals to limit their salaries , went on strike Aug. 12 , eventually forcing owners to cancel the rest of the season and the World Series .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;8	Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington , management 's chief labor negotiator , said Tuesday that owners intend to use replacement if the union 's strike continues into the start of the season next spring .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;9	`` I do n't want to get into the whole discussion of replacement players , '' acting commissioner Bud Selig said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;10	`` That 's an option that at some point if we do n't have an agreement ... we 'll have to consider . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;11	Management lawyer Chuck O'Connor said the American League would have to decide how to handle the Blue Jays ' situation if other teams use replacements and Toronto ca n't play at home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;12	But O'Connor said management lawyers still believe it is possible to use replacements in Toronto .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;13	`` We have n't completely foreclosed it yet , '' he said .

APW_ENG_19941202.0588;15	Players and owners , who are n't scheduled to meet again until next Friday , both are preparing for the possibility of replacements .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;16	The Major League Baseball Players Association asked the U.S. Labor Department on Nov. 14 to certify the strike .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;17	If the department grants the request , non-U.S. citizens could n't obtain visas to play in the majors unless they were on 40-man rosters Aug. 11 , the day before the strike began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;18	U.S. Employment Services , a division of Labor Department , will make the decision after owners repond .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;19	`` The importation of foreign labor for the purposes of breaking a strike is fundamentally inconsistent with the code of federal regulations that INS has issued , '' said Eugene Orza , the union 's No. 2 official .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;20	Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations state : `` If the Secretary of Labor certifies to the -LRB- INS -RRB- commissioner that a strike ... is in progress in the occupation and at the place where the beneficiary is to be employed or trained , and that the employment of training of the beneficiary would adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. citizens and lawful resident-workers , a petition ... shall be denied . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;21	Labor Department spokesman Camille Johnston said it was unclear how long it would take for the agency to respond to the union 's request for strike certification .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;22	Some management officials , speaking on the condition they not be identified , have said in recent weeks that they expect Latin players will break ranks and report to spring training .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;23	The union says there 's no evidence to support that notion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0588;24	`` I have never heard anything like that discussed , '' Selig said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;0	Hundreds of angry Haitians menaced a neighborhood gunman after multinational soldiers freed him Friday , prompting the foreign soldiers to return to save him two hours later .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;1	Samuel Chery , who had terrorized a neighborhood in this Port-au-Prince suburb after the September 1991 military coup that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , had been held for nearly two months after U.S. soldiers arrested him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;2	Chery , known as `` Ti Samuel , '' was an `` attache , '' one of thousands of thugs who had Haitian military support to beat or kill Aristide supporters .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;3	He was freed by foreign troops at 2 p.m. , prompting uncomprehending screams from neighbors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;4	Hundreds of people gathered , grabbing sticks or carrying machetes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;5	They surrounded Chery 's home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;6	He had thrown rocks at them and locked his door .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;7	A Humvee carrying foreign soldiers arrived two hours later and took away Chery .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;8	Telephones were not functioning at the U.S. military 's Joint Information Bureau late Friday , and it was not clear why Chery was freed or where he was being held .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;9	Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark accused the United States on Friday of protecting members of the right-wing terror group FRAPH even after intervening to return Aristide .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;10	The Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti says it is converting into a political organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;11	A FRAPH leader , Emmanuel Constant , renounced violence at a U.S.-arranged news conference two months ago .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;12	`` The same forces that planned the coup '' are maintaining the level of violence , Clark told reporters after a five-day fact-finding mission of his Haiti Commission human rights group .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;13	`` The longer the criminals go unpunished , the more likely it is that the people will take justice into their own hands , '' said lawyer Michael Ratner , another commission member and director of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;14	The U.N. civilian mission in a Nov. 22 communique said `` a certain degree of violence prevailed until the end of October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;15	Since then , without having entirely disappeared , violent incidents are much rarer . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0589;16	The mission reported , however , that many people believe `` that the disarmament and dismantlement of groups which were part of the former repressive apparatus have been insufficient . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;0	In a small , windowless room in public school No. 728 lies what 14-year-old Anton calls Russia 's `` future '' -- the school 's only computer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;1	At School 728 , after spending hours in poorly heated classrooms where they have to share tattered Soviet-era textbooks , students come to the `` computer closet '' to work on the school 's innovative on-line newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;2	Or to send e-mail to students in Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;3	Or to practice their French on an electronic conference with European schoolchildren .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;4	Like most of Russia 's roads , its information highway is still ridden with potholes and Soviet-style dead-end alleys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;5	Nevertheless , the next generation of Russian leaders is building its own onramps and starting to cruise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;6	`` The kids may not understand yet what this access , this communication , means for them , '' said Volodya Pilipchuk , the school 's computer adviser and a former 728 student .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;7	`` But 10 years from now , they will . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;8	Pilipchuk 's students have joined the millions of people -- from New York businessmen to human rights activists in East Timor -- who communicate via a worldwide web of tens of thousands of interconnected computer networks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;9	For Anton and his classmates , it does n't seem to matter that they were born in a society famous for restricting such free information flows .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;10	Or that some of their parents built careers on imposing those restrictions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;11	What matters to these kids is the computer itself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;12	Dozens of students huddle around its single screen during breaks , as Pilipchuk struggles to ration out computer time to eager users .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;13	The well-worn machine is especially popular among the students here , most of whom , unlike many of their U.S. counterparts , had never seen a computer before this project began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;14	Olga Galkina , the founder of the school 's on-line newspaper , says the project is aimed at `` helping kids understand their global importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;15	And ultimately , she hopes , these children may be the ones to guide the rest of the former Soviet Union into the information age .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;16	Much of Russia 's wealth of computer expertise has been lured to the West , leaving a relatively small cadre of dedicated but underfunded programmers to bring new technologies to this vast nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;17	In the meantime , the kids are just having fun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;18	`` Look , I can type in English , '' boasted Sasha , a 12-year-old in an L.A. Raiders sweatshirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;19	`` Even my older brother ca n't do that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;20	The latest issue of `` Southern Zone , '' the on-line version of the school paper , included articles on topics from a nature reserve in Russia 's Far North to the music of David Lee Roth .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;21	The issue was posted on the local network Glasnet , which is connected to the worldwide Internet meganetwork , allowing computers around the world access to the newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;22	The latest publication has evoked responses from users from Holland to Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;23	`` The messages from the American kids are funny , '' said Alyosha , tugging on his long blond bangs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;24	`` Someone asked if Russia was bigger than California . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;25	These kids are also proving that the information highway does not have to remain a limited access tollroad , affordable for only an elite few .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;26	The school 's computer , a standard IBM-compatible 386 with an internal modem , is on long-term loan from John Whitely , a sociology professor at the University of California at Irvine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;27	Whitely loaned the machine to Galkina for the on-line newspaper project in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;28	And Glasnet , a non-profit Russian computer network , donated an e-mail account to the school , bringing the total cost of the project to just a few dollars per year -- less than the budget for the on-paper version of the school newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;29	The project is a bargain even for public schools like this one .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;30	Russia 's cash-strapped public education system is struggling to support its 65,000 schools , where teachers earn about 120,000 rubles -LRB- dlrs 40 -RRB- a month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;31	School 728 is just one of several seeds of hope .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;32	At least 300 Russian schools have access to e-mail accounts , at least 250 of which are outside of Moscow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;33	`` The numbers are still not high , for a country this size , '' said Galkina , who is now working on a project to connect disabled children in Russia to on-line services .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;34	`` But Russia , like the United States , wo n't become computer literate overnight . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;35	Computer literacy is still not a top priority for School 728 's administrators , who pay little attention to the cramped computer closet .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;36	`` Yes , I know there 's something going on over there , '' said Nina Mikhailova , head of the student relations department , in the opposite wing of the school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;37	`` But it does n't concern us .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;38	We do n't use computers over here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;39	The administration may be wary , but its pupils are already making plans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0590;40	`` I want to be a programmer , '' Anton said , `` because the world ca n't survive without computers . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;0	The Muslim call to prayer drifted into Hanna Hashab 's garden cottage as Yever Rainesch surveyed the living room decorated with crocheted doilies and plastic red roses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;1	`` How much does it cost to buy a house in the village ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;2	asked Mrs. Rainesch , who immigrated from Russia to this Arab village in northern Israel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;3	Rainesch was interested in property , but she was invited to visit Hashab 's home with more grand visions in mind .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;4	She was introduced to Hashab , an Israeli Arab , as part wide-ranging Labor Party attempt to change attitudes toward Arabs and shore up support for its peace policies , especially among young voters and immigrants from the former Soviet Union .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;5	Russian immigrants voted 2-to-1 for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's ruling Labor Party in 1992 , when it won a narrow victory over the right-wing Likud bloc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;6	With the next elections less than two years away , Likud has pulled even with Labor in recent polls and Labor leaders fear that one of Israel 's most powerful constituencies will swing the balance of power to the right in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;7	By then , the immigrants will make up 10 percent of Israel 's population of 5.4 million and could theoretically control 12 swing seats in the 120-member Parliament .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;8	Aware of that possible electoral clout , immigrant leader Natan Sharansky says he may form a party to run in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;9	`` The immigrants in general feel frustrated and disappointed by the government 's treatment of their absorption , '' Sharansky said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;10	`` More and more immigrants feel alienated and like a second class in Israel . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;11	Past elections indicate Russians almost automatically vote against the establishment and carry anti-Muslim sentiment from ethnic conflicts at home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;12	They are also generally suspicious of land-for-peace deals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;13	In an effort to change those attitudes , The Golda Meir Association , an educational institute close to the Labor Party , is taking immigrants such as Rainesch and introducing them to Israeli Arabs in their daily lives .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;14	Earlier this month , 15 immigrants toured Kalansua 's mosque and flower hothouses , attended an Arab-style lunch and met with villagers in their homes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;15	Addressing the visitors at a trade union clubhouse , union secretary Asad Hadiga said : `` We are all Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;16	We support peace as the way of Islam . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;17	However , the Russians were not so easily reassured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;18	One woman said that since the bloody October bus bombing in Tel Aviv by a Muslim militant , she feels afraid whenever she sees an Arab .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;19	`` We Arabs are not terrorists , '' responded one middle-aged Arab in a checkered shirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;20	Another troublesome group for Labor are the 400,000 younger , first-time voters for whom Israeli control over the West Bank , the Golan Heights and Arab east Jerusalem is a fact of life .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;21	Israel captured the lands in the 1967 Mideast war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;22	`` They are vulnerable to right-wing principles of having political and historical , if not religious , rights to the land , '' said Stanley Ringler , a Labor official .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;23	In an effort to sway those voters , Labor started sending reserve generals and lawmakers to schools to explain land-for-peace policies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;24	Labor legislator Ori Orr , a reserve major general , kicked off the campaign this month by fielding questions at an Israeli high school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;25	One student questioned Rabin 's credibility , noting that during the 1992 campaign the prime minister spoke of holding onto the Golan Heights , but has since proposed a significant withdrawal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;26	Orr said Syria would first have to make concessions on water rights and its military presence in Lebanon before Israel would even consider giving back land .
APW_ENG_19941202.0591;27	`` If there are no answers to these questions , there wo n't be a peace treaty , '' Orr reassured the students .

APW_ENG_19941202.0593;3	The decision announced in Washington by Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner comes one week before the Summit of the Americas , when 34 heads of state will convene in Miami .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;4	The policy would allow about 8,000 Cuban children and parents now held in Panama and at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to enter the United States if they have financial sponsorship .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;5	Cesar Odio , Miami 's city manager , said funding would be raised to cover relocation , education , health and living costs for the refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;6	`` We are working together with the government to see that ... they have full sponsorship and they are not a burden on the community , '' said Odio .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;7	The change will not affect the status of at least 20,000 adult refugees in the camps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;8	Odio denied a connection to the summit , saying negotiations had been under way with the federal government on this agreement since September .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;9	`` This has nothing to do with the summit , '' he said at a news conference early Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;10	`` And if it has something to do with it , so what ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;11	We want the children helped . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;12	The detention of the Cubans began in August , when President Clinton ordered all Cuban boat people picked up at sea to be sent to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;13	Other camps were later set up in Panama .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;14	Under an deal reached in September with Cuban President Fidel Castro , the United States agreed to give 20,000 visas if Castro cracked down on illegal migration from his shores .
APW_ENG_19941202.0593;15	The Cubans being detained were not to be allowed into the United States under the agreement .

APW_ENG_19941202.0594;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers and allow the free movement of some U.N. convoys as the chief U.N. envoy tried to salvage what was left of the ailing U.N. mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;1	Earlier , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building in Sarajevo just minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;2	U.N. officials said the missiles appeared to come from Serb positions , but the Serbs said the government attacked itself to cause trouble .

APW_ENG_19941202.0594;6	The plan would also grant the Serbs their main aim in the conflict : the right to ties with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;7	The Serbs on Friday released 70 Dutch peacekeepers who had been held a week , but more than 300 other U.N. peacekeepers remained hostage as insurance against NATO airstrikes .

APW_ENG_19941202.0594;9	Karadzic said the Serbs and the U.N. `` are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' but he issued a veiled warning against NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;10	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircraft and of NATO aircraft , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;11	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;12	Under current rules of engagement , the U.N. must request the NATO airstrikes , although NATO planes can defend themselves against attack without U.N. approval .

APW_ENG_19941202.0594;23	The war began when Serbs rebelled against a vote for independence from Yugoslavia by Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0594;24	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the war , and the Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0594;29	Akashi had more success than U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was rebuffed Wednesday when he tried to meet with Bosnian Serb leaders .

APW_ENG_19941202.0596;0	A U.S. Army inspection found numerous deficiencies with a chemical-weapons disposal plant only a year before its scheduled opening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;1	The report by the Army Inspector General found security gaps in and around the site in Tooele , Utah , along with an inadequate system for containing spills , and problems with tracking the deadly bombs and shells .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;2	An Army response attached to the report emphasizes that all the problems raised by the inspection will be addressed before the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility opens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;3	`` The Army is committed to ensuring that security , safety and environmental protection are not compromised at the facility . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;4	The report , the Army stated , was `` aimed at identifying , in advance , problems that must be addressed before the TOCDF becomes operational . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;5	The Washington Post reported on the inspector general 's findings in Friday 's editions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;6	Destruction of the vast U.S. chemical-weapons arsenal , a holdover from the Cold War , is part of a broader arms reduction effort and involves parallel actions by Russia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;7	After studying a variety of disposal methods , the Army settled on destruction by incineration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;8	Eventually the Army plans to operate nine disposal incinerators .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;9	They are part of a dlrs 10 billion Army effort to comply with congressional orders to eliminate the stockpile .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;10	Although plans for the incinerator are proceeding , environmentalists continue to criticize the destruction method , predicting toxic leaks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;11	Among other findings , the inspector general found that : -- Equipment such as fork lifts and cranes that will be used to move chemical weapons stockpiles are not marked with capacity ratings , creating the risk they could be overloaded .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;12	-- There are no final plans on what to do with the solid residue of incineration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;13	-- The Army has not yet settled on a system of marking and identifying each shell , bomb or other chemical-weapon container .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;14	-- During testing of one chemical-handling facility , `` a large amount of spillage was collected that exceeded the capacity of the secondary containment vessel . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;15	This spill was not toxic but once the facility opens , it will handle toxic chemicals .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;16	-- The perimeter fence could be penetrated by intruders either by cutting through or digging under the barrier .
APW_ENG_19941202.0596;17	-- Some windows and doors on buildings that will contain chemical weapons are inadequate and drainage structures and culverts leading out of the facility were not equipped with fences or grates to prevent intruders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;0	Canada will support former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to be head of the future World Trade Organization , Canada 's deputy prime minister said Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;1	`` We think Mr. Salinas did an incredible job in bringing the new face of Mexico to the people of the world , and we hope that he will have a chance to continue to do that as president of the WTO , '' said Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;2	Copps was here to attend Thursday 's inauguration of Mexico 's new president Ernesto Zedillo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;3	`` President Salinas will be known for bringing business and economic skills to a country moving away from government ownership to private ownership and I think that Dr. Zedillo will actually ensure that economic direction is shared by the people , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;4	The World Trade Organization will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT , on Jan 1 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;5	Most countries in the Western Hemisphere are backing Salinas to head the new organization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;6	Europe and its former African colonies are firmly behind Renato Ruggiero , a one-time Italian trade minister , while Japan and its Asian neighbors are lobbying for Trade Minister Kim Chul-su of South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;7	Copps also said she was encouraged by Zedillo 's promises to raise Mexico 's standard of living and to increase public faith in the Mexican justice system after a series of high-profile political assassinations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;8	`` Mexico 's had a rough , turbulent year , and I think he gave the right signals to the people and certainly to the international community , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;9	`` The message he gave yesterday was very clear : that he 's there to serve all the people , that he wants to rebuild the public 's confidence in the integrity of the democratic system , '' said Copps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;10	Zedillo will meet Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien at next week 's Summit of the Americas in Miami , Copps said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0599;11	The three nations will also discuss the possible inclusion of Chile in the NAFTA free trade agreement linking Canada , the United States and Mexico , she said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;0	An express train headed from eastern Hungary to Budapest derailed Friday and slammed into a station building , killing at least 24 people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;1	At least 60 people were injured , said National Police spokesman Laszlo Garamvoelgyi .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;2	The accident occurred at Szajol , about 40 miles southeast of the Hungarian capital , when the second car of an express train derailed and dragged three other cars off the tracks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;3	Some of the overturned carriages smashed into the station building , railway officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;4	`` There was a tremendous explosion , like the end of the world , '' a railway employee who witnessed the accident said in a telephone interview .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;5	People were still buried in the wreckage more than four hours after the crash , said the employee , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;6	State television showed pictures of battered and broken railway cars covered in bricks and rescue crews dragging bloody bodies from the wreckage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;7	Rescue workers said part of the destroyed building held sleeping quarters for railway personnel and their families .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;8	Defense Minister Gyoergy Keleti said dogs normally used to locate victims of mining disasters had found three children survivors who were dug from the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;9	The death toll was expected to go higher , with temperatures below freezing and some people still trapped in the wreckage , said Garamvoelgyi , the police spokesman .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;10	Doctors at a hospital near Szolnok , close to the site of the accident , said they admitted 26 injured people .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;11	Other hospitals also took in injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0600;12	The train was en route from Nyiregyhaza , about 100 miles east of Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0601;0	Gold in Hong Kong dropped U.S. dlrs 3.28 an ounce on Saturday , opening at U.S. dlrs 376.25 , compared to Friday 's close of U.S. dlrs 379.53 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;0	Boris Yeltsin was bad luck for Russian tennis on Friday , and Sweden 's Davis Cup team hopes to see him again soon .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;1	The Russian president and his entourage interrupted play at a critical moment in the tense fifth set of Stefan Edberg 's match against Alexander Volkov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;2	Edberg , energized by the pause , ended Volkov 's come-from-behind drive and led Sweden to a 2-0 singles sweep , winning 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- , 0-6 , 8-6 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;3	Magnus Larsson , ranked 19th by the ATP Tour , went on to defeat No. 11-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov in another five set thriller , 6-0 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 2-6 , 6-3 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;4	The losses disappointed the whistling , foot-stomping hometown crowd of 12,000 at Olympic Stadium , and likely doomed Russia 's chances of becoming the first unseeded team to win the Davis Cup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;5	On Saturday , Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy must upset the top-ranked doubles team and recently crowned ATP Tour doubles champions Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell to keep their hopes alive and send the best-of-five match to Sunday 's reverse singles .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;6	Kafelnikov accused Yeltsin of ruining Volkov 's concentration .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;7	Unlike other fans , a smiling and waving Yeltsin took his seat without waiting for the brief break when the players change sides .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;8	`` Do you remember what the score was when the president arrived ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;9	`` It was 5-5 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;10	Is there a switch then ?
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;11	What sensible person in a decisive game like this , with the score 5-5 , would do something like that in such a tense situation ? ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;12	Volkov , however , did not blame Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;13	`` I could n't have failed to notice when the president arrived , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;14	`` -LRB- But -RRB- I can say it interfered with my game as much as rain outside would have , because I had lost my serve by then . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;15	Edberg said he did n't realize until later that it was Yeltsin who had caused the delay .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;16	But considering the outcome , `` maybe I should thank Boris for coming in , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;17	Larsson said he hopes to see more of Yeltsin .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;18	`` I wish him welcome tomorrow for doubles , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;19	`` But maybe he can come in during the changeover next time . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;20	Volkov held match point on his serve leading 5-4 when Edberg sent a backhand down the line to send it to deuce .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;21	He went on to break Volkov and then earned the critical break in the final game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;22	`` Maybe he played it a little safe , '' Edberg said about facing match point .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;23	`` I took charge of the match in that game .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;24	I took a few chances and it paid off . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;25	After winning the first two sets , the seventh-ranked Edberg appeared en route to an easy victory .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;26	But buoyed by the flag-waving , cheering crowd , Volkov battled back in the third set , punctuated with a crowd-pleasing ace to take the tiebreaker .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;27	Volkov , 27 , then dominated Edberg in the fourth set with devastating passing shots and seemed set to take the match , serving for the victory in the final set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;28	`` I needed to kick myself , especially in the fifth set , '' Edberg said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;29	`` I was a little bit depressed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;30	I had the match in my hand and became defensive ... I felt I was getting closer and closer in every game in the fifth set . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;31	Friday 's loss was Kafelnikov 's first in eight Davis Cup matches .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;32	His only other loss was in his debut to Germany 's Michael Stich in March 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;33	Kafelnikov said he felt `` mental and psychological pressure '' after Volkov 's dramatic defeat , and said he said he injured his left wrist in the second game of the last set .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;34	He strained the same wrist last week .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;35	`` It did n't really hurt but I felt very insecure .
APW_ENG_19941202.0602;36	I could n't hit slices , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;0	Beth Daniel and Davis Love III , a consistently strong team in this tournament , shared the second-round lead Friday with Helen Alfredsson and Robert Gamez in the J.C. Penney Golf Classic .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;1	The two teams are at 12-under-par and hold a two-stroke lead in this event pairing LPGA players with PGA Tour or Senior PGA Tour pros .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;2	Daniel and Love teamed for the first time in this event in 1990 and won .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;3	The next year they finished third and in 1992 they were runners-up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;4	They did not play together last year when Love missed the tournament for the birth of his son .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;5	They shot a first-day 65 in best-ball play at Innisbrook Resort Copperhead Course and another 65 Friday in alternate-stroke competition .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;6	That puts them even with the 66-64 produced by Alfredsson and Gamez .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;7	One stroke back of the co-leaders are Amy Alcott-Robin Freeman and Laura Davies-David Feherty .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;8	Two behind are Liselotte Neumann-Tony Jacklin , Jane Geddes-Brian Claar and JoAnne Carner-Jim Albus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;9	`` Actually , I do n't think we 've played that great yet , really , '' Love said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;10	`` We 've had a couple of bursts , like one day here and one day there , but overall , we have n't played great . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;11	Friday 's round was produced with six birdies and no bogeys .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;12	The closest they came to losing a stroke was on No. 18 and Daniel saved par with a 6-foot -LRB- 2-meter -RRB- putt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;13	`` We both make a lot of birdies when we play our own ball , '' Daniel said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;14	`` Both of us hit a lot of greens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;15	So that 's a good combination .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;16	And Davis hits it long and I 'm fairly long for our tour .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;17	That 's a good combination , too .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;18	We have a length advantage which means we 're hitting shorter clubs to the green .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;19	That helps , too . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;20	Alfredsson and Gamez kept pace on the strength of eight birdies and one bogey .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;21	Gamez is coming off victories the last two weeks at Pebble Beach in California and at the Casio World Open in Japan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;22	He traveled 31 hours from Japan before arriving at the tournament Monday evening .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;23	`` I 'm just getting my legs back from the trip and it showed a little big on the back nine , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;24	Nonetheless , their 64 equaled the day 's low round .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;25	`` When we 've hit it close , we 've made the putt , '' Alfredsson said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;26	`` We 're having a lot of fun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;27	Usually during the season it 's a lot more serious .
APW_ENG_19941202.0603;28	This is a great break from the normal routine . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;0	President Clinton on Friday ordered that no U. S , government funds be spent on human embryos created for research purposes only .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;1	But Clinton did not specifically forbid federal financial support for research on human embryos that originate from in vitro fertilization -- the so-called test-tube baby technique .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;2	`` I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes , '' Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;3	His order Friday was far less sweeping than previous restrictions imposed by Presidents Reagan and Bush .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;4	`` I have directed that the National Institutes of Health not allocate any resources '' for studies of human embryos that were created for research purposes , Clinton said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;5	White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers , asked to interpret Clinton 's terse statement , said `` it should be interpreted very narrowly . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;6	Asked if the statement would permit federally funded research using embryos that were surplus from IVF clinics , she said : `` The president 's statement does n't outlaw that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;7	`` That 's the line that 's been drawn , '' said a senior White House official who asked not to be named publicly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;8	In his statement , Clinton said that research on fertilized human eggs `` raises profound ethical and moral questions as well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of federal funds . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;9	The report of the NIH 's human embryo committee said the research had the potential of finding news ways to correct infertility , to improve methods of preventing or correcting birth defects , and help combat cancer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;10	After studying the issue for nine months , the committee delivered its recommendations this week to another panel that advises NIH Director Harold Varmus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;11	That panel endorsed the recommendations , leaving the final decision up to Varmus on if , when and how the NIH would proceed with research grants -- until Clinton took it out of Varmus ' hands later in the day .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;12	In his statement , Clinton praised the work of the committees and said he understood how the research could make advances in in vitro fertilization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;13	He also said he planned to establish a bioethics advisory commission to further deliberate such issues .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;14	The advisory committee acknowledged that many people had ethical and moral reservations about its recommendation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;15	Under the recommendation , embryo research would be subject to strict controls , including limiting it to the first 14 days after fertilization .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;16	At that point , a fertilized human egg has grown to hundreds of cells but has not yet developed a nervous system , specific tissues or a human form .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;17	The White House announcement came as opponents of human embryo research , mostly groups that also oppose abortion , were gathering forces for a showdown in Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;18	`` Regardless of any potential medical advancements , human dignity must not be degraded by having life created in a laboratory dish just to have it thrown out with the trash when scientists are finished with their Frankenstein-type experiments , '' said Rep. Robert Dornan , a California Republican who promised to carry the fight to Congress .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;19	Richard Doerfinger of the U.S. Catholic Conference said his organization would support efforts to block any federal funding for the embryo research .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;20	Guidelines for embryo research were first recommended by an NIH committee in 1979 , but Presidents Reagan and Bush opposed it and the process withered .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;21	Varmus , who was appointed by President Clinton , revived the effort by naming the embryo research committee earlier this year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;22	Despite the lack of federal funds , clinics and universities that provide in vitro fertilization services have privately financed extensive research for more than a decade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;23	Dr. Steven Muller , president emeritus of Johns Hopkins University and chairman of the embryo advisory panel that studied the issue , said the committee received more than 50,000 pieces of mail , most of it protesting the research .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;24	`` The public has no idea what human embryo research means , but to most people it does seem terrible , '' Muller said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0604;25	`` The extreme high level of public ignorance invites exploitation '' by opponents to the research .

APW_ENG_19941202.0606;1	It was the first council veto in a year and a half -- and the first on the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0606;2	The resolution was sponsored by Islamic and non-aligned states to show sympathy for the Bosnian Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0606;3	Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0606;4	A Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto does not represent a split within the five-nation contact group pushing for a peace agreement in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0606;5	Hours before the veto , diplomats from Russia , the United States , France , Britain and Germany demonstrated their unity by endorsing a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0606;6	The last veto was in May 1993 , when Russia blocked its first resolution in nine years , killing a proposal to make all U.N. members pay for the small U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus .

APW_ENG_19941202.0609;0	The resolution would require U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia , the dominant member of Yugoslavia , and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0609;1	U.N. resolutions already ban all but humanitarian supplies from crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Bosnia , but monitors have been permitting shipments to cross Bosnia if they are destined for Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0609;2	With Friday 's vote , the veto has been used 281 times in the Security Council since the founding of the United Nations in 1945 .

APW_ENG_19941202.0611;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of peacekeepers and allow aid deliveries as the chief U.N. envoy tried to salvage what was left of the ailing U.N. mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;1	Earlier , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building just minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;2	U.N. officials said the missiles appeared to come from Serb positions , but the Serbs said the government attacked itself to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;3	It was yet another sign of Serb contempt for the peacekeeping effort , which has virtually ground to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;4	The Serb rebels have stopped U.N. aid convoys , attacked a U.N.-declared `` safe area , '' and taken peacekeepers hostage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;5	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher and European foreign ministers endorsed a U.S. plan for a cease-fire that would lead to peace talks in the 2 -LCB- - year-old war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;6	The plan would also grant the Serbs their main aim in the conflict : the right to ties with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;7	At the United Nations , Russia late Friday vetoed a Security Council resolution aimed at stopping Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;8	It was the first council veto in a year and a half and the first on the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;9	The Serbs on Friday released 70 peacekeepers who had been held a week , but more than 300 peacekeepers remained hostage as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;10	Akashi , who met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , said he was assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia would be released , Dutch and British supply convoys detained since Saturday would be freed , and Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in Bihac would be allowed to receive supplies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;11	Karadzic said the Serbs and the U.N. `` are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' but he issued a veiled warning against NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;12	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircraft and of NATO aircraft , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;13	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;14	Under current rules of engagement , the U.N. must request the NATO airstrikes , although NATO planes can defend themselves against attack without U.N. approval .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;15	U.N. officials fear that could escalate tensions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;16	Akashi had met earlier with Bosnian government and military leaders in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;17	Two wire-guided missiles hit the presidency building minutes before he arrived for the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;18	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic , an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;19	Three missiles hit nearby buildings while the meeting went on .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;20	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;21	The Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for not using force to halt fighting at Bihac , the embattled government-held enclave in the northwest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;22	Serb forces have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the `` safe area , '' and fighting continued there Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;23	U.S. Ambassador to Germany Charles Redman held talks in Sarajevo with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the U.S. peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;24	Redman helped draft an earlier plan that the Serbs rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;25	The war began when Serbs rebelled against a vote for independence from Yugoslavia by Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;26	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the war , and the Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;27	Following the secession since 1991 of Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Macedonia , Yugoslavia now comprises Serbia and Montenegro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;28	Serb nationalists in Yugoslavia , Croatia and Bosnia have pressed for a unified `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;29	The rejected peace plan denied Serbs the right to links with Yugoslavia as punishment for starting the war , but allowed Bosnia 's Croats and Muslims the right to ties with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;30	The old plan also granted the Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia -- a condition the new plan also contains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;31	Akashi had more success than U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was rebuffed Wednesday when he tried to meet with Bosnian Serb leaders .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;32	Boutros-Ghali said afterwards that intransigence by the warring sides might force the U.N. mission to withdraw .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;33	Seventy Dutch peacekeepers arrived in Zagreb , Croatia , after being released from a seven-day detention by the Serbs in eastern Bosnia , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;34	But Serbs continued to hold about 20 other Dutch peacekeepers , plus hundreds of British , Ukrainians and Canadians , at various points throughout Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;35	Machine-gun and small arms fire was reported on the outskirts of Bihac , U.N. officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;36	The heaviest fighting appeared concentrated around Velika Kladusa , north of Bihac , where Serbs were apparently closing in on the government army 's 5th Corps .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;37	The Bosnian Serbs , backed by Serbs from neighboring Croatia , want to wipe out the 5th Corps , which launched a briefly successful offensive from the Bihac enclave in late October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;38	The Security Council resolution vetoed by Russia Friday night would have required U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;39	Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;40	A Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto did n't represent a split with the United States and other Western nations which drafted the peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;41	There were also signs that fronts south of Bihac were heating up .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;42	Bosnian Croats , allied with Muslim-led government forces , claimed they captured three villages north of the town of Kupres in central Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;43	Croat militia and Bosnian army soldiers took Kupres from the Serbs last month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;44	Gen. Ante Roso , the Bosnian Croat military commander , charged that Serbs in neighboring Croatia had shelled his forces across the border , near the town of Livno .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;45	He said his troops returned fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;46	Karadzic claimed regular Croatian army troops were fighting alongside the Bosnian Croats and warned Akashi to get them out or `` we will be forced to declare we are in war with Croatia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;47	In Knin , Croatia , the Croatian government and leaders of the rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement that , if implemented , could lead to normalized relations between the two enemies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0611;48	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , and the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;0	Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution late Friday night aimed at stopping Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0612;4	`` We had no other choice than to vote against this draft , '' said Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;5	`` We hope that ultimately there will be a sound and balanced approach '' toward a political process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;6	Lavrov said `` a more untimely moment of this -LRB- resolution -RRB- is impossible , '' adding that Yugoslavia had closed its border with Bosnia and was cooperating with peace negotiators .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;7	Another Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto did not represent a split within the five-nation contact group pushing for a peace agreement in Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0612;10	Friday night 's veto was also an opportunity for Russia to show its muscle in the council .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;11	Lavrov has repeatedly accused the United Nations of a `` double standard , '' saying that the council has imposed sanctions against Serbia , but has ignored Muslim acts against Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;12	The resolution would require U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia , the dominant member of Yugoslavia , and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;13	The aim of the resolution is `` to totally shackle the Serb war-making capability , '' said Djibouti 's ambassador Roble Olhaye .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;14	U.N. resolutions already ban all but humanitarian supplies from crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Bosnia , but monitors have been permitting shipments to cross Bosnia if they are destined for Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;15	The resolution also called for the freedom of the 450 U.N. peacekeepers being held by Serb forces by requesting `` personal safety and unimpeded access '' for all peacekeepers and U.N. refugee workers in Bosnia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;16	Some 100 to 150 tankers filled with fuel are being allowed to cross the Yugoslav border and reach Serb forces in Croatia , said one diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;17	Croatian and Bosnian diplomats say the fuel is far in excess of humanitarian needs and is being used in the war effort in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;18	The ambassador of Pakistan , a co-sponsor of the resolution called the Bosnians `` victims of international indifference . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;19	Jamsheed Marker said his country had demanded a vote on the resolution because `` the U.N. can not stand by and permit this genocide ... -LRB- which -RRB- makes a mockery of what the U.N. stands for . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;20	Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced in August that the border with Bosnia was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;21	The United Nations eased its sanctions against Yugoslavia in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;22	Belgrade had supplied the Bosnian Serbs throughout the 21\/2 - year war with Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0612;23	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had seen armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .

APW_ENG_19941202.0614;2	The resolution was sponsored by Islamic and non-aligned states to show sympathy for the Bosnian Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;3	Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;4	`` We had no other choice than to vote against this draft , '' said Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;5	`` We hope that ultimately there will be a sound and balanced approach '' toward a political process .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;6	Lavrov said `` a more untimely moment of this -LRB- resolution -RRB- is impossible , '' adding that Yugoslavia had closed its border with Bosnia and was cooperating with peace negotiators .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;7	Another Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto did not represent a split within the five-nation contact group pushing for a peace agreement in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;8	Hours before the veto , diplomats from Russia , the United States , France , Britain and Germany demonstrated their unity by endorsing a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;9	The last veto was in May 1993 , when Russia blocked its first resolution in nine years , killing a proposal to make all U.N. members pay for the small U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;10	Friday night 's veto was also an opportunity for Russia to show its muscle in the council .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;11	Lavrov has repeatedly accused the United Nations of a `` double standard , '' saying that the council has imposed sanctions against Serbia , but has ignored Muslim acts against Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;12	The resolution would require U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia , the dominant member of Yugoslavia , and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;13	The aim of the resolution is `` to totally shackle the Serb war-making capability , '' said Djibouti 's ambassador Roble Olhaye .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;14	U.N. resolutions already ban all but humanitarian supplies from crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Bosnia , but monitors have been permitting shipments to cross Bosnia if they are destined for Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;15	The resolution also called for the freedom of the 450 U.N. peacekeepers being held by Serb forces by requesting `` personal safety and unimpeded access '' for all peacekeepers and U.N. refugee workers in Bosnia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;16	Some 100 to 150 tankers filled with fuel are being allowed to cross the Yugoslav border and reach Serb forces in Croatia , said one diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;17	Croatian and Bosnian diplomats say the fuel is far in excess of humanitarian needs and is being used in the war effort in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;18	The ambassador of Pakistan , a co-sponsor of the resolution called the Bosnians `` victims of international indifference . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;19	Jamsheed Marker said his country had demanded a vote on the resolution because `` the U.N. can not stand by and permit this genocide ... -LRB- which -RRB- makes a mockery of what the U.N. stands for . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;20	Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced in August that the border with Bosnia was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;21	The United Nations eased its sanctions against Yugoslavia in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;22	Belgrade had supplied the Bosnian Serbs throughout the 21\/2 - year war with Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;23	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had seen armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;24	With Friday 's vote , the veto has been used 281 times in the Security Council since the founding of the United Nations in 1945 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0614;25	The last veto cast by the United States was in May 1990 and blocked a resolution criticizing Israel for its activities in the occupied territories .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;0	Bosnian Serbs have promised to release hundreds of peacekeepers and allow aid deliveries as the chief U.N. envoy tried to salvage what was left of the ailing U.N. mission in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;1	Earlier Friday , two anti-tank missiles slammed into the presidency building just minutes before U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived for talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;2	U.N. officials said the missiles appeared to come from Serb positions , but the Serbs said the government attacked itself to cause trouble .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;3	It was yet another sign of Serb contempt for the peacekeeping effort , which has virtually ground to a halt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;4	The Serb rebels have stopped U.N. aid convoys , attacked a U.N.-declared `` safe area , '' and taken peacekeepers hostage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;5	In Brussels , Belgium , Secretary of State Warren Christopher and European foreign ministers endorsed a U.S. plan for a cease-fire that would lead to peace talks in the 21\/2 - year-old war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;6	The plan would also grant the Serbs their main aim in the conflict : the right to ties with Serb-led Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;7	At the United Nations , Russia late Friday vetoed a Security Council resolution aimed at stopping Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;8	It was the first council veto in a year and a half and the first on the Bosnian war .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;9	The Serbs on Friday released 70 peacekeepers who had been held a week , but more than 300 peacekeepers remained hostage as insurance against NATO airstrikes .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;10	Akashi , who met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at Serb headquarters in Pale , east of Sarajevo , said he was assured that Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia would be released , Dutch and British supply convoys detained since Saturday would be freed , and Bangladeshi peacekeepers stranded in Bihac would be allowed to receive supplies .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;11	Karadzic said the Serbs and the U.N. `` are moving fast to normalization of our relations , '' but he issued a veiled warning against NATO .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;12	`` We would like to see skies clear of our aircraft and of NATO aircraft , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;13	`` If NATO is flying around there is more risk of misunderstandings and incidents . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;14	Under current rules of engagement , the U.N. must request the NATO airstrikes , although NATO planes can defend themselves against attack without U.N. approval .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;15	U.N. officials fear that could escalate tensions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;16	Akashi had met earlier with Bosnian government and military leaders in Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;17	Two wire-guided missiles hit the presidency building minutes before he arrived for the talks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;18	One destroyed the office of Miro Lazovic , an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia 's collective presidency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;19	Three missiles hit nearby buildings while the meeting went on .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;20	There were no injuries .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;21	The Bosnian government blasted the United Nations for not using force to halt fighting at Bihac , the embattled government-held enclave in the northwest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;22	Serb forces have seized 30 percent to 40 percent of the `` safe area , '' and fighting continued there Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;23	U.S. Ambassador to Germany Charles Redman held talks in Sarajevo with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the U.S. peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;24	Redman helped draft an earlier plan that the Serbs rejected .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;25	The war began when Serbs rebelled against a vote for independence from Yugoslavia by Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Muslims and Croats .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;26	More than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the war , and the Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;27	Following the secession since 1991 of Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Macedonia , Yugoslavia now comprises Serbia and Montenegro .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;28	Serb nationalists in Yugoslavia , Croatia and Bosnia have pressed for a unified `` Greater Serbia . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;29	The rejected peace plan denied Serbs the right to links with Yugoslavia as punishment for starting the war , but allowed Bosnia 's Croats and Muslims the right to ties with Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;30	The old plan also granted the Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia -- a condition the new plan also contains .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;31	The Security Council resolution vetoed by Russia Friday night would have required U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;32	Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0615;33	A Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto did n't represent a split with the United States and other Western nations which drafted the peace plan for Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;0	Jose Montepeque scored on a header in the 87th minute Friday to give Aurora of Guatemala a 2-1 win over Real Maya of Honduras in a semifinal game of the CONCACAF Cup Winner 's Cup .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;1	Montepeque 's goal from eight yards in came on a cross from Juan Davila and beat defenseless Real Maya goalkeeper Juan Palacios .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;2	Aurora advances to the Sunday 's final in the Orange Bowl .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;3	The Guatemalan Cup champion will play the winner of Friday 's late game between Necaxa of Mexico and Lambada of Barbados .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;4	The CONCACAF Cup Winners Cup matches winners of domestic cup competitions in North and Central America and the Caribbean .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;5	Aurora took a 1-0 lead in the game 's 24th minute when Roderico Mendez scored from 10 meters on a rebound into an open net .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;6	Palacios was forced off his line to make a kick save on a 20-meter shot by Aurora forward Edwin Westphal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;7	The deflection went directly to Mendez , who calmly finished the scoring play .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;8	Westphal missed a chance for a second goal when he volleyed a cross from Julio Giron just wide of the left post in the 60th minute .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;9	That miss almost proved costly for the Guatemalans as Real Maya tied it two minutes later on a goal by Nelson Rosales .
APW_ENG_19941202.0616;10	Rosales played a give-and-go with Victor Zuniga and finished his chance from 12 yards past fallen Aurora keeper Edgar Estrada .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;0	Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution late Friday aimed at stopping Yugoslavia from sending fuel supplies that reportedly are powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;1	It was the first council veto in a year and a half , and the first on the Bosnian war .

APW_ENG_19941202.0617;5	Lavrov said that Serb-dominated Yugoslavia had stopped supplying the rebel Serbs in Bosnia and was cooperating with peace negotiators .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;6	Another Russian diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , stressed that the veto did n't mean there was a split within the five-nation contact group pushing for a peace agreement in Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0617;9	Lavrov has repeatedly accused the United Nations of using a double standard , saying that the council imposed sanctions against Serbia for arming Bosnia 's Serbs but ignored Muslim acts of aggression against Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;10	Between 100 and 150 fuel tankers were leaving Yugoslavia for Serb forces in Croatia , said one diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;11	Croatian and Bosnian diplomats say the fuel is far in excess of humanitarian needs and is being used to support the Serbs ' offensive in the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;12	The resolution would have required U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies from Serbia , the dominant member of Yugoslavia , to Croatia .

APW_ENG_19941202.0617;16	The resolution also called for the freedom of more than 300 U.N. peacekeepers being held hostage by Serb forces and freedom of movement for U.N. refugee workers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;17	Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced in August that Yugoslavia 's border with Bosnia was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting an internationally-brokered peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;18	In response , the United Nations eased its sanctions against Yugoslavia in October .
APW_ENG_19941202.0617;19	Serbia had supplied the Bosnian Serbs since they rebelled 2 -LCB- years ago against a decision by Bosnia 's Muslims and Croats to secede from Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;0	Bosnian Serbs promised Friday to release hundreds of detained UN peacekeepers , but there was no confirmation that Canadians were free to move .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;1	Defense Minister David Collenette said in Ottawa that Canadian officers in the former Yugoslavia could n't confirm the reports of agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;2	UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers held in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;3	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;4	`` We have no confirmed reports concerning Canadian detainess , '' Collenette said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;5	`` You ca n't be definitive until you know what is happening . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;6	He said Canadian military officers are monitoring the negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;7	`` We had understood that negotiations were becoming more hopeful and fruitful , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;8	`` You 're dealing with a conflict where there are a lot of turns . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;9	Whether the promises would be kept remained to be seen , as Serbs have repeatedly broken their word to the United Nations .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;10	Maj. Rita LePage , UN military spokeswoman in Zagreb , Croatia , said that while promises have been made , no timetable has been given for the possible release of the Canadian peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;11	Bosnian Serbs said details would be provided as soon as possible , said LePage .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;12	In Paris , Peter Donolo , a spokesman for Prime Minister Jean Chretien , said : `` Obviously we 're encouraged by the developments .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;13	We 're keeping our fingers crossed , but we 're not going to rest until our troops have full freedom of movement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;14	We 've been let down before . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;15	The Serbs have been holding about 400 UN soldiers as insurance against NATO airstrikes on their siege of the Muslim pocket of Bihac , a UN-declared safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;16	The Serbs released 70 Dutch peacekeepers taken hostage Saturday near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;17	The soldiers were in good condition , Dutch officials said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;18	The Canadians have been held for the past 10 days at various sites in Serb-held territory near their peacekeeping camp in Visoko , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;19	About 20 are at a police complex in the village of Illijas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;20	The rest are at checkpoints and observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;21	The soldiers are in radio contact with their camp and those at observation posts carry on their work .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;22	Maj. Dean Milner , the senior officer among the detainees , is able to drive around in his vehicle and visit his soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;23	The Serbs are allowing supply vehicles from camp to reach the soldiers with mail , food and other items .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;24	Akashi , the top UN civilian leader in Bosnia set out Friday to hold talks with the Bosnian government in Sarajevo and with Serb leader Karadzic in Pale .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;25	His mission started badly .
APW_ENG_19941202.0618;26	Three missiles hit the Bosnian government building shortly before he arrived .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;0	A coast guard spokesman Saturday expressed hope survivors would be found among the more than 100 people still missing from the ferry that sank after colliding with a cargo ship , killing at least 34 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;1	Rescue efforts resumed at daybreak , and the coast guard detained the freighter , the Singapore-registered Kota Suria , and its 30-man crew , which , though damaged , had helped the rescue effort Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;2	Thirty-four bodies were found and at least 451 people saved .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;3	The Cebu City had been carrying 608 people , said William Lines , the ferry operator .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;4	The cargo ship crew was unhurt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;5	The cause of the accident was not yet known , but the ferry 's owner claimed it had been rammed by the Kota Suria , which suffered damage to its port-side bow .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;6	The freighter will be held during the investigation , which will last for several weeks , said coast guard spokesman Lt. Comdr. Amado Samante .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;7	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the Kota Suria 's bow crashed into the Cebu City , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;8	He said ship captain Wenceslao Lampong and several other officers were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;9	Passengers , many of whom were asleep two hours after the ferry had left port in Manila , said they had no warning .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;10	`` I was jolted by the crash and I woke up , '' said Melissa Selosia , who was on her way to Mindanao Island , 780 kilometers -LRB- 485 miles -RRB- south of Manila for Christmas .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;11	`` I grabbed a life jacket and made for the upper deck and then I jumped into the water . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;12	The ferry was embedded in mud in about 14 fathoms -LRB- 84 feet -RRB- of water .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;13	Four teams of coast guard and navy men were searching the ship for bodies believed trapped in the cabins , Samante said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;14	About 50 coast guard , navy and commercial sea vessels were involved in the search effort Saturday , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;15	`` Considering that all -LRB- passengers of the Cebu -RRB- were wearing life jackets , we are hopeful to find survivors , '' said Samante .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;16	`` In fact , two of the survivors yesterday were found by fishermen near a coastal town . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;17	Seaman Angel Espidido , one of 27 coast guard divers who joined navy frogmen Friday in the dive , said there were bodies inside the cabins he could see through portholes but that the divers were unable to open the doors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;18	Seaman Hermogenes Guilaran said he recovered the bodies of two elderly women and a boy who were trapped at a railing on the side of the ferry .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;19	The 2,452-ton Cebu City had left Manila bound for the resort area of Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- to the southeast , a 28-hour boat trip .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;20	The ferry , usually used by families and small business owners , sank 30 minutes after it and the 12,500-ton freighter collided .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;21	William Lines said the Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;22	It sank near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941202.0619;23	The Philippines ' worst peacetime ferry disaster was in December 1987 , when 4,341 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .

APW_ENG_19941202.0622;1	Singapore 's 275,000 regular and part-time soldiers will soon be able to do all this and more just by using a credit-card sized card that will replace their military identity cards within three years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;2	Releasing the first such Singapore Armed Forces Card on Friday , Defense Minister Lee Boon Yang said it was part of his ministry 's move towards creating a truly `` intelligent organization '' by the year 2001 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;3	The Defense Ministry is the first organization in Singapore , a prosperous city-state riding a high-technology boom , to use the smart-card technology for such wide ranging uses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;4	The plastic card has built in processing and data storage capabilities that will capture vital statistics about a serviceman besides other useful information such as drug allergies or vacation times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;5	The card would be used like any other credit card by sliding its magnetic strip through a reader or slotting it into computer-linked machines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;6	In army units , the card will allow the booking of conference rooms and auditoriums , access to parking lots , unlocking doors , logging onto computers and buying drinks from vending machines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;7	In the future , it would also act as a bank charge card in supermarkets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;8	The card is also a portable electronic score card for physical fitness tests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;9	For example , soldiers would slot the card into a computer and start doing chin-ups on a bar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;10	The results will be recorded electronically and stored in a training and manpower database computer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0622;11	Singapore , with 3 million people , has 50,000 regular troops in the army , navy and air force , plus 250,000 reservists .

APW_ENG_19941202.0623;1	The issue of who was driving the car Thursday night remained uncertain after agents for the two other players -- Chris Warren and Lamar Smith -- contradicted police reports that Warren was at the wheel .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;2	Smith 's agent , Eugene Parker , said Smith was driving .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;3	Rick Schaeffer , a Baltimore lawyer and Warren 's agent , said his client was not driving and was not the owner of the car .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;4	Asked why police would say Warren was the driver , Schaeffer replied , `` The best I can tell you is that it was a misunderstanding . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;5	Police detective Ed Malkowski told The Journal-American the preliminary investigation points to Warren as the driver , but they are looking into the possibility it was Smith .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;6	Malkowski confirmed the car was registered to Smith .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;7	Warren , reached at home , refused to comment .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;8	Kirkland police said after the accident that Warren , a running back , was driving , had been arrested for investigation of vehicular assault and was released on his own recognizance .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;9	Detective Jim O'Toole said Friday there is `` reason to believe alcohol was involved . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;10	He said blood samples were taken only from Warren .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;11	Warren , 27 , was treated for two fractured ribs and released early Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;12	He was listed as questionable for Sunday 's game against Indianapolis in the Kingdome .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;13	Smith , 24 , a rookie running back , sustained a chip fracture in his spine and an ankle sprain .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;14	He was released from the hospital Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;15	Frier , 25 , `` almost certainly will be wheelchair dependent , '' Dr. Michael Schlitt told a news conference .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;16	Frier has no use of his legs or hands and only minimal muscle function in his upper arms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;17	He has a broken and dislocated neck between the fifth and sixth vertebrae and his spinal cord was severely injured .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;18	`` The likelihood that he will play football again is zero , '' Schlitt said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;19	`` The likelihood of walking is very poor .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;20	He 'll regain a little bit more use in the arms .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;21	That 's almost guaranteeable .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;22	But it 's doubtful that he 'll have completely normal function of the hands . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;23	`` He knows about his diagnosis , '' Schlitt said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;24	`` I 've discussed it with him .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;25	He 's depressed as most people will be after such an injury . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;26	Frier was Seattle 's seventh-round draft choice in 1992 and was picked up on waivers by Cincinnati that year .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;27	He played in 32 games with the Bengals before being released Oct. 13 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;28	He played in two games as a reserve with the Seahawks this season .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;29	`` There is a tremendous shock in the locker room right now , '' said Seahawks coach Tom Flores .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;30	Police Sgt. Mark Smith said the initial indication was the car carrying the Seahawks pulled out to pass in the left lane .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;31	`` Then , as they were entering the northbound lane , they continued on across -LRB- the lane -RRB- and hit the pole , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;32	He said there were no skid marks and it appeared the car was going too fast for the rain-slicked road .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;33	He declined to estimate the speed .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;34	The crash set the utility pole on fire and the players had to be pulled from the car by passersby and firefighters , he said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;35	Vehicular assault is punishable by up to five years in prison , although the standard sentencing range under state guidelines is three to nine months in jail , the King County prosecutor 's office said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0623;36	The charge alleges a defendant caused serious harm to another person as a result of driving a vehicle in a reckless manner or while under the influence of drugs or alcohol .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;0	ZFrom opening doors to logging physical fitness tests and taking in a bit of shopping in between .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;1	Singapore 's 275,000 regular and part-time soldiers will soon be able to do all this and more just by using a credit-card sized card that will replace their military identity cards within three years .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;2	Releasing the first such Singapore Armed Forces Card on Friday , Defense Minister Lee Boon Yang said it was part of his ministry 's move towards creating a truly `` intelligent organization '' by the year 2001 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;3	The Defense Ministry is the first organization in Singapore , a prosperous city-state riding a high-technology boom , to use the smart-card technology for such wide ranging uses .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;4	The plastic card has built in processing and data storage capabilities that will capture vital statistics about a serviceman besides other useful information such as drug allergies or vacation times .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;5	The card would be used like any other credit card by sliding its magnetic strip through a reader or slotting it into computer-linked machines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;6	In army units , the card will allow the booking of conference rooms and auditoriums , access to parking lots , unlocking doors , logging onto computers and buying drinks from vending machines .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;7	In the future , it would also act as a bank charge card in supermarkets .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;8	The card is also a portable electronic score card for physical fitness tests .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;9	For example , soldiers would slot the card into a computer and start doing chin-ups on a bar .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;10	The results will be recorded electronically and stored in a training and manpower database computer .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;11	Singapore , with 3 million people , has 50,000 regular troops in the army , navy and air force , plus 250,000 reservists .
APW_ENG_19941202.0625;12	Military services is compulsory for all males .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;0	Amid reports that detained Canadian UN soldiers may be freed by Bosnian Serbs , Prime Minister Jean Chretien said peacekeeping rules are changing faster than ceasefire agreements are broken in war-torn former Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;1	`` We went there to maintain the peace , but the war is still going on , '' he said Friday after meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;2	`` We 're playing it the best we can . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;3	Chretien said it 's time to intensify diplomatic efforts to end the war , adding that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe next week in Budapest will be crucial .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;4	`` If some initiatives are decided , it will be decided Monday and Tuesday . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;5	In Pale , Bosnia , UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said the Serbs agreed to release more than 400 detained peacekeepers , including 55 Canadians .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;6	By the end of the day , 70 Dutch troops had been freed but there was no schedule for the others ' release and in Ottawa , Defense Minister David Collenette said : `` We have no confirmed reports concerning Canadian detainees . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;7	Also Friday , Chretien elaborated on his idea of a free trade deal between North America and Europe .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;8	He told about 400 business people that improving trade links across the Atlantic is the best way to prevent trading blocs from withdrawing `` timidly into their own shells . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;9	`` This is the best way to energize relations between Canada and France , and Canada and Europe , and to fight the temptation of isolationism . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;10	The prime minister first suggested the idea Thursday while speaking to the French Senate .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;11	Federal officials said Canada has n't yet broached the subject with the U.S. or Mexico , its partners in the North America Free Trade Agreement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;12	Chretien said his new trade initiative did n't come up Friday in separate talks with Mitterrand and Balladur , which dealt mostly with the situation in Bosnia , in preparation for the meetings in Budapest .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;13	Canada has extensive trade and investment links with France .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;14	Two-way trade amounted to more than $ 4 billion in 1993 and French companies have invested $ 4.2 billion in Canada , including more than $ 2.5 billion in Ontario .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;15	French business executives expressed curiosity about Chretien 's proposal during a private lunch but did n't endorse or reject the idea , said Canadian officials .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;16	Chretien formally signed with Balladur a previously announced agreement that ends a long-standing dispute over fishing around the French islands of St-Pierre-Miquelon near Newfoundland .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;17	And the prime minister expressed relief that Bloc Quebecois Leader Lucien Bouchard was out of immediate danger after his leg was amputated to save his life from a deadly bacterium .
APW_ENG_19941202.0626;18	`` I hope that he will be back in good health within months . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;0	The Security Council late Friday night called on the former Soviet republic of Georgia and a breakaway province to press forward with peace talks and cautioned against a separate Abkhaz state .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;1	Russia has repeatedly urged the council to address the conflict .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;2	The council statement came moments after Moscow vetoed a resolution that would have limited fuel shipments to Serbia , a traditional Russian ally .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;3	The council statement said that last week 's declaration by Abkhazia 's parliament `` purporting to establish a sovereign Abkhaz identity would violate the commitments ... to seek a comprehensive political settlement . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;4	Georgia and Abkhazia signed a U.N.-brokered agreement in September that allowed for the return of refugees .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;5	But Abkhazian authorities have refused to accept many refugees , citing Georgian violations of a cease-fire .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;6	At issue is the plight of some 250,000 Georgians who fled Abkhazia and want to return home .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;7	The war in Abkhazia began in the summer of 1992 when Georgian soldiers marched into the Black Sea province to crush the secessionist movement .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;8	The fighting , which claimed 3,000 lives , ended last fall when Abkhazian forces drove out the Georgian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941202.0627;9	A truce , monitored by Russian peacekeepers and U.N. observers , is now in place .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;0	The United States and North Korea have wrapped up the latest round of nuclear talks on providing the communist state with modern nuclear reactors .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;1	`` The talks addressed complex matters and were serious and useful , '' said a joint statement after the three-day talks in Beijing ended Friday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;2	It was carried Saturday by the North 's official Korean Central News Agency .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;3	Under an agreement signed in October , the North is to receive two reactors in exchange for freezing and eventually dismantling its nuclear facilities , suspected of being used to develop atomic bombs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;4	It is also to gain diplomatic relations with Washington .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;5	The statement said the two sides reaffirmed their intention to meet the terms of the Geneva accord on the provision of the new reactors , worth about dlrs 4 billion .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;6	Under the agreement , Washington is to organize an international consortium to finance and build the plants by 2003 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;7	The new lightwater reactors would produce much less weapons-grade plutonium than the North 's present graphite-moderated reactors are capable of , experts say .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;8	The statement gave no further details on the negotiations , except to say the two sides agreed to meet again in January .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;9	South Korean officials say the talks focused on deciding the type of reactors to be given to the North and discussed such details as where they will be built .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;10	South Korea is willing to bear much of the cost on condition that it makes them .
APW_ENG_19941202.0629;11	North Korea reportedly prefers Russian or German models , apparently to avoid losing face to its capitalist rival .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;0	After spending hours in poorly heated classrooms sharing tattered , Soviet-era textbooks , students at public school No. 728 come to the `` computer closet '' to work on their on-line newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;1	Or to send e-mail to students in Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;2	Or to practice their French in an electronic conference with European teens .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;3	Like most of Russia 's roads , its information superhighway is ridden with potholes and Soviet-style dead-ends .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;4	Nevertheless , the younger generation is building its own on-ramps and starting to cruise .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;5	`` The kids may not understand yet what this access , this communication , means for them , '' said Volodya Pilipchuk , the school 's computer adviser and a former 728 student .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;6	`` But 10 years from now , they will . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;7	Pilipchuk 's students have joined the millions of people -- from New York CEOs to human rights activists in East Timor -- who communicate via a worldwide web of computer networks .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;8	It does n't seem to matter to these students that they were born in a society famous for restricting information .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;9	Or that some of their parents built careers on imposing those restrictions .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;10	What matters is the computer itself .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;11	Dozens of students huddle around the school 's lone unit during breaks , as Pilipchuk struggles to ration out computer time to eager users .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;12	Most of the students here , unlike many of their U.S. counterparts , had never seen a computer before this project began .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;13	Olga Galkina , the founder of the school 's on-line newspaper , says the project is aimed at `` helping kids understand their global importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;14	And ultimately , she hopes , these children may be the ones to guide the rest of the former Soviet Union into the information age .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;15	Much of Russia 's wealth of computer expertise has been lured to the West , leaving a relatively small cadre of dedicated but underfunded programmers to bring new technologies to this vast nation .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;16	In the meantime , the kids are having fun .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;17	`` Look , I can type in English , '' boasted Sasha , a 12-year-old wearing an L.A. Raiders sweatshirt .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;18	`` Even my older brother ca n't do that . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;19	The latest issue of `` Southern Zone , '' the on-line school paper , included articles on the music of David Lee Roth and a nature reserve in Russia 's Far North .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;20	The issue was posted on the local network Glasnet , which is connected to the worldwide Internet , allowing computers around the world access to the newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;21	The publication has evoked responses from users as far away as Minnesota .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;22	`` The messages from the American kids are funny , '' said Alyosha , tugging on his long blond bangs .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;23	`` Someone asked if Russia was bigger than California . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;24	These kids are also proving that the information superhighway is not restricted to an elite few .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;25	The school 's computer , a standard IBM-compatible 386 with an internal modem , belongs to John Whitely , a sociology professor at the University of California at Irvine .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;26	Whitely loaned the machine to Galkina for the newspaper project in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;27	And Glasnet , a non-profit Russian computer network , donated an e-mail account to the school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;28	The project costs just a few dollars per year -- less than the paper version of the school newspaper .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;29	The computer project is a bargain in a cash-strapped public education system struggling to support its 65,000 schools .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;30	Teachers in Russia earn about $ 40 a month .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;31	School 728 is just one of several seeds of hope .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;32	At least 300 Russian schools -- most outside Moscow -- have access to e-mail accounts .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;33	`` The numbers are still not high , for a country this size , '' said Galkina , who is now working on a project to connect disabled children in Russia to on-line services .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;34	`` But Russia , like the U.S. , wo n't become computer literate overnight . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;35	Computer literacy is not a top priority for School 728 's administrators , who pay little attention to the cramped , windowless computer room .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;36	`` Yes , I know there 's something going on over there , '' said Nina Mikhailova , head of the student relations department , in the opposite wing of the school .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;37	`` But it does n't concern us .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;38	We do n't use computers over here . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;39	The administration may be wary , but its pupils are already making plans .
APW_ENG_19941202.0630;40	`` I want to be a programmer , '' 14-year-old Anton said , `` because the world ca n't survive without computers . ''
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;0	Vietnam 's Ministry of Finance has raised interest rates on treasury bonds from 15 percent to 21 percent , to attract more capital needed for economic development , an official report said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;1	The three-year treasury bonds , which first went on sale in June , are available to foreign residents and companies with foreign investors as well as to Vietnamese buyers , the state-run Vietnam News reported .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;2	The ministry planned earlier this year to issue the securities only if they carried an interest rate of less than 20 percent .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;3	But a tepid public response to bond offerings so far has motivated the ministry to boost the rate to increase their appeal .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;4	Vietnam hopes to attract as much as dlrs 55 billion in investment , loans and foreign aid to double its national per capita income to around dlrs 450 by the end of the decade .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;5	The treasury bonds are aimed at attracting what foreign bankers estimate is some dlrs 1 billion circulating outside Vietnam 's banking system .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;6	Many Vietnamese are wary of socialist-era banks that catered historically to state-run companies rather than retail customers , and they keep their savings at home or buy U.S. dollars or gold .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;7	Separately , the International Nederlanden Group -LRB- ING -RRB- has received approval in principle to open a commercial bank branch in Hanoi , a bank officer said .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;8	The ING bank becomes the first from the Netherlands to receive such approval and brings to at least 12 the number of foreign banks with branches , or permission to open branches , in the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;9	ING , which opened offices here in 1992 , has no plans yet to apply for a second branch in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam 's business hub , said its representative in Hanoi , Nguyen Duc Phuc .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;10	Vietnamese authorities see foreign bank branches as one way to attract investment to the capital Hanoi and speed development in the north of the country .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;11	Citibank and the Bank of America , the last two foreign banks to receive approval in principle for branches , will open their branches in Hanoi as well .
APW_ENG_19941202.0631;12	The ING branch , once it opens , will cater to wholesale customers rather than individuals , Phuc said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;0	Russia believes it 's time to lift some United Nations sanctions on Serbia , its ambassador said Friday
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;1	Ambassador Sergey Lavrov spoke to reporters after blocking a resolution that would have severely limited all Serbian fuel and supplies from entering Bosnia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;2	`` Russia does not think it 's appropriate '' to pass such a resolution on the same day Croatia and its rebel Serb minority signed an economic agreement touted as a framework for normalized relations , Lavrov said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;3	The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity and reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb , the Croatian capital , with the Yugoslav capital , Belgrade .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;4	Lavrov also noted Serbia has begun to cooperate with the international community by supporting the international peace process and cooperating with U.N. observers monitoring the the Bosnian-Serb border .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;5	`` So , we believe it is high time not to reiterate sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , but to consider further ways of lifting some of the sanctions , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;6	`` We had no other choice than to vote against this draft , '' Lavrov said during the council meeting .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;7	One Western diplomat said the veto was important to Russians but will probably not get much reaction from Security Council members .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;8	However , New Zealand Ambassador Colin Keating was unhappy with Russia 's decision to veto the resolution sponsored by Muslim and non-aligned nations .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;9	`` We have no doubt that the consequences of today 's vote will be felt for a long time to come , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0001;10	Russia has been going along with the Western powers on most of the U.N. resolutions during the Bosnian crisis , despite its traditionally close relationship with the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;0	As their tiny island country is invaded by Sonoran troops , the Ginger Islands call on the United States for help .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;1	The situation deteriorates , crisis becomes conflict .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;2	Americans on the Gingers are evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;3	Air Force planes begin bombing runs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;4	Marines are ready to land .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;5	`` It 's a good , messy scenario , '' Rear Adm. Dennis C. Blair , commander of the Kitty Hawk carrier battle group said as the biennial Tandem Thrust maneuvers moved towards Saturday toward their climax off the real Pacific islands of Guam and Tinian .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;6	Blair said a major feature of this year 's exercises , which involve 14,500 troops , is a more integrated approach -- Navy , Air Force , Army , Marines , and Coast Guard are all participating -- made necessary by tighter budgets and continued cuts in the size of the military .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;7	`` We 've had a 40 percent budget cut , so we 've learned to look to other services for some of the things we used to do ourselves , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;8	`` Before , it was really a zone defense , '' he said , making a sports metaphor in which each player is responsible for only his own part of a court or field .
APW_ENG_19941203.0002;9	Nowhere is the new attitude of cooperation reflected better than in a cramped set of operations rooms in the Kitty Hawk , whose crew and air wing add up to 5,550 people .

APW_ENG_19941203.0004;2	The resolution was sponsored by Islamic and non-aligned states to show sympathy for the Bosnian Muslims .
APW_ENG_19941203.0004;3	Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .

APW_ENG_19941203.0004;12	The resolution would require U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serbia , the dominant member of Yugoslavia , and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0004;13	The aim of the resolution is `` to totally shackle the Serb war-making capability , '' said Djibouti 's ambassador Roble Olhaye .
APW_ENG_19941203.0004;14	U.N. resolutions already ban all but humanitarian supplies from crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Bosnia , but monitors have been permitting shipments to cross Bosnia if they are destined for Croatia .

APW_ENG_19941203.0006;29	The last veto cast by the United States was in May 1990 and blocked a resolution criticizing Israel for its activities in the occupied territories .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;0	A new drive to win approval of an old peace plan for Bosnia is under way with the united support of the Clinton administration and four European governments .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;1	`` The road will be very difficult , '' Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Friday of the effort to lure the Serbs to the negotiating table while they are on the march in Bosnia and after they repeatedly rejected the plan after its adoption in July .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;2	But the United States and its allies are counting on war weariness and a threat of tougher sanctions to convince the Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;3	Meanwhile , British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will go to Belgrade on Sunday to seek the help of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;4	American diplomat Charles E. Redman already is in Sarajevo , trying to line up the Muslim-led government of Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;5	It had accepted the plan , but the proposal now is being embellished with hints to the Serbs of securing political links to Serbia or control of more than the 49 percent of the country provided by the plan .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;6	Christopher said it would have been useless to approve `` carpet bombing '' by NATO aircraft on Serb positions .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;7	That , he said , would have meant a `` reign of terror '' and required hundreds of thousands of allied troops to force a settlement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;8	And , he said , it would have been unacceptable to `` walk away '' from the 31-month war that has taken some 200,000 lives and drawn the United States and its European allies into a sustained effort to end the bloodshed through diplomacy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;9	The plan was approved Friday at a four-hour meeting of Christopher , Hurd , Juppe and Foreign Ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;10	Unanimity among the allies was broken at the United Nations later Friday , however , as Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution aimed at blocking shipment of fuel supplies said to be powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;11	Islamic and nonaligned states sponsored the measure to show sympathy for the Muslim-led Bosnian government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;12	But Russia , a traditional Serb ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;13	While preserving the `` integrity '' of Bosnia as a legitimate country , said the allied plan adopted in Brussels , the Bosnian Serbs were entitled to seek the kind of `` balanced and equitable arrangements '' worked out by the Muslims and Croats when they formed a federation in March linked to Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;14	France 's Juppe , who led a successful European campaign to persuade the Clinton administration to forgo heavy bombing as a strategy to stop the Serbs , called this assurance a matter of giving all parties `` an equal opportunity . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;15	The text did not specifically call for confederation between Serbs in Bosnia and in Serbia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;16	A senior U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Kozyrev had argued for endorsing confederation but that Christopher `` beat that back . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;17	The agreement also carried a hint that the 24,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops now in Bosnia , some 500 of whom were being held by the Serbs , might be withdrawn .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;18	Their mission should continue `` provided that the risks do not become unacceptable , '' the agreement said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;19	The plan rejected repeatedly by the Serbs would give them control of 49 percent of the country , about two-thirds of the 70 percent they now occupy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;20	The Muslim-Croat area covered the other 51 percent .
APW_ENG_19941203.0007;21	This division `` can be adjusted by mutual arrangement , '' the foreign ministers said , again suggesting the Serbs might do better at the bargaining table .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;0	Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution late Friday aimed at stopping Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .

APW_ENG_19941203.0008;24	Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced in August that the border with Bosnia was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;25	The United Nations eased its sanctions against Yugoslavia in October .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;26	Belgrade had supplied the Bosnian Serbs throughout the 21\/2 - year war with Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;27	Classified U.N. reports shown to The Associated Press in Sarajevo say that U.N. observers had seen armed men crossing the border between Serb-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia in vehicles with Belgrade licenses .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;28	With Friday 's vote , the veto has been used 281 times in the Security Council since the founding of the United Nations in 1945 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0008;29	The last veto cast by the United States was in May 1990 and blocked a resolution criticizing Israel for its activities in the occupied territories .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;0	A pre-trial hearing for a man accused of murdering seven backpackers has so far turned up circumstantial evidence but no direct proof placing him at the scene of the crimes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;1	Friends and family members of the victims gave tearful testimony in Campbelltown Local Court this past week , describing the last time they saw or heard from their loved ones .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;2	They also identified camping equipment police found in the home of one of Milat 's brothers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;3	A coworker and the ex-wife of the defendant , Ivan Milat , also testified about hunting , his love for guns and the state forest where the bodies were found .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;4	Milat is accused of shooting and stabbing the Australian , British and German backpackers and burying their bodies in shallow graves in Belanglo State Forest , southwest of Sydney .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;5	Their bodies were found between September 1992 and November 1993 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;6	Charged with murder , attempted murder , armed robbery and firearms offenses , Milat faces up to life imprisonment .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;7	Milat secured the services of a new barrister , two weeks after sacking his previous chief counsel .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;8	The New South Wales Supreme Court gave permission for Terry Martin , a Queensland barrister , to practice in the state and represent Milat .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;9	On Monday , before the ruling , Milat sat alone .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;10	`` I ca n't defend myself .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;11	... I 'm a roadworker , not a lawyer , '' Milat told Magistrate Michael Price .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;12	`` I 'm being framed here for seven murders . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;13	During testimony later in the week , Stephen Wright of England , identified with `` no doubt '' a tent found at one of Milat 's brothers as the one he gave British travelers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;14	The tent still had a hole Wright said he made accidentally with a knife while touring Australia in 1992 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;15	The parents and friends of Walters and Clarke broke down in tears during testimony by Milat 's ex-wife .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;16	She recalled her seven-year relationship with Milat and said he kept firearms and other weapons and often carried a revolver in his sock .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;17	`` Ivan was gun crazy with his firearms , '' said the woman who has requested her name not be used .
APW_ENG_19941203.0009;18	Milat was charged in May with murdering Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist , both 19 ; German backpackers Simone Schmidl , 21 , Gabor Neugebauer , 21 , and Anja Habschied , 20 ; and British backpackers Clarke , 21 , and Walters , 22 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;0	As their tiny island country is invaded by Sonoran troops , the Ginger Islands call on the United States for help .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;1	The situation deteriorates , crisis becomes conflict .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;2	Americans on the Gingers are evacuated .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;3	Air Force planes begin bombing runs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;4	Marines are ready to land .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;5	`` It 's a good , messy scenario , '' Rear Adm. Dennis C. Blair , commander of the Kitty Hawk carrier battle group said as the biennial Tandem Thrust maneuvers moved Saturday toward their climax off the real Pacific islands of Guam and Tinian .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;6	Blair said a major feature of this year 's exercises , which involve 14,500 troops , is a more integrated approach -- Navy , Air Force , Army , Marines , and Coast Guard are all participating -- made necessary by tighter budgets and continued cuts in the size of the military .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;7	`` We 've had a 40 percent budget cut , so we 've learned to look to other services for some of the things we used to do ourselves , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;8	`` Before , it was really a zone defense , '' he said , making a sports metaphor in which each player is responsible for only his own part of a court or field .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;9	Nowhere is the new attitude of cooperation reflected better than in a cramped set of operations rooms in the Kitty Hawk , whose crew and air wing add up to 5,550 people .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;10	Shoulder to shoulder , specialists from the different branches of the military coordinate their air missions against the imaginary Sonorans .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;11	From that command center , crammed to overflowing with maps , message boards and state-of-the-art computers , roughly 210 sorties are planned each day , some dropping live ordnance on a small island firing range on the maneuver 's parameters .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;12	`` So far , it 's been working magnificently well , '' said Read Adm. Herb Brown , head of the exercise 's joint air command .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;13	Navy spokesmen stressed that the exercises , which began Nov. 26 and end Dec. 8 , are not planned as a preparation for hostilities with any particular nation but are instead a composite of potential threats and responses .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;14	They have also been designed to emphasize the kind of hot-spot tensions that have become more common since the end of the Cold War .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;15	As the maneuvers progress , simulated political and diplomatic activities are also underway , giving an additional dimension of uncertainty to the mission .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;16	`` Right now , we are just trying to demonstrate to the opposition our presence , '' said Air Force Col. Ed Allen , deputy chief of the maneuver 's joint air command .
APW_ENG_19941203.0010;17	`` We are hoping the government of Sonora will back down . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;0	Detectives probing a spy ring that stole secrets of India 's space program have arrested a businessman , taking the number of people jailed in the case to six , newspapers reported Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;1	Sudhir Kumar Sharma , based in the southern city of Bangalore , where the Indian Space Research Organization is located , was arrested Thursday , The Times of India said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;2	Sharma 's arrest came a day after police picked up Nambi Narayanan , a rocket scientist who helped develop engines for launching satellites and missiles .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;3	Narayanan was the second space expert to be accused in the spy case exposed after the Oct. 20 arrest of a woman who allegedly seduced scientists and blackmailed them to give her designs of rocket engines .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;4	Both arrests were made in Trivandrum on India 's southern coast , close to a small town where the liquid propulsion laboratory that Narayanan headed is located .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;5	Newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying the ring was working for Pakistan , India 's arch-rival .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;6	Pakistan has denied it was involved .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;7	Police in the southern state of Kerala , where many other space laboratories are located , began investigating the spy ring after arresting Mariam Rasheda , a citizen of the Maldives , the reports said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;8	Her interrogation led to the arrests of rocket expert D. Sasikumaran ; another Maldivian woman , Fousiya Hassan ; and K. Chandrashekaran , who claimed to represent the Russian space company Glavkosmos .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;9	Both India and Pakistan , who have fought three wars since 1947 , are believed capable of producing nuclear weapons .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;10	India is developing its own weapons delivery system , while Pakistan buys M-11 missiles from China .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;11	Indian scientists have been developing rockets to launch communications satellites since 1979 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;12	But the space laboratories also are involved in developing missile technology and have come under pressure from Western countries .
APW_ENG_19941203.0011;13	In 1992 , Russia 's Glavkosmos was forced to cancel a deal to supply rocket engines to India under pressure from Washington .
APW_ENG_19941203.0012;0	American tennis star Jennifer Capriati will continue her comeback by playing in the Australian Open championship in Melbourne from Jan. 16-30 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0012;1	Australian Open tournament director Paul McNamee , who formerly coached Capriati , said the 18-year-old , who missed most of last season after personal problems including an arrest on misdemeanor drug charges , is also planning to play in the New South Wales Open preparatory tournament in Sydney from Jan. 9 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0012;2	`` Jen is just such an exciting talent , it is going to be great to see her , '' McNamee said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0012;3	`` She loves Australia and feels very comfortable here .
APW_ENG_19941203.0012;4	It 's great for women 's tennis to have her back . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;0	President Clinton voiced strong support Friday for appointment of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gotari to head the new World Trade Organization .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;1	The organization will administer new international trade rules established under GATT , the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;2	U.S. participation in the trade pact got final approval from Congress this week .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;3	A number of candidates for the trade post are expected to be offered , including some from Europe and South Korea .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;4	But the White House said Clinton believes Salinas , who has just completed a six-year term as Mexico 's president , is `` extraordinarily well qualified to take on the challenges facing the world trading system . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;5	A White House statement noted that Salinas is the only candidate who has served as a head of state and said he has a strong background in internal economics .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;6	`` He would bring to the WTO a wealth of experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing country , '' the White House statement said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;7	`` As Mexico 's president for six years , President Salinas led his country through a successful process of economic reform and trade liberalization , '' it said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0013;8	`` The president believe he deserves widespread support . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;0	Pakistan knows exactly what it must do to defeat defending champion the Netherlands in Sunday 's final of the World Cup field hockey tournament .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;1	Pakistan needs to penetrate the Dutch defense with its own free-flowing attacks and to avoid conceding any penalty corners .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;2	Easier said than done .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;3	The Dutch have been ruthless from short corners throughout the two-week tournament .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;4	Twelve of their 24 goals have come from set piece plays -- at which Floris Jan Bovelander and Taco van den Honert are devastating .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;5	`` Their penalty corners are certainly better than ours , so we 'll have to be certain not to give them too many opportunities , '' said Pakistan manager Abdul Rashid .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;6	`` But if we play our normal game I believe we can beat them . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;7	Pakistan is a three-time winner of the World Cup but faces a Dutch side that is unbeaten in its last 27 games .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;8	Coach Roelant Oltmans led the Dutch women to victory in the World Cup in Sydney four years ago and is looking to complete a double triumph Down Under .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;9	He rejects the perception the Netherlands is a `` short corner team . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;10	`` We have the best short corner specialist in the world in Bovelander , but we have scored 12 goals from the field here , '' Oltmans said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;11	`` We certainly do n't play only for short corners . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;12	The final is a repeat of the 1990 final , in which the Netherlands beat the host nation 3-1 in front of a 65,000 crowd in Lahore .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;13	`` That makes it special , '' said Oltmans .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;14	Bovelander scored twice in the 1990 final and also set up this final appearance with two penalty corner strikes as the Dutch downed top seeded Australia 3-1 in their semifinal on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;15	The Dutch played with tactical awareness in that game , depriving the Australian inners of space and stretching the ball wide when they attacked .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;16	`` I think we 're still improving and still have to improve some more , '' said Oltmans .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;17	`` How your forwards play comes down to how they are fed by the midfield .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;18	`` If we can feed our forwards very quickly , which at the moment happens probably only one or two times a game , we can score more goals . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;19	Pakistan 's hopes rest largely on captain and midfielder Shahbaz Ahmed , who has been troubled by a hamstring injury over the past week but still played well in Friday 's semifinal victory over Germany .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;20	`` It is always very hard to play the Netherlands and we know we ca n't afford to give them penalty corners , '' Shahbaz said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;21	After 10 years without a major title , the Pakistanis won this year 's Champions Trophy in March , but then failed -- for the first time -- to make the final of the Asian Games .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;22	In matches played Saturday , India got a 45th minute goal from Mukesh Kumar and defeated England 1-0 in the game to decide fifth and sixth places .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;23	Argentina drew 3-3 with South Korea but then won a penalty shootout 5-3 to seal seventh place in the 12-nation tournament .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;24	In play-offs to decide other placings , Spain drew 1-1 with Belgium and then won 8-7 on penalty strokes and South Africa beat Belarus 3-2 when captain Wayne Graham pounced on a penalty corner rebound with 37 seconds remaining .
APW_ENG_19941203.0014;25	Spain and South Africa now will contest 9th and 10th place on Sunday and Belgium and Belarus will play-off for 11th and 12th .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;0	The Washington Bullets finally won their first game with Chris Webber in the lineup , getting 18 points and nine rebounds from their new forward in a 115-104 victory over Detroit on Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;1	Webber , who temporarily left the game in the third quarter to receive three stitches for a cut over his right eye , made eight of 11 shots in 34 minutes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;2	He also had three assists , four steals and three blocks .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;3	The Bullets were 0-4 since Webber joined the team after being obtained in a trade with Golden State .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;4	Calbert Cheaney scored 19 for the Bullets , who rallied from a 15-point deficit .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;5	Grant Hill scored 28 and Joe Dumars 19 for the Pistons , who have lost five of seven overall and four straight on the road .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;6	BOSTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Phoenix overcame a 22-point second-quarter deficit and a sensational second half by Dominique Wilkins to beat Boston .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;7	Wilkins , who hit five of 13 shots in the first half , made 10 of his first 11 in the second half .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;8	His last basket , a 16-foot fallaway , gave him 34 points and the Celtics a 100-97 lead with 1:47 left , but the Suns scored the next 10 points .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;9	Danny Manning 's three-point play and layup started the 10-0 run and put Phoenix ahead to stay , 102-100 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;10	The Suns , who won for the ninth time in 11 games , were led by Dan Majerle with 21 points .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;11	MIAMI -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Glen Rice matched his season high with 34 points and Kevin Willis scored a season-high 31 , boosting Miami over New Jersey .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;12	Rice hit 14 of his 18 shots , and Willis also grabbed 17 rebounds , the most since he came to Miami on Nov. 7 in a trade from the Atlanta Hawks .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;13	Kenny Anderson paced New Jersey with 16 points and 13 assists , but the Nets played without Derrick Coleman , their leading scorer and rebounder , who was out with a sprained right wrist .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;14	PHILADELPHIA -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Willie Burton had 25 points and Clarence Weatherspoon scored 12 of his 18 points in the final period , helping Philadelphia defeat Sacramento .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;15	The teams were tied 69-69 entering the fourth quarter before Weatherspoon scored six points in a 15-8 run to give the 76ers an 84-77 lead .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;16	Philadelphia still led 88-81 with 3:32 remaining , but the Kings scored five straight points to pull to 88-86 with 2:22 to go .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;17	But Shawn Bradley 's follow-up basket and Weatherspoon 's dunk built Philadelphia 's lead to 92-86 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;18	The Kings ' Mitch Richmond led all scorers with 30 points , but he had eight turnovers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;19	ORLANDO , Fla. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 38 points and Anfernee Hardaway 33 as Orlando dominated New York in a reversal of one of the Magic 's two losses this season .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;20	The triumph was the ninth straight for Orlando , a franchise record .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;21	O'Neal and Hardaway were so effective that with one minute left in the third quarter the Knicks had 68 points and Orlando 's dynamic duo had 64 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;22	Both players sat out much of the fourth quarter , while reserves finished the rout .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;23	Patrick Ewing led the Knicks , who never led , with 15 points .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;24	CHICAGO -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Stacey Augmon scored 20 points and Mookie Blaylock 's hustle set up a big 3-pointer by Craig Ehlo with 2:41 to play as Atlanta defeated Chicago .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;25	It was 73-73 before the Hawks scored the next eight points .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;26	Augmon made four free throws during that stretch , but it was Blaylock 's ability to chase down a rebound after a missed shot by Augmon that put Atlanta in control .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;27	Blaylock kept the ball from going out of bounds and the Hawks got the ball to Ehlo , whose 3-pointer gave them a 79-73 lead .
APW_ENG_19941203.0015;28	The Bulls got no closer than five points the rest of the way .

APW_ENG_19941203.0016;0	Greg Chappell has warned his Australia A team that it can not afford to underestimate Zimbabwe in Sunday 's World Series limited-overs cricket match at the WACA Ground .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;1	Zimbabwe has had mixed results since arriving in Australia , but held the top-grade Australian team to a two-wicket victory in the World Series tournament opener on Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;2	Zimbabwe scored 166-9 and Australia replied with 167-8 from 47.2 overs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;3	`` If Zimbabwe can maintain that sort of competitiveness and discipline throughout the series then they are going to be a force to contend with , '' said Australia A coach Chappell .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;4	`` Their top order looks strong .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;5	Their middle order looks to be their Achilles heel based on yesterday 's performance , but you ca n't really make a judgement on just one game . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;6	After viewing the bouncy pitch Saturday morning , Chappell was surprised it yielded such low scores and said he expects bigger totals on Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;7	`` Whoever bats first would be looking at about 220 or 230 , '' Chappell said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;8	`` When you look at the start Zimbabwe got yesterday , they probably should have ended up with 220 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;9	`` But what happens in these one-day games is the team batting second cut their cloth accordingly .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;10	`` If Zimbabwe had made 220 , then I think Australia would have made 220 or very close to it . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;11	Chappell said the Zimbabwe pace attack looks sound and he was impressed by 24-year-old leg-spinner Paul Strang .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;12	`` I heard he had been bowling well and he certainly lived up to that promise .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;13	His line looks very good , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;14	Chappell suggested Australia A will go into the match with off-spinner Gavin Robertson in its lineup .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;15	`` I would doubt we would go in without the spinner , '' Chappell said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;16	`` The slow bowlers have performed well on this wicket and for the sake of variety , you would tend to think he would play . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;17	With Merv Hughes certain to spearhead the bowling attack , pacemen Jo Angel , Paul Reiffel and Greg Rowell will fight for the remaining two positions .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;18	Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower is confident his side can reach 250 against any team in the competition .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;19	The lineup 's top three batsmen , Alistair Campbell , David Houghton and Flower , all got starts against Australia , but failed to capitalize with scores of 22 , 13 and 29 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;20	Flower said injury troubles had plagued his side .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;21	`` Campbell originally cracked his thumb in the series against Sri Lanka and it is worrying him again after he was hit by -LRB- a ball from -RRB- Jo Angel on Wednesday , '' Flower said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;22	`` Grant Flower also has a badly bruised hand .
APW_ENG_19941203.0016;23	It could even be fractured , but there is little either of them can do about it except bat on . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;0	In another display of U.N. divisions over how to handle the war in Bosnia , Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution aimed at cutting Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a recent rebel Serb offensive .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;1	The resolution brought to a vote Friday night was sponsored by Islamic and non-aligned states .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;2	It would have required U.N. border monitors to severely limit shipments of fuel and other supplies crossing the border between Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and Croatia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;3	U.N. resolutions already ban shipments of all but humanitarian supplies between Yugoslavia and Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;4	Some 100 to 150 tankers filled with fuel are being allowed to cross the Yugoslav border and reach rebel Serb forces in Croatia , said a diplomat who requested anonymity .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;5	Croatian and Bosnian diplomats say the fuel is well beyond humanitarian needs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;6	Croatian Serbs in recent weeks have crossed the border into northwest Bosnia and joined Bosnian Serbs in fighting the Bosnian government army around Bihac .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;7	Russia said it vetoed the resolution because it would tighten sanctions against Serbia , the main remaining state in Yugoslavia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;8	`` We hope that ultimately there will be a sound and balanced approach '' toward making peace in Bosnia , said Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;9	He has repeatedly accused the United Nations of using a double standard -- imposing sanctions against Serbia but ignoring acts by Bosnia 's Muslim-led army against Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;10	He said the resolution was `` untimely , '' since Yugoslavia had closed its border with Bosnia and was cooperating with peace negotiations .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;11	Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced in August that the border was being sealed to all but humanitarian aid to pressure Bosnian Serbs into accepting a peace plan , and the United Nations eased sanctions against Yugoslavia in October .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;12	The resolution Friday also called for the release of U.N. peacekeepers being held by Serb forces .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;13	Hours before the Security Council veto Friday -- the first in a year and a half -- diplomats from Russia , the United States , France , Britain and Germany endorsed a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia in hopes of drawing Serbs into peace negotiations to end the 2 -LCB- - year war .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;14	Western diplomats differed over the impact of the Russian veto on the prospects for peace in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;15	One said that the veto was an important sign to Russians , the Serbs ' traditional allies , but would probably get little reaction from Security Council members .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;16	But Ambassador Paul Keating of New Zealand disagreed .
APW_ENG_19941203.0017;17	`` We have no doubt that the consequences of today 's vote will be felt for a long time to come , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;0	Five days after the Australian government announced it had approved more military aid for Cambodia , the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group vowed Saturday to retaliate against Australians .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;1	In a broadcast over its private radio station using typically fiery rhetoric , the group said it would `` behead '' Australians .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;2	Australia announced Tuesday it would give 5 million Australian dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 3.75 million -RRB- in aid to Cambodia to help retrain the country 's armed forces but had ruled out the use of Australian soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;3	The package had no `` lethal material , '' Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and Defense Minister Robert Ray said in a joint statement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;4	Australia already provides dlrs 3 million a year in military assistance for mine clearing , military communications , establishment of a maritime workshop and English-language training for Cambodian military personnel .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;5	Australian ambassador Tony Kevin on Saturday warned his countrymen to be more careful but said they should not be intimidated .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;6	`` We encourage Australians , especially business people and aid agencies to continue to help Cambodia , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;7	`` We are not to going to let the security problem interfere . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;8	The Khmer Rouge , responsible for the deaths of more than one million Cambodians during a reign of terror from 1975 to 1978 , boycotted last year 's U.N.-sponsored elections and have been waging a guerrilla war against the Cambodian government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0018;9	King Norodom Sihanouk , who has long attempted to negotiate an end to the bloodshed , said this week he would not meet with the guerrilla group when he returns to Cambodia in January from Beijing , where he is being treated for medical problems .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;0	England will be without pace bowler Devon Malcolm and wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes when it faces the Australian Capital Territory in a one-day cricket game Sunday at Manuka Oval .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;1	The match is England 's final limited-overs warm-up before it faces Australia in its opening World Series game in Sydney on Tuesday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;2	Malcolm had hoped to play but still is recovering from chicken pox that has sidelined him for two weeks , while Alec Stewart will play behind the stumps -- a possible sign of England 's World Series plans .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;3	England captain Mike Atherton said Saturday that a victory is important for team morale after the First Test defeat against Australia in Brisbane last week .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;4	`` If you come out and lose , everyone is on your back and if you come out and win , everyone says ` So what ? '
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;5	, '' said Atherton .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;6	`` But after Brisbane , these games take on a bit of added importance . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;7	The tourists have played just three limited-overs games since arriving in Australia five weeks ago , defeating a Chairman 's XI in Perth in October and the Allan Border-captained Bradman XI in Bowral on Friday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0020;8	They lost to the Prime Minister 's XI at Manuka Oval on Nov. 9 .

APW_ENG_19941203.0022;0	Riddick Bowe threw one heavyweight title belt in a garbage can and lost two others in the ring .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;1	He begins his chase for yet another on Satuday night , not picky anymore about which title he holds .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;2	Bowe returns to the ring for only the second time since losing his World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation titles to Evander Holyfield 13 months ago .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;3	On Saturday night , he meets undefeated Larry Donald in a scheduled 12-round fight .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;4	This time , though , Bowe finds himself effectively shut off from the major titles and needing a win just to get a shot at the heavyweight crown from the lowly World Boxing Organization .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;5	`` I do n't care what title I have as long as it indicates I 'm heavyweight champion of the world , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;6	It 's a far cry from when Bowe held all three major titles , only to throw the World Boxing Council crown into a garbage can in a show of disdain for the organization .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;7	But with the heavyweight crown now split between George Foreman and Oliver McCall , neither of whom show any inclination to fight the former champion , Bowe can only look toward a fight with WBO champion Herbie Hide in the spring .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;8	`` I look at myself as being the uncrowned champion , '' Bowe said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;9	First , though , he must beat Donald , a stylish boxer who has won all 16 of his professional fights and who matches up well physically with Bowe .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;10	`` I 'm loaded with confidence , '' said Donald , a 4-1 underdog .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;11	`` I 'm a master boxer and I 'm on my way up . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;12	Bowe , whose only fight since losing to Holyfield was an aborted no contest against Buster Mathis Jr. in August , is taking a calculated risk in meeting an up-and-coming fighter whose style could give him problems .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;13	Bowe 's trainer , Eddie Futch , said the former champion has regained the fire that first won him the title .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;14	It showed at Thursday 's weigh-in , where a slimmed-down Bowe weighed 241 pounds -LRB- 109.2 kilograms -RRB- , his lightest since winning the titles from Holyfield two years ago .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;15	Donald weighed in at 228 pounds -LRB- 103.3 kilograms -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;16	Bowe will earn dlrs 1 million for the bout , beginning about 6:45 p.m. local time -LRB- 0245 GMT Sunday -RRB- from Caesars Palace .
APW_ENG_19941203.0022;17	Donald will earn dlrs 490,000 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;0	The truth behind the standoff between the PGA Tour and the new World Golf Tour will only be known when it comes time to put up the money and stop the talk .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;1	The World Golf Tour issued a statement Friday saying it was `` continuing to move ahead as planned '' with its venture to stage six to eight tournaments in 1995 , some of which would conflict with PGA Tour events .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;2	Greg Norman 's commitment to the World Golf Tour `` is as firm as ever , '' the statement said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;3	And Norman 's agent , Frank Williams , told The New York Times that `` Greg is still going full speed ahead . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;4	This all came one day after PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem released a statement in which he said Norman told him he had had a `` re-evaluation of this situation '' and had told Finchem `` he would not support any venture that would damage the PGA Tour . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;5	Norman , who joined World Golf Tour executive director John Montgomery Jr. and upstart U.S. TV network Fox Television in announcing the new tour two weeks ago , has wavered in his support of the venture since Finchem announced that he would suspend any PGA Tour member who played in events that conflict with the tour .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;6	No American professionals have committed to the world tour , no dates , sites or sponsors have been announced for the tournaments .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;7	`` They are very keen to keep communications open , '' Norman , who is in Australia , said about the PGA Tour .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;8	`` He -LRB- Finchem -RRB- asked me to see him when I get home , and I will do that .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;9	Right now , the World Tour and the PGA Tour have a chance of working this thing out . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;10	Norman is scheduled to meet with Finchem and Montgomery separately when he returns to the United States next week .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;11	As proposed , the new tour would have a 40-man field , based on the world rankings .
APW_ENG_19941203.0024;12	The prize money would provide dlrs 1 million for player of the year ; dlrs 600,000 to each tournament winner , and dlrs 30,000 to the last-place finisher , as well as dlrs 50,000 to each golfer for expenses .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;0	Michael Johnson ran only three races at 400 meters this year , but he made a huge impression .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;1	Johnson , 27 , was honored with the Jesse Owens Award Friday night as track and field 's top performer .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;2	His victories , the three best times in the world for the year , extended his winning streak in the 400 to 26 in a row .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;3	`` If you run 10 or 15 races a year , you can slack off on a few , '' Johnson said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;4	`` If you only run three races , you 've got to make sure they 're all fast . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;5	Johnson , of Rockwall , Texas , has n't lost in the 400 since 1989 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;6	This year he ran times of 44.32 and 44.04 seconds in August , and had a world-best 43.90 in Madrid , Spain , in September .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;7	He also had the fastest time run by an American in 1994 at 200 meters , a 19.94 clocking at a meet in Monaco .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;8	Johnson said he 'd run both events next year at the World Championships in Goteborg , Sweden , and also would double in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;9	Johnson edged two-time winner Jackie Joyner-Kersee , who set American records both indoors and outdoors in the long jump , in the closest balloting in history by media and the U.S. athletics community .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;10	The award was handed out at the annual USA Track & Field convention .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;11	Earlier in the day , Joyner-Kersee was honored as the world 's female athlete of the year by the International Athletic Foundation in Monaco .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;12	Last month , Johnson and Joyner-Kersee were named men 's and women 's track and field athletes of the year by the U.S. Olympic Committee .
APW_ENG_19941203.0026;13	Joyner-Kersee , who is competing in Australia , won the Owens Award in 1986 and ' 87 .

APW_ENG_19941203.0031;1	Resuming at an overnight score of 15 for one , the visitors lost night watchman Anderson Cummins for 17 , but opener Phil Simmons and Brian Lara determinedly hung on to the crease .
APW_ENG_19941203.0031;2	Simmons and Cummins put on 46 runs before Cummins was caught by Sanjay Manjrekar off Venkatapathy Raju .
APW_ENG_19941203.0031;3	Simmons was batting on 45 and Lara on 13 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0031;4	A double-century stand between Sachin Tendulkar and skipper Mohammad Azharuddhin had helped India reach 546 for nine just before stumps Friday .

APW_ENG_19941203.0032;0	Mark Calcavecchia shot a 2-under-par 70 Saturday and held onto his lead after the third round of the U.S. dlrs 637,500 Greg Norman Holden Classic at Royal Melbourne .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;1	Calcavecchia had a 10-under-par total of 206 over the par-72 , 6,993-yard Royal Melbourne course for a one-stroke advantage over three Australians : Anthony Gilligan , Glenn Joyner and tournament host Norman .

APW_ENG_19941203.0032;3	Peter McWhinney , who shared the lead with Calcavecchia after the second round , stumbled from the leader board with a 76 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;4	Calcavecchia led by two shots at the par-5 17th hole , but found the rough , had to take a drop and missed a long putt to save par .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;5	He had earlier bogeyed the par-5 second hole .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;6	`` I enjoyed it today , except the two par-5 holes I bogeyed , '' said the American .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;7	`` I was having fun .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;8	Hopefully I 'll feel good tomorrow and keep it going .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;9	`` There are a whole number of players that can win this tournament , but it is always better to be leading .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;10	There are some birdie holes out there , so it is up to me to go out and make some birdies . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;11	Norman , who has not won a tournament in his homeland for four years , was happier with his putting Saturday but had an up-and-down round that featured six birdies and three bogeys .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;12	`` I think the road has straightened out , or maybe I 've just turned the corner a bit , '' said Norman .
APW_ENG_19941203.0032;13	American Brad Faxon -LRB- 70 -RRB- and Australians Robert Allenby -LRB- 69 -RRB- and Terry Price -LRB- 67 -RRB- were grouped on 208 , just two strokes behind Calcavecchia .

APW_ENG_19941203.0032;15	The tournament concludes Sunday and offers a first prize of dlrs 115,000 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0035;0	Investigators probing a spy ring that stole secrets from India 's space program have arrested a businessman , the sixth person to be detained in the case , newspapers reported Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0035;1	Sudhir Kumar Sharma was arrested Thursday , The Times of India said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0035;2	He was based in the southern city of Bangalore , where the Indian Space Research Organization is located .
APW_ENG_19941203.0035;3	A day earlier , police arrested Nambi Narayanan , a rocket scientist who helped develop engines for launching satellites and missiles .

APW_ENG_19941203.0035;6	Newspapers , quoting unidentified police sources , reported that India 's arch-rival , Pakistan , was behind the ring .

APW_ENG_19941203.0035;8	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and are believed capable of producing nuclear weapons .

APW_ENG_19941203.0041;13	The government has paid out only dlrs 20 million so far and the balance has grown to dlrs 516 million .

APW_ENG_19941203.0043;2	Russia 's veto blocked a resolution aimed at stopping Yugoslav fuel supplies reportedly powering a Serb offensive in northern Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;3	Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the resolution would have tightened sanctions against Serbia , the main remaining state in Yugoslavia , which has been cooperating with international peace efforts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;4	`` We had no other choice than to vote against this draft , '' Lavrov said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;5	The move seemed to surprise many diplomats , but it cost Russia little .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;6	The United States did not press for the resolution and in brief remarks after the vote , deputy U.S. Ambassador Edward Gnehm made no direct mention of the veto .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;7	Lavrov has repeatedly accused the United Nations of a double standard , saying the council has imposed sanctions against Serbia but has ignored Muslim acts against Serbs -- Russia 's traditional allies .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;8	The veto came amid increasing signs of Russian assertiveness on the council .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;9	On Tuesday , Russia abstained on a resolution that increased the U.N. team in Haiti tenfold to 500 members .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;10	At the time , Lavrov accused Security Council members of focusing a `` disproportionate '' amount of attention on Haiti and of dragging its feet on `` situations that actually threaten international peace . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;11	Russia has repeatedly called on the council to take a more active role in Georgia and Tajikistan , where Russia has deployed peacekeepers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;12	On Friday , the council acted , calling on Georgia and its breakaway province of Abkhazia to press forward with peace talks .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;13	Russia last used its veto in May 1993 to block a proposal on financing the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;14	Vetos have been used 281 times in the Security Council since the United Nations was founded in 1945 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;15	Lavrov said Friday 's veto did not mean the death of the five-nation contact group pushing for peace in Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0043;16	He stressed that hours before the veto , diplomats from Russia , the United States , France , Britain and Germany demonstrated their unity by endorsing a confederation of Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia .

APW_ENG_19941203.0045;0	President Kim Young-sam on Saturday ordered one of South Korea 's biggest government reshuffles , saying it will streamline key economic functions to help the country compete in the world market .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;1	The shakeup will eliminate two Cabinet ministers , three vice ministers and dozens of other high-ranking posts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;2	The move , to take effect early next year , subject to parliamentary approval , is seen as part of Kim 's efforts to salvage his 20-month-old administration from gridlock .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;3	The country has been wracked in recent months by a series of disasters , corruption scandals , violent farmers ' protests and political bickering .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;4	In South Korea , it is common for the president to make a Cabinet reshuffle or announce important decisions to shake up a political stalemate when the government suffers serious scandals .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;5	`` The reorganization aims at a smaller but more efficient government in an age of a global economy , '' presidential spokesman Choo Don-shik quoted Kim as telling a meeting of key government officials .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;6	The highlight of the shakeup , one of the most extensive since the republic was founded in 1948 , is the merger of the Finance Ministry with the Economic Planning Board , a government ministry in charge of drawing up the budget and coordinating economic policies .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;7	The sprawling Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy will be streamlined to focus more on trade and industry .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;8	The Transportation Ministry and the Construction Ministry are to be merged , and the Communications Ministry will take on certain functions from other ministries to deal with the information revolution , Choo said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;9	Kim has warned that divisive internal disputes leave South Korea badly prepared as it tries to cope with a new world trade agreement in an increasingly competitive world market .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;10	Recently , farmers staged violent street protests over the government 's decision to open its markets to foreign farm produce .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;11	A major bridge in Seoul collapsed in October , killing 32 people and triggering public anger over the government 's failure to manage state facilities .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;12	Tax collectors were found to have pocketed millions of dollars in what is snowballing into a nationwide tax scandal .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;13	Also Saturday , the opposition Democratic Party staged a massive outdoor demonstration in Puchon , just outside Seoul , to press its demand that the government indict former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo for engineering a 1979 military coup that put Chun in power .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;14	The opposition says it wo n't cooperate in approving the GATT deal and other important bills unless the government agrees to bring them to trial .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;15	Chun and Roh , while still generals , established a junta to rule the country after the death of their mentor , President Park Chung-hee .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;16	Roh succeeded Chun as president in 1988 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;17	Fearing their prosecution would trigger serious political unrest , Kim has urged the nation to let history judge the December 1979 coup .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;18	Critics say Kim , a former opposition leader , owes his political success to Roh because he became president after merging his party with Roh 's governing party in 1990 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0045;19	The political scene was further strained Friday when the governing Democratic Liberal Party snubbed the opposition and unilaterally approved the 1995 budget .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;0	Rescuers located two more survivors Saturday and recovered an additional body from a ferry with more than 600 people on board that sank after colliding with a cargo ship .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;1	The recovery of the body of an elderly woman brought the confirmed death toll in Friday 's collision to 35 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;2	More than 110 people remained missing .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;3	Rescue efforts resumed at daybreak Saturday , as the coast guard held the freighter , the Singapore-registered Kota Suria , and its 30-man crew in custody .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;4	Coast guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Amado Samante said the two survivors had been taken by fishermen to the coastal town of Naic in Cavite province , a few kilometers -LRB- miles -RRB- from where the ferry Cebu City sank .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;5	The two brought the total number of people confirmed to have survived to 453 out of the 608 on board the ferry , the boat 's owners said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;6	Some discrepancies remained between the coast guard 's and the owners ' figures .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;7	The cause of the accident was not yet known , but an official of William Lines , the owners , claimed the ferry had been rammed by the freighter , which had its bow badly dented .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;8	The freighter is to be held during the investigation , which will last several weeks , Samante said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;9	Jacob Cabatuan , a crewman on the ferry , said the freighter crashed bow-first into the ship , destroying the bridge and ripping a one-meter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- hole in the lower deck .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;10	He said the ferry 's captain , first and second mates were pinned on the bridge .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;11	Passengers , many of whom were asleep after the ferry 's predawn departure from Manila , said they had no warning of the accident .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;12	The ferry sank into mud under about 25 meters -LRB- 85 feet -RRB- of water .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;13	Four teams of coast guard and navy divers were searching the ship for bodies believed trapped in the cabins , Samante said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;14	About 50 coast guard , navy and commercial sea vessels were involved in the search effort Saturday , he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;15	`` We are hopeful to find survivors , '' said Samante .

APW_ENG_19941203.0046;17	The 2,452-ton Cebu City had left Manila bound for the resort area of Tagbilaran , the capital of Bohol Island , about 560 kilometers -LRB- 350 miles -RRB- to the southeast , a 28-hour boat trip .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;18	The ferry , usually used by families and small business owners , sank 30 minutes after it and the 12,500-ton freighter collided .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;19	William Lines said the Cebu City had a capacity of 800 passengers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;20	It sank near the town of Rosario , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- southwest of Manila in Cavite province .
APW_ENG_19941203.0046;21	The Philippines ' worst peacetime ferry disaster was in December 1987 , when 4,341 people died in the collision of the ferry Dona Paz with the oil tanker Vector off Mindoro Island , about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- south of Manila .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;0	KARACHI , Pakistan -LRB- AP -RRB- - About 15,000 people , including several top Pakistani celebrities , marched through the streets of this troubled port city Saturday chanting `` Save Karachi '' and demanding an end to worsening violence .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;1	`` Karachi is bleeding and I have come to press for peace , '' said social worker Nargis Latif , who like most of the marchers dressed in white to signify peace .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;2	Political and ethnic violence has claimed hundreds of lives in Karachi this year .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;3	Government services have all but collapsed and many residents complain of a general sense of lawlessness .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;4	In the latest outburst of violence , seven people were gunned down Friday night .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;5	Three victims were fatally shot when attackers opened fire outside the house of the country 's labor minister , Akbar Lasi .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;6	The minister was in the capital of Islamabad at the time of the attack .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;7	The march , organized by the country 's leading newspaper publisher , began in the center of the city at the mausoleum of Mohammed Ali Jinnah , Pakistan 's founding father .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;8	In a festive atmosphere that included music and signing , the marchers traveled almost 10 kilometers -LRB- 6.2 miles -RRB- to the main government offices .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;9	One of the march leaders was Imran Khan , Pakistan 's most famous cricket player .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;10	Marchers threw rose petals on Khan and a number of film and television stars who took part in the procession .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;11	The army , which patrolled the streets of Karachi for the past 30 months , was withdrawn Wednesday and many fear the police force and a paramilitary unit will be unable to maintain control .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;12	The unrest has disrupted business in the country 's financial capital and frightened away potential foreign investors .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;13	Much of the violence pits the security forces against the Mohajir Quami Movement , a powerful opposition group that represents mohajirs , or Muslim immigrants from India .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;14	The MQM accuses Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of discriminating against mohajirs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0047;15	Ms. Bhutto 's government , meanwhile , says the MQM is a terrorist organization that uses violence to advance its cause .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;0	A solar telescope to be used in an international project to monitor vibrations inside the sun is en route to the Canary Islands .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;1	In the coming months , sun-watching telescopes will also be sent to Australia , India , Chile , Hawaii and California .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;2	`` This is a great milestone , '' said project manager Jim Kennedy of the Tucson-based National Solar Observatory .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;3	`` These instruments are going to have a very major impact on our understanding not only of how our own sun works , but how other stars work as well .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;4	`` At the present time , what we know about the inside of the sun basically comes from looking at the outside of the sun and making guesses about what must be happening beneath the surface , '' he added .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;5	About 20 years ago , scientists discovered that the sun resonates like a bell , the vibrations caused by sound waves bouncing around inside .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;6	Scientists probe the sun 's interior by studying its sound waves much as geologists analyze seismic waves to learn about the Earth 's interior .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;7	The six telescopes will track the sun throughout the day .
APW_ENG_19941203.0048;8	When the sun sets at one station , the next station to the west will pick it up and continue observations , providing around-the-clock coverage .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;0	Mitsuyo Hirata on Saturday fired the day 's best score -- a 5-under-par 67 -- and vaulted into a one-shot lead going into the final round of the Mizuno Ladies Golf Tournament , the season 's final event on the Japan LPGA tour .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;1	Hirata , who won one tournament in 1993 , started the second round three shots behind leader Australian Nicole Lowien , and carded one eagle , four birdies and one bogey for a 8-under-par 136 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;2	Nayoko Yoshikawa was in second place at 137 after shooting a 70 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;3	Another shot back at 138 was Aiko Hashimoto , who fired a 68 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;4	Lowien sank to a 141 after turning in a 75 and was tied with Miyuki Shimabukuro in fifth place .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;5	Mayumi Hirase , who leads the Japan LPGA money list , fired a 73 for a 146 total .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;6	Fifty-one players made the cut at 149 and advanced to Sunday 's final round of the tournament , which offers a top prize of 10.8 million yen -LRB- dlrs 108,000 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;7	Ikuyo Shiotani , currently second on the Japan LPGA money list , shot a fat 80 for a 150 and failed to make the cut , along with Ayako Okamoto , who shot a 76 for a 153 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0049;8	The 60 million yen -LRB- dlrs 600,000 -RRB- tournament is being held on the 6,274-yard , par-72 Kumamoto Chuo Country Club course in southern Japan .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;0	A kiss is just a kiss .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;1	But in Japan , it 's a social statement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;2	Kissing in public , considered shocking a few years ago , has come into vogue .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;3	Japanese couples are bussing on buses and puckering up on park benches .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;4	The trend has set off a debate about changing mores in a country still strongly influenced by conservative Confucian standards .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;5	`` I feel very uncomfortable seeing them doing that , '' said Etsuko Yamashita , 38 , who lectures on feminism at Japan Women 's University .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;6	`` If my children did that , I would scold them . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;7	The kissing contingent , though , is unrepentant .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;8	`` That kind of public kissing should be accepted , '' said 18-year-old Yuko Asayama .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;9	Her boyfriend , Shiro Akiba , said he feels relaxed about kissing her in front of mutual friends but is still shy in public .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;10	Part of the reason public kissing is considered so provocative is that in Japan , a kiss has traditionally been viewed as a prelude to sex .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;11	Japanese people do not kiss and hug in greeting , but bow instead .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;12	Kissing was prohibited in movies until after World War II .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;13	But in a bizarre bit of social engineering , U.S. occupation forces instructed Japanese filmmakers to begin showing on-screen kisses .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;14	Japanese actors and actresses went along , but unwillingly , using tissue paper to avoid direct lip contact .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;15	Even with the film barrier broken , public displays of affection in Japan remained rare compared to the United States and Europe .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;16	Analysts say the public-kissing trend was pioneered by television commercials .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;17	A 1992 spot by the cosmetics firm Kose Corp. had a young woman exclaiming `` Chu shite ! ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;18	-- roughly translated as `` Kiss me , darling ! ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;19	Cosmetics rival Shiseido , not to be outdone , has been racking up big sales of no-smudge lipstick , which it markets with a boast that it will last through a long smooching session and leave the kissee unsmeared .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;20	Like most trends here , the bussing boom is being explored enthusiastically by Japanese media .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;21	One popular biweekly magazine had a recent article instructing young male readers in what it called `` the art of public kissing . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;22	The magazine , Popeye , recommended coffee shops and empty train cars as good places for beginners to practice .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;23	But it cautioned : `` Do n't get too excited . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;24	Michio Koseki , a senior editor at Popeye , said the kissing trend is a sign that young people are abandoning the reticence of their elders .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;25	`` It 's their statement that it is nothing to feel embarrassed to show the world that they 're in love and enjoying being in love , '' Koseki said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;26	Others believe it 's just a fad based on Western movies .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;27	`` Those couples look extremely unnatural , '' said lawyer Mizuho Fukushima .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;28	Japan 's sexual mores have always featured a mix of prudishness and brazen behavior .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;29	Many young `` office ladies '' who are expected to wear demure uniforms and pour tea by day don stripper-style garb for club nights out on the town .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;30	Scantily dressed women appear on television variety shows even during the day , and pictures of nude women are routinely printed in news magazines .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;31	Fukushima said that even if kissing in public is only a fad , at least it does n't exploit women .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;32	`` The current trend is not forcing women into being victims of sexism , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0051;33	`` Both parties seem to be equally enthusiastic . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;0	In cars , on foot and even in wheelchairs , Taiwanese thronged to the polls Saturday in the toughest electoral test for the island 's Nationalist rulers in 45 years .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;1	The local elections marked a milestone in Taiwan 's 7-year-old transformation from virtual dictatorship to multi-party democracy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;2	Voters chose a governor for the first time , and mayors for Taipei and Kaohsiung for the first time since 1967 and 1979 respectively , as well as local councils and the provincial assembly .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;3	State-run TV said polling stations closed on schedule at 4 p.m. -LRB- 0800 GMT -RRB- and results were expected about eight hours later .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;4	Newspapers and TV estimated that 70 percent to 80 percent of Taiwan 's 13.8 million eligible voters turned out .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;5	President Lee Teng-hui , who is credited with steering Taiwan through its transition to democracy , cast his vote in a Taipei stadium shortly after polling stations opened at 8 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;6	Older voters in wheelchairs and couples with children lined up in the rain to vote in schools , sports grounds and Buddhist temples , sometimes waiting half an hour for their turn .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;7	Campaigning for the election was feverish and , at times , violent .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;8	No incidents were reported during the voting , but there were fears that violence might erupt when results were announced .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;9	Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou appealed to people to watch the results on TV and not mass outside party headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;10	Police said 70,000 officers were deployed , and Lee appealed to Taiwanese to `` welcome a new era of democracy for all . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;11	The polls are a prelude to Taiwan 's first direct presidential election in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;12	Lee 's prospects for another term will be measured by his Nationalists ' performance against the main opposition , the Democratic Progressive Party .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;13	The Nationalists fled to Taiwan to escape the 1949 Communist takeover of mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;14	They still say they hope one day to reunite Taiwan with the Chinese motherland .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;15	But the DPP advocates Taiwanese independence , something China has vowed to resist by force , claiming Taiwan is a renegade province .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;16	Campaigning focused largely on `` Tong-Du '' -- reunification vs. independence -- and DPP successes could provoke misgivings in Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;17	Business leaders placed newspaper ads warning that Taiwan 's dollar and the island 's standing with investors could plummet if pro-independence forces gained power .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;18	But the DPP may profit from a split in the Nationalist vote caused by the recently formed New Party , which quit the Nationalists last year , accusing them of abandoning the commitment to reunification .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;19	Opinion polls were suspended several days before the election , making it difficult to forecast the result .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;20	But in the most recent polls , the DPP 's Chen Shui-bian was thought to be a front-runner for mayor of Taipei , while Nationalist James Soong had a 50-40 lead over the DPP 's Chen Ting-nan in the race for governor .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;21	Candidates held final rallies Friday night , including tens of thousands of cheering New Party supporters who packed Taipei 's municipal stadium .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;22	The carnival-like election campaign underlined Taiwan 's enthusiasm for democracy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;23	Taipei 's streets and many of its taxis were covered with flags .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;24	In the last few days , campaigners lulled the capital to sleep at night with drums and roused it each morning with firecrackers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;25	Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung even complained that precious resources were wasted and that the campaign flags `` could have clothed 1 million refugees . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;26	Voters also were urged not to take bribes , a problem in past elections as well as this one .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;27	The DPP filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the Nationalists of earmarking about 150 million Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 5.6 million -RRB- to buy votes for Huang Ta-chou , Taipei 's incumbent Nationalist mayor , who is lagging in opinion polls .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;28	The Nationalists denied the allegations and denounced vote-buying .
APW_ENG_19941203.0052;29	Government-controlled TV ran advertisements showing vote-buyers in handcuffs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;0	Ten months after his death at age 31 , the eldest son of President Hafez Assad is a towering presence across Syria .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;1	Giant portraits of Basil Assad , a lover of fast cars who died in a car wreck , drape the fronts of buildings .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;2	His photographs are displayed in car windows and on the walls of offices , shops and homes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;3	They send a message -- not only of what might have been , but of what still can be : A new generation of the Assad family governing Syria .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;4	There are three more Assad sons .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;5	The second son , Bashar , is 29 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;6	Photographs of him are rarely seen .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;7	But in Syria , people are used to reading between the lines of propaganda .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;8	And hard-to-miss hints have been emerging .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;9	In the officially sanctioned `` Paean to the Thoughts of the Hero Basil Assad , '' the author , army Col. Bahjat Suleyman , begins :
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;10	`` Hope vanished ... on a bitter winter day after he brought to us a promise of a beautiful spring that 's full of colors and birds chirping . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;11	But , the book concludes , nothing can stop `` Basil Assad 's generation from clinging to the second brother , Bashar Assad , and accompanying him ... toward the third millennium A.D. ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;12	The question of succession is increasingly important as Syria undergoes social and economic changes and talks peace with its nemesis , Israel .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;13	President Assad , who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1970 , is 64 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;14	Ever since he suffered a heart attack a decade ago , some foreign governments have periodically speculated he is in poor health .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;15	But Assad remains very much in control and as shrewd as ever .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;16	Syrian officials insist his health is fine .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;17	Western diplomats in Damascus point out that many people whose health is less than robust live to old age .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;18	Diplomats and foreign-based political analysts question whether Bashar has the right stuff to guide a nation where stability traditionally has depended on a leader of undisputed strength .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;19	Bashar was training in England as an opthalmologist when his brother , an army major , died .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;20	He cut short his studies and came home to enter the military academy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;21	He graduated in November as a captain in command of a tank regiment .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;22	Bashar now heads most of the committees his brother presided over , mainly ones relating to sports .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;23	Any presidential successor is likely to need the approval of Assad 's close cadre of military and intelligence advisers , many of them from Assad 's own minority Alawite sect of Islam .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;24	In March , longtime Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass signaled support for Bashar in a speech before the president .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;25	`` I see in the eyes of your son , Dr. Bashar Assad , the will , determination and ability to raise the banner that Basil raised , '' said Tlass , a member of the Sunni Muslim majority .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;26	The presidential succession is a highly sensitive subject and rarely discussed in public .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;27	Despite his severe rule , Assad is valued by many people for presiding over modern Syria 's longest-lasting government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;28	There were 20 coups in the first 24 years after Syria became independent from France in 1946 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;29	In the second 24 years , there has been only Hafez Assad .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;30	Would-be challengers have been deterred by the example set by Assad 's suppression of a 1982 uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;31	The army killed up to 10,000 people and leveled much of the city , ending a bloody five-year campaign of bombings and subversion .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;32	But Basil 's death last Jan. 21 was a serious blow for Assad .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;33	For years , government propaganda had molded Basil into a national hero .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;34	He was dubbed `` the Golden Knight '' and lauded for his accomplishments as an amateur horseman .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;35	Pictures of Basil started appearing when he was alive , usually in the windows of cars and jeeps driven by young men from politically elite circles .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;36	Since his death , they have multiplied monthly across Syria .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;37	At a recent crafts show , nearly all the paintings depicted Basil -- glowing on black velvet or in ethereal oils .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;38	Along the streets and in offices , murals and photographs -- often trimmed with tinsel and decorative lights -- depict a macho young man in paratrooper 's fatigues at his father 's side or in an ivory riding suit on a polo field .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;39	Syrians insist their adoration of Basil is spontaneous and not fostered by the government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;40	`` He did a lot of good things for the country , the kinds of things nobody could forget , '' said one merchant .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;41	But like many others , he was unable to give any examples .
APW_ENG_19941203.0053;42	He also declined to give his name .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;0	Thousands of gaunt men and women -- survivors of the world 's worst industrial disaster -- marched through Bhopal Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of the calamity that killed 7,000 people .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;1	The central Indian city observed a partial strike in memory of those killed when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide plant owned by an Indian subsidiary of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp.
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;2	Survivors and orphaned children gathered in front of the closed factory to beat and burn straw-and-bamboo effigies of Warren Anderson , who headed Union Carbide at the time .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;3	Elders , many with tears in their eyes , shouted `` death to Anderson . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;4	Local leaders made speeches demanding Anderson be tried in India for mass murder , while others spoke of the plight of the half-million people seeking compensation .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;5	`` I know all this may produce nothing , but I decided to come , '' said Kamal Pancham , who lost his daughter and father in the disaster .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;6	It was the second day of demonstrations to mark the disaster .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;7	About 3,000 people marched near the state legislature Friday , but police arrested 11,000 people as they headed to the city for the anniversary .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;8	Tens of thousands of people fled panic-stricken the night of Dec. 2 , 1984 , when a metal tank at the plant leaked the deadly gas .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;9	Some 4,000 people died that night ; 3,000 other deaths were later blamed on the effects of the gas .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;10	Five years ago , Union Carbide paid dlrs 470 million -- one-twelfth of India 's original claim -- in an out-of-court settlement that guaranteed immunity from prosecution for Carbide executives .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;11	India 's Supreme Court later struck down the immunity clause .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;12	Eight officials of Union Carbide 's Indian subsidiary were charged with manslaughter , but none has been brought to trial .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;13	Meanwhile , India 's slow-moving courts have been overwhelmed with claims , and bureaucratic corruption has further stymied those seeking compensation .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;14	So far , the government has paid out only dlrs 20 million while the fund has grown to dlrs 516 million .
APW_ENG_19941203.0054;15	`` Even after 10 years we look like beggars asking for alms , '' Rehena Begum , a voluntary worker , told a group of 500 women survivors .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;0	Step right up , it 's election time in Taiwan -- which means fun , feasting and cash to help undecided voters make up their minds .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;1	By all accounts , Saturday 's local elections were characteristically spicy and seamy , despite official efforts to stamp the bad habits out of Taiwan 's rapidly blossoming democracy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;2	Saturday 's elections for a governor , mayors , local councillors and provincial assemblymen were Taiwan 's most extensive since the ruling Nationalist Party fled to the island to escape the 1949 Communist takeover of mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;3	Campaigning was feverish , the crash of drums , cymbals and firecrackers so loud that one newspaper joked Saturday that Taiwanese were looking forward to hearing just the usual din of traffic .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;4	Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung complained that the blizzard of campaign banners `` could have clothed 1 million refugees . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;5	Besides a number of brawls , there was mudslinging of a highly personal nature .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;6	For example , Chen Shui-bian , the Democratic Progressive Party 's candidate for mayor of Taipei , was reported by newspapers to have publicly declared that he had a vasectomy , thus rebutting allegations that he fathered an illegitimate son with a campaign aide .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;7	On Wednesday the DPP filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the Nationalists of earmarking about 150 million Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 5.6 million -RRB- to buy votes for Huang Ta-chou , Taipei 's incumbent Nationalist mayor , who was lagging in opinion polls .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;8	The Nationalists denied the allegations and the government ran a vigorous publicity campaign against vote-buying , showing TV ads of offenders being led away handcuffed .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;9	The Justice Ministry said courts received some 400 complaints of vote abuse during the campaign .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;10	Nonetheless , newspapers reported the going rate for a vote was 500 to 1,000 Taiwan dollars -LRB- dlrs 20-40 -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;11	The practice is probably rooted in Taiwan 's early days , when it was regarded as natural to refund a farmer or laborer for income lost by taking a day off to vote .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;12	As democracy developed in the late 1980s and newspapers became free to expose abuses , the Nationalists were held up as the worst offenders , and they realized that ultimately their corrupt image would jeopardize their hold on power .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;13	So they have stiffened the penalties and launched a series of cleanup measures , forcing candidates to find more subtle means of persuasion , like banquets or sightseeing trips around the island .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;14	Banquets for 1,000 voters are not unusual .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;15	The sightseers are asked to pay a nominal fee so that the trip ca n't be formally termed a bribe .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;16	A controversial feature of Taiwanese campaigning is the lightly clad women who dance on the stage at rallies .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;17	At one rally , the attire was so scanty that James Soong , the Nationalist candidate for governor , refused to get on the stage .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;18	And then there are the campaign promises -- of new railroads , airports , old-age pensions , hospitals -- goodies which cost an estimated 2 trillion Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. dlrs 74 billion -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;19	`` It is part of Taiwanese culture to throw banquets and send presents when you need people 's help , or when you want to get close to them , '' said Huang Hwei-chen , director of the private Institute for National Policy Research .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;20	He saw it as an inevitable symptom of democratization .
APW_ENG_19941203.0055;21	`` Democracy seems sort of commercialized , but it is in a transition , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;0	A bomb explosion early Saturday at the headquarters of the pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Ulke killed one person and injured 19 others , the Anatolia news agency reported .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;1	The bomb caused heavy damage to the building , destroyed several cars in the street and shattered windows of nearby houses , Anatolia said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;2	Another overnight explosion at Ozgur Ulke 's Ankara office caused heavy damage , but no casualties , Anatolia added .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;3	No one claimed immediate responsibility for either attack .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;4	Scores of Ozgur Ulke -LRB- Free Country -RRB- employees have been jailed for supporting the Kurdish rebels , and 10 of its reporters have been killed in unsolved murders .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;5	Human rights groups accuse the security forces of involvement in the murders , but the government denies the accusations .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;6	Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0056;7	More than 13,000 people have been killed in the violence .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;0	Government forces killed four Tamil Tiger rebels this week in two separate clashes , which have continued despite the president 's offer of a cease-fire and peace talks .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;1	Troops killed three rebels Friday in Panichchankerni , 200 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Colombo , Brig. Gemunu Kulatunga , the military 's spokesman , said today .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;2	In Namalpokuna , guerrillas attacked policemen Thursday night and one rebel was killed in the cross fire , he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;3	No casualties were reported on the government side .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;4	Rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has agreed to President Chandrika Kumaratunga 's offer to restart peace talks to end the 11-year-old war , but no date has been set .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;5	Negotiations were suspended after a suspected rebel suicide bomber killed opposition presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake and 56 others on Oct. 24 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;6	More than 34,000 people have been killed in the fighting .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;7	The rebels want a homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority , who are mostly Hindu and comprise about 3 million of the country 's 17 million people .
APW_ENG_19941203.0057;8	They accuse the majority Buddhist Sinhalese of discrimination .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;0	Canadian peacekeepers at their camp near Sarajevo were anxiously awaiting the release of 55 Canadians today after a Bosnian Serb promise to stop holding hundreds of UN soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;1	But there was no sign this morning that the release was under way , said a spokesman in the Muslim village of Visoko , headquarters for the 800 Canadian troops serving with the UN Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;2	The more than 400 Canadians at the camp were watching every news bulletin on television and monitoring political developments in the capital of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;3	`` Everybody here is up and hoping they 'll be released today , '' said Maj. Geoff Hall , second in command at the camp .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;4	`` Personally , I assume nothing in Bosnia , but this time this promise just might be for real . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;5	The Canadians have been held for 10 days at various sites in Serb-held territory near Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;6	Hall said the detained Canadians , who are in radio contact with the camp , said this morning there was no indication they were about to be released .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;7	`` There is no change among our detained Canadians , so we 'll just have to wait this one out and see what happens . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;8	UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Friday Serb leaders agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since last Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;9	`` In addition , we have agreed that normal activities be restored to the Canadians -- 55 Canadians near Visoko -- and all other soldiers from other countries that were doing their work at weapons collection sites , '' Akashi said after talks with Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale , near Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;10	But Defense Minister David Collenette said in Ottawa on Friday Canadian officers in Bosnia could n't confirm the reports of agreement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;11	And Maj. Rita Lepage , a Canadian military spokeswoman in Zagreb , Croatia , said today there was no timetable for the release .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;12	But she did not dismiss the Serb agreement as just another broken Serb promise to the UN .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;13	`` This is certainly the most encouraging development so far , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;14	The Serbs did release 70 Dutch troops in good condition Friday but are holding about 300 more to discourage NATO air strikes against a Serb siege of the Muslim pocket of Bihac , a UN-declared safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;15	About 20 Canadians are at a police complex in the village of Ilijas .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;16	The rest are at checkpoints and observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;17	Maj. Dean Milner , senior officer among the detainees , is able to drive around in his vehicle and visit his soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;18	The Serbs also let supply vehicles from camp bring the soldiers mail , food and other items .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;19	Hall said the Canadians , if released , would be given at least 24 hours to rest before being allowed to give media interviews .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;20	The camp was making preparations Friday for their release , including stocking up on food for a special steak-and-eggs meal for detainees .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;21	The detainees , when released , will be debriefed , given time to rest and then allowed to `` get things off their chest '' at counselling sessions with people of their own rank , Hall said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;22	The camp stayed at the high alert level of orange today , which requires personnel to wear flak jackets and helmets when moving around outside .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;23	Hall said the camp will stay at orange until the `` whole detention problem is over . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;24	Meanwhile , in Paris on Friday , Peter Donolo , a spokesman for Prime Minister Jean Chretien , said : `` Obviously we 're encouraged by the developments .
APW_ENG_19941203.0058;25	We 're keeping our fingers crossed , but we 're not going to rest until our troops have full freedom of movement .

APW_ENG_19941203.0059;3	Much of the violence pits the security forces against the Mohajir Quami Movement , which claims the government discriminates against Muslim immigrants from India .
APW_ENG_19941203.0059;4	Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has accused the MQM of using violence to advance its cause .
APW_ENG_19941203.0059;5	The army , which patrolled the streets of Karachi for the past 30 months , was withdrawn Wednesday , leaving police and paramilitary forces to maintain control .

APW_ENG_19941203.0061;0	Police have arrested seven people suspected of leading a riot by pedicab drivers in the West Java city of Bandung , an official said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;1	Thousands of pedicab drivers burned cars and smashed dozens of store windows Thursday after hearing a rumor that a fellow driver had been killed in a collision with a car belonging to the city 's Public Order Office .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;2	Four of the 12 cars set on fire by the protesters reportedly belonged to the city .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;3	The rioters dispersed after police told them that the pedicab driver had not been seriously injured .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;4	`` Most shops have been reopened , but a few others are still closed , '' said Diding Kurniady , spokesman of Bandung municipality .

APW_ENG_19941203.0061;6	Pedicab drivers are irate over restrictions imposed by the city , and the seizure of pedicabs that violate city rules .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;7	The more than 2,000 pedicabs , called `` becak , '' operating in Bandung are not allowed to enter the center of the city to prevent traffic jams .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;8	They are only able to operate in narrow alleys , but drivers sometimes break the rules in an attempt to earn more money .
APW_ENG_19941203.0061;9	Col. Didi Widayadi , head of the Bandung police , said police had started questioning the seven people suspected of leading the protest .

APW_ENG_19941203.0062;12	About 100 soldiers and 100 police officers worked into the night looking for survivors and keeping away the curious .
APW_ENG_19941203.0062;13	Rescue workers said part of the destroyed building was sleeping quarters for railway personnel and their families , including small children who were likely victims .
APW_ENG_19941203.0062;14	Defense Minister Gyoergy Keleti said dogs normally used to locate victims of mining disasters had found three children who were dug from the rubble .
APW_ENG_19941203.0062;15	Local Police Chief Gyoergy Lengyel said the train was traveling at about 110 kilometers -LRB- 66 miles -RRB- per hour , normal speed past a station that was not a stop .

APW_ENG_19941203.0063;2	U.S. participation in the trade pact got final approval from Congress this week .

APW_ENG_19941203.0063;7	`` He would bring to the WTO a wealth of experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing country , '' the White House statement said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0063;8	`` As Mexico 's president for six years , President Salinas led his country through a successful process of economic reform and trade liberalization , '' it said .

APW_ENG_19941203.0064;0	Japan , the only country attacked by atomic bombs , has formally asked the United States to reconsider a plan to issue a stamp showing a nuclear mushroom cloud , a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;1	The Japanese Embassy in Washington conveyed the request on Friday , stressing that the Japanese people have strong feelings against the stamp , which is inscribed , `` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , Aug. 1943 . ''

APW_ENG_19941203.0064;3	The U.S. Postal Service plans to begin selling the stamp next September .
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;4	The stamp depicts a mushroom cloud said to be a combination of images from the explosions of U.S. atomic tests and atomic bombs dropped by U.S. forces on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the closing days of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;5	Takashi Hiraoka , the mayor of Hiroshima , said in a statement Friday that `` it is regrettable that the description under the mushroom cloud will lead to an understanding that the use of the atomic bomb was right . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;6	`` Whatever reasons there were , the use of nuclear weapons is not forgiven .
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;7	It is not an appropriate time to show the power of nuclear weapons while the world is tackling nuclear disarmament , '' Hiraoka said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;8	In Washington , Postal Service spokesman Robin Wright said Friday that the stamp commemorated an `` historically critical event . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0064;9	`` Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of events of World War II and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events , '' Wright added .

APW_ENG_19941203.0068;0	Japan , the only country attacked by atomic bombs , has formally asked the United States to reconsider a plan to issue a stamp showing a nuclear mushroom cloud , a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;1	The Japanese Embassy in Washington conveyed the request on Friday , stressing that the Japanese people have strong feelings against the stamp , which is inscribed , `` Atomic bombs hasten war 's end , Aug. 1945 . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;2	The official said the U.S. Department of State replied that it is studying the Japanese request .
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;3	The U.S. Postal Service plans to begin selling the stamp next September .
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;4	The stamp depicts a mushroom cloud said to be a combination of images from the explosions of U.S. atomic tests and atomic bombs dropped by U.S. forces on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the closing days of World War II .
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;5	Takashi Hiraoka , the mayor of Hiroshima , said in a statement Friday that `` it is regrettable that the description under the mushroom cloud will lead to an understanding that the use of the atomic bomb was right . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0068;6	`` Whatever reasons there were , the use of nuclear weapons is not forgiven .

APW_ENG_19941203.0071;0	A volcano which erupted two weeks ago , killing at least 52 people , has again begun releasing hot gas and lava , forcing authorities to call off a search for earlier victims .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;1	Lieut. Col. Supiadin , military commander of Sleman regency , said red-hot lava was spewing down from the crater and more than 70 emissions of hot gas and steam had been recorded in the past day .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;2	`` We are not taking chances and have asked everybody to stop their search until the situation gets better , '' he said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;3	The searchers are looking for about 200 people who are still missing from the earlier eruption .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;4	The search will resume when the volcanic activity subsides , Supiadin said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;5	More than 5,000 people were evacuated two weeks ago from villages which were devastated when a huge cloud of scorching steam and gas suddenly swept down the side of Mount Merapi .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;6	The mountain is about 580 kilometers -LRB- 360 miles -RRB- east of Indonesia 's capital of Jakarta and 30 kilometers -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- north of the tourist city of Jogjakarta .

APW_ENG_19941203.0071;8	Tons of ash were dumped on the disaster site and some lava poured out .
APW_ENG_19941203.0071;9	Scores of people were badly burned by the fast-moving cloud , which had an estimated temperature of 200 degrees Celsius -LRB- 392 F -RRB- .

APW_ENG_19941203.0072;0	A promise by new President Ernesto Zedillo to reform Mexico 's corrupt and inefficient judicial system could prove to be the most difficult to fulfill .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;1	And the most important .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;2	Zedillo 's predecessor , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , always said his far-reaching economic reforms would eventually lead to the democratic and judicial reforms Mexico needs to become a truly modern , developed nation .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;3	Now it 's up to Zedillo to make sure that happens .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;4	Democracy and justice can not thrive in a country where the laws do not apply equally to all .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;5	`` It has to be done , '' said independent political analyst Sergio Sarmiento .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;6	`` Judicial reforms will be the most significant and difficult challenge of this administration . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;7	When he took office Thursday , Zedillo vowed one of his first acts would be to seek a constitutional amendment overhauling Mexico 's justice system .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;8	He said he would soon submit specific proposals to lawmakers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;9	`` I am determined to head the creation of a nation where the rule of law prevails , '' he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;10	`` In order to tackle the rampant crime , the frequent violations of civil and human rights , and the grave public insecurity , we will launch an in-depth and genuine reform of the institutions in charge of the procurement of justice , '' Zedillo added .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;11	Zedillo also named an opposition politician as his attorney general , the first such Cabinet appointment in the 65-year history of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party -LRB- PRI -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;12	Debate about Mexican justice has been heated in a year marked by the assassinations of two top PRI leaders and a rebel uprising in southern Mexico .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;13	Mexico 's is a system that often grants impunity to the rich and powerful -- too often party leaders -- while frequently denying basic human rights to the poor and powerless .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;14	From bribe-demanding traffic police to corrupt judges who let political cronies go free , the system has long been equated with graft , laziness and bureaucratic inpetitude .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;15	The chief investigator in the September assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the PRI secretary general , quit last month , charging that party leaders were blocking his probe .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;16	That revived questions about the March assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;17	Although officials insist Colosio was killed by a lone , deranged gunman , many Mexicans suspect a larger political conspiracy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;18	`` The brutal assassinations of two of Mexico 's most outstanding public figures have deeply hurt our citizens , sown seeds of ... doubt regarding some institutions , and divided the people of Mexico , '' Zedillo admitted .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;19	Meanwhile , demands for justice continue to echo from the mountains of southern Mexico , where Indian rebels are threatening to revive their New Year 's Day rebellion .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;20	The guerrillas maintain that a left-leaning candidate for governor was cheated out of victory during August elections .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;21	Zedillo seems to realize that the economic and democratic reforms Salinas accomplished during his administration can never be truly effective without judicial reforms .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;22	New laws against electoral fraud are pointless unless those who burn and steal ballots are arrested and prosecuted by honest judges .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;23	Economic reforms encouraging foreign investment wo n't work if businessmen still have to pay bribes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;24	Judicial reforms are likely to be opposed by many , including top government or party officials long considered above the law and the druglords who bribe police officers for protection .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;25	`` There are a lot of skeletons in the closet in Mexico , '' said Susan Kaufman Purcell , vice president of the New York-based Americas Society .
APW_ENG_19941203.0072;26	`` And a lot of people are going to be very reluctant to have those closets opened . ''

APW_ENG_19941203.0073;0	A military court on Saturday found 16 suspected Muslim extremists guilty in the killing of a German tourist and two Egyptians , and sentenced two to death .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;1	The others received prison terms ranging from five to 15 years .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;2	The ruling was handed down at the military base at Haekstep , which is about 15 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- northeast of Cairo .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;3	Earlier Saturday , two police guards were killed and two others wounded when suspected Muslim extremists opened fire on a police station in southern Egypt , security officials said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;4	The extremists fled with two of the policemen 's automatic rifles , the officials said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;5	The incident occurred in the town of Farshut in Qena province , about 465 kilometers -LRB- 290 miles -RRB- south of Cairo .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;6	The fatal attack on the German and Egyptians occurred Sept. 27 in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;7	Another German and an Egyptian were wounded in the shooting on a crowded downtown square .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;8	It was the first known incident involving Muslim radicals in the Hurghada area , and government officials fear it will hurt tourism there .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;9	Muslim radicals have waged a campaign of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt 's secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;10	More than 460 people have been killed , most of them police and extremists .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;11	Seven foreigners have been among the victims .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;12	Most of the violence has been blamed on al-Gamaa al-Islamiya , or the Islamic Group , which has been most active in southern Egypt in villages around the city of Assiut .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;13	Foreign reporters and Egyptian reporters with foreign news organizations were banned from covering most sessions of the trial but were permitted in Saturday to hear the verdicts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;14	Hearings began Nov. 5 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;15	The prosecutor had argued before the three-man military tribunal that the defendants wanted to damage Egypt 's economy by carrying out attacks on foreign tourists .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;16	Tourism is one of Egypt 's main sources of foreign currency .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;17	The two sentenced to death were Mohammed Omar Ahmed and Rabie Mahmoud Hassanein , who are accused of opening fire at the tourists .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;18	President Hosni Mubarak began referring Muslim extremist cases to military courts early last year to speed up the court process .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;19	This has been widely criticized by Egyptian and international human rights groups , which argue they should be heard in civilian courts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0073;20	Forty-three suspected extremists have been executed , all but two sentenced to die by military courts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;0	Former world junior champion Daniel Chopra of Sweden shot a 4-under-par 68 in Saturday 's final round to win the Malaysian PGA Golf title by two strokes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;1	Chopra , who was third after Friday 's third round , overcame bogeys on the par-4 first and second holes to beat his closest rival , Saneh Saengsui of Thailand , on the Tropicana Golf and Country Club course .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;2	`` After the two bogeys in the first and second , I told myself to go for a 67 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;3	And in the last five holes , I managed to go three-under and finally finished with a 68 which was not bad at all , '' said Chopra .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;4	The round , which was delayed for an hour due to heavy rain , gave Chopra a four-round total of 273 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;5	It was Chopra 's second win on Malaysian soil and his seventh victory since turning pro in 1991 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;6	Saengsui , who led after Friday 's third round , had to settle for second spot after an even-par round of 72 , while local pro Mohamed Ali Kadir , who was second Friday , took third place after posting a 72 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;7	Saengsui also had a bad start with bogeys on the first two holes , but managed to improve his score with birdies in the sixth , seventh and 13th holes for a 275 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;8	After the blunders on the first and second holes , Chopra kept his composure with birdies on the fourth , fifth , ninth , 10th , 15th and 18th holes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0074;9	For his win , Chopra received U.S. dlrs 5,100 , while Saengsui earned dlrs 3,850 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;0	Taiwan 's ruling Nationalists , fighting their toughest election in 45 years , took the lead in the race for the island 's governorship but were lagging in the contest for mayor of the capital , initial returns showed Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;1	With about 60 percent of the votes counted , incumbent Nationalist governor James Soong had 2.9 million , against 2.1 million for Chen Ting-nan , the candidate of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;2	But in Taipei , Nationalist Mayor Huang Ta-chou looked in trouble .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;3	With about 23 percent of votes counted , Huang had 90,000 , compared with 155,000 for the DPP 's Chen Shui-bian .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;4	A DPP victory in Taipei , Taiwan 's capital and largest city , would boost the credibility of the once-banned opposition and improve its chances in the island 's first direct presidential elections in 1996 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;5	But the Nationalists would draw comfort from winning the governorship , presently the highest fully elected post in Taiwan .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;6	In Kaohsiung , a port city on Taiwan 's southern coast , Nationalist incumbent Wu Tun-yi had a lead of more than 50,000 votes over the DPP 's Chang Chun-hsiung with about 30 percent of votes counted .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;7	Taiwanese thronged to the polls on foot , by car and even in wheelchairs to vote in the local elections , which marked a milestone in Taiwan 's 7-year-old transformation from virtual dictatorship to multi-party democracy .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;8	Never before had voters chosen a governor , and elections for mayor have not been held in Taipei and Kaohsiung since 1967 and 1979 respectively .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;9	Voters also chose local councils and the provincial assembly .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;10	State-run TV said polling stations closed on schedule at 4 p.m. -LRB- 0800 GMT -RRB- and results were expected about eight hours later .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;11	Newspapers and TV estimated that 70 percent to 80 percent of Taiwan 's 13.8 million eligible voters turned out .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;12	President Lee Teng-hui , who is credited with steering Taiwan through its transition to democracy , cast his vote in a Taipei stadium shortly after polling stations opened at 8 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;13	Voters lined up in the rain to vote in schools , sports grounds and Buddhist temples , sometimes waiting half an hour for their turn .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;14	Campaigning for the election was feverish and , at times , violent .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;15	No incidents were reported during the voting , but there were fears that violence might erupt after final results were announced .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;16	Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou appealed to people to watch the results on TV and not mass outside party headquarters .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;17	Police said 70,000 officers were deployed , and Lee appealed to Taiwanese to `` welcome a new era of democracy for all . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;18	The polls are a prelude to the 1996 presidential election .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;19	Lee 's prospects for another term will be measured by his Nationalists ' performance against the DPP , especially in the race for governor .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;20	The Nationalists fled to Taiwan to escape the 1949 Communist takeover of mainland China .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;21	They still say they hope one day to reunite Taiwan with the Chinese motherland .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;22	But the DPP advocates Taiwanese independence , something China has vowed to resist by force , claiming Taiwan is a renegade province .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;23	Campaigning focused largely on `` Tong-Du '' -- reunification vs. independence -- and DPP successes could provoke misgivings in Beijing .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;24	Business leaders placed newspaper ads warning that Taiwan 's dollar and the island 's standing with investors could plummet if pro-independence forces gained power .
APW_ENG_19941203.0076;25	But the DPP may profit from a split in the Nationalist vote caused by the recently formed New Party , which quit the Nationalists last year , accusing them of abandoning the commitment to reunification .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;0	U.S. telecommunications firm AT and T has won a bid to supply Vietnam with its first automatic bank teller machines , a business publication said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;1	The company defeated fellow American competitors IBM and Digital Equipment in bidding to sell the machines to Vietnamese commercial banks , the Vietnam Investment Review reported .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;2	The review is published by the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment , which regulates foreign investment here .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;3	The review quoted AT and T representative Medi Pepper as saying the firm had n't yet signed a contract for the sale .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;4	The State Bank of Vietnam announced plans earlier this year to install 30 to 40 automatic teller machines in the country 's major cities by the middle of 1995 .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;5	It estimated the equipment would cost dlrs 2.8 million .
APW_ENG_19941203.0077;6	A modern banking system is one of Vietnam 's key development priorities as it seeks to double per capita national income to dlrs 450 by the end of the decade .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;0	Sixteen people were injured Saturday in a mass pileup involving about 70 vehicles on an icy , foggy highway , police said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;1	Police said the accident happened about 7 a.m. -LRB- 0600 GMT -RRB- on the main route from St. Gallen to Rorschach in northeastern Switzerland .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;2	Cars , apparently traveling too fast in the bad conditions , skidded into each other on the slippery surface , causing chaos within a matter of minutes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;3	Rescue vehicles were delayed by the resulting traffic jams .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;4	A helicopter trying to reach the injured was unable to land because of the thick fog .
APW_ENG_19941203.0079;5	Police said two of the injured were in a serious condition .

APW_ENG_19941203.0080;0	Vietnam has not discussed letting U.S. ships use port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay , the naval base American forces built during the Vietnam War , the government said Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;1	Vietnam 's Foreign Affairs Ministry issued the denial when asked about Western news reports that the two countries have talked about arranging for American naval ships to call once again at the deep water port in former South Vietnam .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;2	`` The issue of Cam Ranh has so far never been mentioned in any of the talks or meetings between the U.S. and Vietnam , '' the ministry said in a statement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;3	U.S. Admiral Richard C. Macke told reporters during an official visit to Hanoi in October that he did not rule out future military cooperation between Vietnam and the United States , once the former enemies showed more political and economic cooperation .

APW_ENG_19941203.0080;5	But he added that he did not specifically discuss the port with Vietnamese officials .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;6	The ministry statement refutes speculation that Vietnam is keen to let the U.S. Navy use the port as a way to counterbalance Chinese ambitions in the region .

APW_ENG_19941203.0080;9	China 's Foreign Ministry objected last month to a suggestion that the United States might want to return to Cam Ranh Bay .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;10	China opposes the idea of any country basing its troops or forces on foreign soil , a Chinese ministry spokesman said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;11	After the Vietnam War , Hanoi allowed the Soviet Union to base its ships and submarines at Cam Ranh Bay .
APW_ENG_19941203.0080;12	Russian vessels still refuel there , but their presence is greatly reduced .

APW_ENG_19941203.0082;1	But police reported 12 people killed Friday night and Saturday in a series of shootings , including two that targeted government officials .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;2	`` Karachi is bleeding and I have come to press for peace , '' said social worker Nargis Latif , who like most of the marchers dressed in white to signify peace .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;3	Before the march ended , there were fresh reports of violence .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;4	In one attack Saturday , two drivers who worked at the main government office were kidnapped and their bullet-riddle bodies discovered hours later .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;5	On Friday night , three workers were fatally shot when gunmen opened fire outside the house of the country 's labor minister , Akbar Lasi .

APW_ENG_19941203.0082;8	Government services have all but collapsed and many residents complain of a general sense of lawlessness .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;9	Saturday 's march , organized by the country 's leading newspaper publisher , began in the center of the city at the mausoleum of Mohammed Ali Jinnah , Pakistan 's founding father .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;10	In a festive atmosphere that included music and signing , the marchers traveled almost 10 kilometers -LRB- 6.2 miles -RRB- to the headquarters of the provincial government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;11	One of the march leaders was Imran Khan , Pakistan 's most famous cricket player .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;12	Marchers threw rose petals on Khan and a number of film and television stars who took part in the procession .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;13	The army , which patrolled the streets of Karachi for the past 30 months , was withdrawn Wednesday and many fear the police force and a paramilitary unit will be unable to maintain control .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;14	The unrest has disrupted business in the country 's financial capital and frightened away potential foreign investors .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;15	Much of the violence pits the security forces against the Mohajir Quami Movement , a powerful opposition group that represents mohajirs , or Muslim immigrants from India .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;16	The MQM accuses Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of discriminating against mohajirs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0082;17	Ms. Bhutto 's government , meanwhile , says the MQM is a terrorist organization that uses violence to advance its cause .

APW_ENG_19941203.0083;7	Bolzano head coach , Bob Manno , a former player for the Vancouver Canucks , Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings , said of Jagr : `` He definitely keeps the other team on their heels .

APW_ENG_19941203.0084;1	Navy and coast guard divers , meanwhile , suspended a second day of searching for bodies trapped inside the ferry Cebu City after recovering the body of an elderly woman early in the day .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;2	The ferry was carrying 608 people when it collided with the Kota Suria , a Singaporean-registered freighter , before dawn Friday and quickly sank .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;3	At least 110 people are still missing , coast guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Loreto dela Cueva said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;4	Dela Cueva said divers were unable to open the cabin doors because some were locked and others were blocked by debris .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;5	He said equipment to pry open the doors will be brought in by divers Sunday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;6	He said 453 people had been rescued , including two survivors brought to Manila Saturday after fishermen plucked them from the sea near Cavite province late Friday .

APW_ENG_19941203.0084;9	`` There could be some negligence on the part of those manning the ship at the time of the incident , '' Cabug said .

APW_ENG_19941203.0084;12	A ferry crewman told reporters the freighter rammed the Cebu City at midsection , crushing the bridge and pinning the skipper and several other officers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;13	It is still unclear which vessel had the right of way in the passage at the time .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;14	Coast Guard officers began interviewing Paquito Miraflor , the Filipino captain of the Kota Suria , after the freighter docked at the Manila harbor to unload more than 200 steel containers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;15	Officers declined to give details of the investigation and Miraflor refused to be interviewed .
APW_ENG_19941203.0084;16	But at least two of his crew members described the first few moments following the collision .

APW_ENG_19941203.0085;2	The more than 400 Canadians at the camp were watching every news bulletin on television and monitoring political developments in the capital of Sarajevo .
APW_ENG_19941203.0085;3	`` Everybody here is up and hoping they 'll be released today , '' said Maj. Geoff Hall , second in command at the camp .
APW_ENG_19941203.0085;4	`` Personally , I assume nothing in Bosnia , but this time this promise just might be for real . ''

APW_ENG_19941203.0086;7	The Canadians have been held for 10 days at various sites in Serb-held territory near Visoko .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;8	Hall said the detained Canadians , who are in radio contact with the camp , said this morning there was no indication they were about to be released .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;9	`` There is no change among our detained Canadians , so we 'll just have to wait this one out and see what happens . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;10	UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Friday Serb leaders agreed to release Ukrainian peacekeepers in northern Bosnia , as well as Dutch and British convoys detained since last Saturday .

APW_ENG_19941203.0086;12	But Defense Minister David Collenette said in Ottawa on Friday Canadian officers in Bosnia could n't confirm the reports of agreement .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;13	And Maj. Rita Lepage , a Canadian military spokeswoman in Zagreb , Croatia , said today there was no timetable for the release .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;14	But she did not dismiss the Serb agreement as just another broken Serb promise to the UN .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;15	`` This is certainly the most encouraging development so far , '' she said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;16	The Serbs did release 70 Dutch troops in good condition Friday but are holding about 300 more to discourage NATO air strikes against a Serb siege of the Muslim pocket of Bihac , a UN-declared safe haven in northwest Bosnia .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;17	About 20 Canadians are at a police complex in the village of Ilijas .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;18	The rest are at checkpoints and observation posts .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;19	Maj. Dean Milner , senior officer among the detainees , is able to drive around in his vehicle and visit his soldiers .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;20	The Serbs also let supply vehicles from camp bring the soldiers mail , food and other items .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;21	Hall said the Canadians , if released , would be given at least 24 hours to rest before being allowed to give media interviews .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;22	The camp was making preparations Friday for their release , including stocking up on food for a special steak-and-eggs meal for detainees .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;23	The detainees , when released , will be debriefed , given time to rest and then allowed to `` get things off their chest '' at counselling sessions with people of their own rank , Hall said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;24	The camp stayed at the high alert level of orange today , which requires personnel to wear flak jackets and helmets when moving around outside .
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;25	Hall said the camp will stay at orange until the `` whole detention problem is over . ''
APW_ENG_19941203.0086;26	Meanwhile , in Paris on Friday , Peter Donolo , a spokesman for Prime Minister Jean Chretien , said : `` Obviously we 're encouraged by the developments .

APW_ENG_19941203.0087;0	LAGOS , Nigeria -LRB- AP -RRB- - An explosion at a gas plant in the southern oil-producing region of Rivers state killed six workers and seriously injured four , a newspaper reported Saturday .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;1	The blast occurred Tuesday at a plant owned by the Italian oil company Agip as workers were welding valves , the state-run Lagos Times reported .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;2	Residents of the village where the plant is located , Obrikom , fled as the blast sent a fireball into the sky and sparked blazes in nearby homes .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;3	The accident was the second fatal explosion in a week to hit Nigeria 's beleaguered oil industry , which fuels the economy but has also been targeted by anti-government activists demanding an end to military rule .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;4	Last week , an explosion at a pipeline killed 10 people .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;5	Officials blamed that incident on saboteurs trying to cut into the line to steal oil .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;6	Oil accounts for at least 80 percent of the Nigerian government 's export earnings , but the industry suffers frequent accidents because of lax safety standards caused by mismanagement and corruption .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;7	The government owns majority shares in all international oil companies operating in Nigeria .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;8	The oil minister , Don Etiebet , was quoted in Lagos newspapers Saturday as saying the military government was considering several options , including privatization , as a way to improve management in the industry .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;9	Political unrest , including a nine-week oil workers ' strike , and government subsidies on oil prices have made the country 's refineries far less productive than they could be , he said .
APW_ENG_19941203.0087;10	`` The government may resort to the sale of refining and distribution assets in part or in whole to the highest bidder or companies with a track record in refinery management , '' Etiebet said .

APW_ENG_19941203.0091;2	Hariri , once hailed as the savior of a country ravaged by 15 years of civil war , said Friday he would resign after more than two years in office .
APW_ENG_19941203.0091;3	He has long been frustrated by opposition to his economic and reconstruction policies by several Cabinet ministers allied with neighboring Syria , the undisputed power in Lebanon .
APW_ENG_19941203.0091;4	His resignation would be a severe setback to efforts to rebuild Lebanon from the destruction of the 1975-90 civil war which killed 150,000 people , maimed tens of thousands and caused an estimated dlrs 25 billion in damage .
APW_ENG_19941203.0092;0	Bosnian Foreign Minister Ifran Ljubijankic Saturday agreed in writing that his country 's Muslim-led government will cooperate fully with the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal .
APW_ENG_19941203.0092;1	And tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said a similar agreement will soon be signed with the Croatian government .
APW_ENG_19941203.0092;2	However the Bosnian Serb government and Serbian authorities in Belgrade both have indicated that they will not cooperate with the Tribunal and the vast majority of war crimes in the Balkan conflict are attributed to ethnic Serbs .
APW_ENG_19941203.0092;3	The only man so far indicted by the U.N. Tribunal is Dragan Nikolic , a Bosnian Serb alleged to have commanded a concentration camp for Bosnian Muslims .
